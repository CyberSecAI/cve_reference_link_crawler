The provided content is related to CVE-2024-38879.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The affected system exposes the port of an internal application on the public network interface. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain direct access to the exposed application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The system fails to properly validate or restrict access to the internal application, leading to its exposure on the public interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality loss: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the exposed internal application potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, though the impact is limited to confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by connecting to the exposed port on the public network interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the public network interface of the affected system. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
