## Vulnerabilities

* [Medium] [CVE-2024-1544](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grjj-54gm-q5vf "CVE-2024-1544")

  Potential ECDSA nonce side channel attack in versions of wolfSSL before 5.6.6 with wc\_ecc\_sign\_hash calls. Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Analyzing the division through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. Thanks to Luca Wilke, Florian Sieck and Thomas Eisenbarth (University of Lübeck) for reporting the vulnerability. Details will appear in the proceedings of CCS 24.

  Fixed [#7020](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7020)
* [Medium] [CVE-2024-5288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrg9-cmw9-3pwx "CVE-2024-5288")

  A private key blinding operation, enabled by defining the macro WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY, was added to mitigate a potential row hammer attack on ECC operations. If performing ECC private key operations in an environment where a malicious user could gain fine control over the device and perform row hammer style attacks it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used and to build with WOLFSSL\_BLIND\_PRIVATE\_KEY defined. Thanks to Kemal Derya, M. Caner Tol, Berk Sunar for the report (Vernam Applied Cryptography and Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)

  Fixed in github pull request [#7416](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7416)
* [Low] When parsing a provided maliciously crafted certificate directly using wolfSSL API, outside of a TLS connection, a certificate with an excessively large number of extensions could lead to a potential DoS. There are existing sanity checks during a TLS handshake with wolfSSL which mitigate this issue. Thanks to Bing Shi for the report.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7597](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7597)
* [Low] [CVE-2024-5991](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwjf-h4v6-qrpp "CVE-2024-5991")

  In the function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the Openssl compatibility function X509\_check\_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. While calling without a NULL terminated string is very uncommon, it is still technically allowed. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non\*NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7604](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604)
* [Medium] [CVE-2024-5814](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8cr7-x5g8-m3f3 "CVE-2024-5814")

  A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7619](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7619)
* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 response verification bypass issue when a crafted response of length 0 is received. Found with internal testing.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7702](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702)
* [Medium] OCSP stapling version 2 revocation bypass with a retry of a TLS connection attempt. A revoked CA certificate could incorrectly be loaded into the trusted signers list and used in a repeat connection attempt. Found with internal testing.

  Fixed in github pull request [#7702](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7702)
