Please refer to the **[Patch Installation](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/patch_installation)** page for Patch Installation instructions.
As always, you are encouraged to tell us what you think in the Forums or open a support ticket to report issues

## Deprecation of Zimbra Server on Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 End of life occurred on April 29, 2021. Zimbra will deprecate Kepler 9.0.0 support for Ubuntu 16.04 as of **December 31, 2023**. At this date, there will no longer be any patch release for Zimbra Kepler 9.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 operating system. We encourage all our new customer's to use **Ubuntu 20.04** for all their new installations.

For questions or guidance with upgrading your operating system please open a support case and our Support team is here to assist you.

## Changes required for SSO setup before patch upgrade

Before upgrade, if the **zimbraVirtualHostName** parameter is not set for the domains that are using SAML and SSO based login, please set by following the instructions:

```
su - zimbra
zmprov md domain_name zimbraVirtualHostName virtual_hostname

```

 **Note: Additional configuration for further hardening your Zimbra setup can be found on the [Zimbra Support Portal](https://support.zimbra.com). It is recommended that all customers consider these additional steps.**

**IMPORTANT: Zimbra OpenSSL with default FIPS Configuration**

* Please be advised that, TLS 1.2 is the minimum supported version if FIPS is being used with OpenSSL 3.0. We recommend using Zimbra with strong TLS configuration for increased security. Please follow instructions in **[Cipher-suites-wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites)** to set correct ciphers as per current versions of openssl, nginx and postfix.

* From this patch going forward Zimbra OpenSSL will be configured to work with FIPS compliance enabled by default. You do not need to take any action, unless you run into issues, you can switch to the non-FIPS provider as follows:

* Run below commands to Enable/Disable FIPS providers on all servers.

Disable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-source.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-source.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is disabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is not listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

Enable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-fips.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-fips.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is enabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

# What's New

## Package Upgrade

* The Nginx package has been upgraded to 1.24.0
## Modern Web App

**General**

* "New Email" and "Find Emails" options are displayed in the context menu for a Distribution List member when multiple members are selected.
* The event invitee selection process was enhanced to allow for choosing specific members from a distribution list (DL).
* Users now have the ability to easily drag and drop their own calendar events to a different date or time slot.
* Event invitations have been enhanced to alert users of any scheduling conflicts upon receipt of the invite.

**Mail**

* Users can now select specific or all members of a distribution list (DL) while composing an email.

**Contacts**

* “Distribution Lists” has been implemented for Contacts vertical.

# Fixed Issues

## Modern Web App

**General**

* Modern UI did not load images for some specific messages [ZBUG-3829]
* Composing mail was slower when folder pane had hundreds of folders [ZBUG-3804]
* Users were unable to rename files in Briefcase when filenames contained Chinese characters [ZBUG-3795]
* The "Reply-All" functionality worked differently in Modern and Classic UI. It has now been standardized for consistency [ZBUG-3605]

## Mobile Sync

**Rolling Upgrade - MobileSync**

* In a Rolling-upgrade environment, if a zimbra-9 user shares a calendar with zimbra-10 user, the shared calendar events are not synced on the mobile for zimbra-10 user. The issue has been fixed.

# Known Issues

* While deploying zimlets, if the following error is encountered, please refer to the **[Patch Installation](#Patch_Installation)** page to install the **zimbra-common-core-jar, zimbra-common-core-libs, zimbra-mbox-store-libs** packages in a particular order and re-deploy the zimlets.

```

```

* From Kepler-Patch-25 onwards, customers using SSO will need to update `zimbraVirtualHostName` attribute for the domains. Please refer to the  **[instructions](#Changes_required_for_SSO_setup_before_patch_upgrade)** to update the attribute.

* With OpenJDK 17, weaker Kerberos encryption types like 3DES and RC4 have now been disabled by default. This can cause SPNEGO auth to fail if described encryption types are being used. We recommend using stronger encryption types like AES256.

To get SPNEGO auth working with weak encryption types, weak encryption can be enabled by setting the **allow\_weak\_crypto** property to true in the krb5.conf configuration file. Please follow below instructions:

1. In **/opt/zimbra/jetty\_base/etc/krb5.ini.in -> [libdefaults]** section, set **allow\_weak\_crypto = true**

2. Restart mailboxd service:

```
su - zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart

```
