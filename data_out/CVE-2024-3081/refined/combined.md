XSS in autocomplete

Similar to [#5971](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/5971)

Not exactly sure what the difference between "option" and "item" is but this seems to fix XSS with collection fields

### **[javiereguiluz](/javiereguiluz)** commented [Jan 13, 2024](#issuecomment-1890469177)

| Thanks Simo. This is explained in <https://tom-select.js.org/docs/#render-templates>  Each template is defined by a function that is passed two arguments (data and escape) and returns NodeDefinition with a single root element. The escape argument is a function that takes a string and escapes all special HTML characters. This is very important to use to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Let's merge and release this ASAP. |
