Document Target Audience and Security Classification:

Target Audience: Customer & Service Partner & Fujitsu - Document Classification: Unclassified

PROBLEM / DESCRIPTION

In  Jul.  2023,  the  Fujitsu  PSIRT  received  internal  intelligence  on  a  vulnerability,  present  in  Fujitsu  Software
Infrastructure Manager (ISM).

That  vulnerability  resides  in  component  "ismsnap"  (in  this  specific  case  at:  /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/
FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) of the ISM software, used for the collection of maintenance data.
The  vulnerability  allows  for  the  insecure  collection  and  storage  of  authorization  credentials  in  clear-text.  Such
credentials may include:

•  User credentials (passwords), when performing any ISM "Firmware Repository Address" setup test ("Test the

Connection").

•  User credentials (passwords), when performing regular authorizations against an already configured remote

firmware repository site, as set up in ISM "Firmware Repository Address".

A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather such  "ismsnap" maintenance data,  either regularly as a
trusted party allowed to export "ismsnap" data from ISM, or e.g. in case of compromise of the collecting agent / ISM
management  terminal,  primarily  if  that  maintenance  data  can  be viewed  by a  principal / authority other than  ISM
Admin. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are:

•  The "Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server)" function must be enabled and configured.

•  The character "\" (backslash) must be used as user credential (i.e. user/ID or password) of the remote proxy

host / firmware repository server.

Note:  "ismsnap"  data  additionally  resides  in  ISM's  internal  "ismsnap"  archive  (DB)  and  local  file  system.  However,
access to these locations requires elevated privileges on the ISM appliance / system.

CATEGORY: GENERAL | NUMBER: ISS-IS-2023-071410 | VERSION: 2.0 | CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
DATE: SEPTEMBER 04, 2023 | PAGES: 3

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  has  no  knowledge  of  working  code  or  active  campaign,  able  to  potentially  exploit  this
vulnerability, at the time of publication.

SITUATION

Based on the intelligence information available, the Fujitsu PSIRT rated the vulnerability in summary, as a medium-
level threat to the Fujitsu product  portfolio, due to the medium criticality,  medium  risk  factor, and estimated low-
medium exploitability.

The U.S. MITRE and NIST ITL was requested by the Fujitsu PSIRT for publication of dedicated CVE ID CVE-2023-39903
on this vulnerability. The estimated CVSSv3 base score is Medium (5.9).

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  has  estimated  a  Fujitsu  ARF  (Affection  Risk  Factor),  based  on  the  component  prevalence,
component  security  record,  and  component  fix/mitigation  expenditure.  The  currently  estimated  Fujitsu  ARF  is
Medium (3).

SOLUTION / REMEDIATION

Relevant Fujitsu PSIRT members and adjacent development and engineering departments were already informed.

The Fujitsu PSIRT requested a mitigation of the underlying vulnerability, via software package update, and has also
provided further, internal recommendations on the remediation. Fujitsu product updates were already made
available.

A final update for the Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) is available:
https://security.ts.fujitsu.com/IndexDownload.asp?SoftwareGuid=D6CC3F50-7147-49F6-9A1F-1A81F3571BF0

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

At this point Fujitsu PSIRT issue ISS-IS-2023-071410, addressing that vulnerability, is MITIGATED/RESOLVED, but may
be updated as necessary, in the Fujitsu PSIRT PRODUCT SECURITY section of the Fujitsu Product Support website.

RECOMMENDATION

The  Fujitsu  PSIRT  recommends  customers  to  install  the  available  Fujitsu  product  updates  and  follow  general
security best practices.

Additionally, the Fujitsu PSIRT recommends to do the following:

•  ASSESSMENT:  Users  are  strongly  recommended  to  determine  if  a  customer  environment  is  at  risk,  due  to
previous  execution  of  "ismsnap"  and  its  collected  maintenance  data  being  accessible  by  a  principal  /
authority other than ISM Admin.

•  MITIGATION:  Users  are  strongly  recommended  to  delete  such  collected  maintenance  data  via  the  ISM
management terminal, especially if such data is accessible by a principal / authority other than ISM Admin, to
prevent any potential future abuse of such authorization credentials present in clear-text.

•  MITIGATION:  Users  are  recommended  to  immediately  change  any  passwords  used  in  context  of  the  ISM
"Firmware Repository Address" setup, in case such collected maintenance data was accessible by a principal
/ authority other than ISM Admin, and such users may have undesirably accessed "ismsnap" data.

•  PREVENTION: Users are recommended to employ character "@" instead of "\" (backslash) for user credential

(i.e. user/ID) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server, e.g. "user@domain".

•  ADVANCEMENT:  With  the  aid  of  the  Fujitsu  PSIRT,  the  Fujitsu  development  has  identified  further  minor
issues  in  SNMPv3  configuration  and  automatic  log  transfer,  where  ISM-internal  log  data  could  potentially
contain clear-text credentials. However, these are protected by the ISM administrative principal and cannot
be exported from ISM. Fujitsu has plans to mitigate these low criticality issues with ISM v2.9.0 in Sep. 2023.
