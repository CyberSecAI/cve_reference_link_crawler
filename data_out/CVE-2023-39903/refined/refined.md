- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `ismsnap` component of Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM), which insecurely collects and stores authorization credentials in clear text. This occurs when performing "Firmware Repository Address" setup tests or regular authorizations against a remote firmware repository.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure storage of credentials in clear text within the `ismsnap` maintenance data.
    - The use of backslash characters in user credentials exacerbates the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A privileged attacker can gain access to sensitive credentials (usernames and passwords) stored in clear text. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems or data. The attacker could be an internal party authorized to export ismsnap data, or an external attacker who has compromised a collection agent or ISM management terminal.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker with privileged access to `ismsnap` data, either as an authorized user or by compromising the system, can access the collected credentials.
    - Exploitation requires that the "Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server)" function is enabled and configured, and backslashes are used within user credentials of a remote proxy host or firmware repository server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Privileged access to ISM system or its data
    - Ability to export the maintenance data, either through legitimate access or via a compromise
    - The "Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server)" function must be enabled and configured on the system.
    - Backslash characters must be used in the user credentials
