Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability within the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda FH1202 router firmware. Specifically, user-supplied input from the `cmdinput` parameter is not properly sanitized and is directly passed to the `doSystemCmd` function, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, stemming from a lack of input sanitization/validation. The firmware fails to properly handle user-provided input from the `cmdinput` parameter before using it in a system command execution.
- **Direct use of user input:** The vulnerability arises from directly using the `cmdinput` string, assigned to `cmd_buf`, within the `doSystemCmd` without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- **Full control over the device:** This could result in complete control of the device, including access to sensitive information, modification of configurations, and potentially further attacks on other devices on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint. The `cmdinput` parameter in the POST data is where the malicious command is injected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, typically by being on the same network or having network access to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/exeCommand`) and the vulnerable parameter (`cmdinput`).
