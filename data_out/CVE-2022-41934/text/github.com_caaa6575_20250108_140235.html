# Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-menu-ui

Critical

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-6w8h-26xx-cf8q
Nov 21, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-menu-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 14.6-rc-1, < 13.10.8, < 14.4.3

## Patched versions

14.6-rc-1, 13.10.8, 14.4.3

## Description

### Impact

Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters of the menu macro.

The issue can be demonstrated by opening `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Bmenu%7D%7D%7B%7Bcache+id%3D%22menuMacro%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello+from+Groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fcache%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fmenu%7D%7D` where `<server>` is the URL of the XWiki installation. If this displays "Hello from Groovy!", the installation is vulnerable.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3.

### Workarounds

The [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/2fc20891e6c6b0ca05ee07e315e7f435e8919f8d) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be [imported](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Imports#HImportingXWikipages). The menu macro was basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the [patch for version of 13.10.8](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/59ccca24a8465a19f40c51d65fcc2c09c1edea16) can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and 14.4.3 should be appropriate.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
