Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3473:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content does relate to CVE-2016-3473. Both the Oracle Security Advisory document and the Exploit-DB entry mention CVE-2016-3473, associating it with Oracle BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because the Oracle BI Publisher's SOAP service does not properly sanitize incoming XML data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the application's failure to disable or properly handle external entities in XML processing. This allows an attacker to control the XML parser's behavior.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the server's filesystem, if the server has permissions to read the requested files, or access internal network resources if the server is capable of connecting to those internal resources.
- **Integrity:** While less likely based on the provided information, an attacker could theoretically modify data if the server has write permissions to specified file locations.
- **Availability:** The potential to cause the system to become unavailable if an attacker can force the system to allocate too many resources or by causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by sending malicious SOAP requests to the `/xmlpserver/services/ServiceGateway` endpoint.
- **SOAP Requests:** The specific SOAP actions vulnerable are `replyToXML` and `replyToXMLWithContext`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted Oracle BI Publisher server.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user credentials or prior authentication to the system.
- **HTTP Protocol:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit provides the specific SOAP requests that trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to control an external server and use the URL to the malicious file.
