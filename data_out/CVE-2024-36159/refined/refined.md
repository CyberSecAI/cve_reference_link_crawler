The provided content is a security bulletin that includes CVE-2024-36159 among a large list of vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**CVE-2024-36159:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The software is vulnerable to Stored XSS attacks. This occurs when user-supplied input is stored on the server and displayed to other users without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks. An attacker would need to inject malicious script which is then stored by the application, and later executed in the browser of a user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a low-privileged user who can store content in the AEM application. A victim needs to view the stored malicious content.
