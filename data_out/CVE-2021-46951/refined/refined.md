- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The global variable `efi_tpm_final_log_size` was being decremented each time the `tpm_read_log_efi` function was called due to the subtraction of `log_tbl->final_events_preboot_size`. When loading/unloading the TPM2 driver multiple times, this could lead to an integer underflow of the global variable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer underflow due to repeated subtraction of `final_events_preboot_size` from the global variable `efi_tpm_final_log_size`, potentially leading to incorrect memory allocation and out-of-bounds access.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An integer underflow of `efi_tpm_final_log_size` can result in incorrect memory allocation when copying the final events log, and can cause an out-of-bounds access in the `memcpy` call, leading to a kernel crash. The provided kernel crash log shows this memcpy failure scenario.

- **Attack vectors:** Repeatedly loading and unloading the TPM2 driver would trigger the `tpm_read_log_efi` function multiple times, causing the integer underflow.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to load and unload the TPM2 driver repeatedly.
