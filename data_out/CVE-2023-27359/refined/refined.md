- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way the `hotplugd` daemon handles firewall rules, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and reach services meant to be accessible only from the LAN.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A firewall rule race condition in the `hotplugd` daemon allows remote access to LAN-side services
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can gain access to LAN-side services. This vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attacks that do not require authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the device. No authentication is needed for exploitation.
