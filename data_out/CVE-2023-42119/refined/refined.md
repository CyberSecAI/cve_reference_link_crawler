  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable Exim service. Authentication is not required."
