# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-030 - Critical

## Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2509553)

Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: March 13, 2012

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows DNS resolution. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker gained access to the network and then created a custom program to send specially crafted LLMNR broadcast queries to the target systems. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the LLMNR ports should be blocked from the Internet.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. The security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the DNS client processes specifically crafted DNS queries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the DNS client service handles specially crafted LLMNR queries. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0657](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0657).

#### Mitigating Factors for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the LLMNR ports should be blocked from the Internet. See the FAQ below on blocking TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall.

#### Workarounds for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about the Windows Firewall, see [How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/smallbusiness/prodtech/windowsxp/cfgfwall.mspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** Blocking connectivity to these ports will help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Disable Link-Local Mulitcast Name Resolution using group policy**

  To disable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
  2. Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.
  3. Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Enabled**, and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
  2. Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.
  3. Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Disabled**, and then click **OK**.
* **Turn off Network Discovery**

  To turn off Network Discover, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Control Panel.
  2. Click **Network and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.
  3. Under Network Discovery, click **Turn off network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.

  **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable Network Discovery, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Control Panel.
  2. Click Network **and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.
  3. Under Network Discovery, click **Turn on network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.

#### FAQ for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, this is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code in the context of the NetworkService account.

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, this is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker with user credentials could exploit the vulnerability, resulting in an elevation of privilege that could allow the attacker to execute code in the context of the NetworkService account.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the DNS client handles specially crafted LLMNR queries.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

DNSAPI.dll is the affected component.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would need access to the network. The attacker could then create a custom program to send specially crafted LLMNR broadcast queries to the target systems.

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and elevate the attacker's privileges to the NetworkService account.

**Can this vulnerability be remotely exploited in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003?**

No. LLMNR is not supported in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. The vulnerability in the DNS client still exists for these systems and is only exploitable locally by running a specially crafted application.

**What is LLMNR?**

Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a new protocol that provides an additional method to resolve the names of neighboring computers. LLMNR is especially useful for networks that do not have a Domain Name System (DNS) server. LLMNR uses a simple exchange of request and reply messages to resolve computer names to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) or IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses. For more information about LLMNR, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb878128.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the DNS client processes specifically crafted DNS queries.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **RegistryKeyVerification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
