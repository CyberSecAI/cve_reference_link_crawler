# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-030 - Critical

## Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2509553)

Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: March 13, 2012

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows DNS resolution. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker gained access to the network and then created a custom program to send specially crafted LLMNR broadcast queries to the target systems. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the LLMNR ports should be blocked from the Internet.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. The security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the DNS client processes specifically crafted DNS queries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2509553](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509553) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the DNS client service handles specially crafted LLMNR queries. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0657](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0657).

#### Mitigating Factors for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In Windows Vista and Windows 7, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the LLMNR ports should be blocked from the Internet. See the FAQ below on blocking TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall.

#### Workarounds for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about the Windows Firewall, see [How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/smallbusiness/prodtech/windowsxp/cfgfwall.mspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** Blocking connectivity to these ports will help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP port 5355 and UDP port 5355 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Disable Link-Local Mulitcast Name Resolution using group policy**

  To disable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
  2. Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.
  3. Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Enabled**, and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable link-local multicast name resolution using group policy, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
  2. Expand **Computer Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Network**, and then expand **DNS Client**.
  3. Double-click **Turn off Multicast Name Resolution**, click **Disabled**, and then click **OK**.
* **Turn off Network Discovery**

  To turn off Network Discover, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Control Panel.
  2. Click **Network and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.
  3. Under Network Discovery, click **Turn off network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.

  **Impact of workaround.** The computer may not be visible to other computers on the network.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable Network Discovery, perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Control Panel.
  2. Click Network **and Internet**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and then click **Change advanced sharing settings**.
  3. Under Network Discovery, click **Turn on network discovery**, and then click **Save changes**.

#### FAQ for DNS Query Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0657

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, this is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code in the context of the NetworkService account.

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, this is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker with user credentials could exploit the vulnerability, resulting in an elevation of privilege that could allow the attacker to execute code in the context of the NetworkService account.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the DNS client handles specially crafted LLMNR queries.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

DNSAPI.dll is the affected component.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would need access to the network. The attacker could then create a custom program to send specially crafted LLMNR broadcast queries to the target systems.

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and elevate the attacker's privileges to the NetworkService account.

**Can this vulnerability be remotely exploited in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003?**

No. LLMNR is not supported in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. The vulnerability in the DNS client still exists for these systems and is only exploitable locally by running a specially crafted application.

**What is LLMNR?**

Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a new protocol that provides an additional method to resolve the names of neighboring computers. LLMNR is especially useful for networks that do not have a Domain Name System (DNS) server. LLMNR uses a simple exchange of request and reply messages to resolve computer names to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) or IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses. For more information about LLMNR, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb878128.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the DNS client processes specifically crafted DNS queries.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
