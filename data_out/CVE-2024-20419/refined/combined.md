This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the password-change process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access the web UI or API with the privileges of the compromised user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cssm-auth-sLw3uhUy>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco SSM On-Prem and Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite (SSM Satellite).  **Note:** Cisco SSM On-Prem and Cisco SSM Satellite are the same product. For releases earlier than Release 7.0, this product was called Cisco SSM Satellite. As of Release 7.0, this product is called Cisco SSM On-Prem.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Smart Licensing Utility.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table, the left column lists software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.       | Cisco SSM On-Prem Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 8-202206 and earlier | 8-202212 |   | 9 | Not vulnerable |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.

# Critical Flaw in Cisco Smart Software Manager Allows Attackers to Control the Device

A critical vulnerability in the Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-prem) authentication system that allowed unauthenticated, remote attackers to change the password of any user, including that of administrators, has been fixed.

The vulnerability, [CVE-2024-20419,](https://scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2024-20419) affects Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM On-prem) and Cisco Manager Satellite (SSM Satellite). Both of these are the same products. Until the release of 7.0, SSM On-Prem software was called SSM Satellite.

Cisco has released [software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cssm-auth-sLw3uhUy) to address the vulnerability, as there are no workarounds.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the password-change process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. If the exploit is successful, the attacker gets access to the web UI or API with the privileges of the compromised user.

Customers are strongly advised to upgrade to the fixed software release to ensure their Smart Software Manager On-Prem installations are secured against any exploitation.
