- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks authorization checks and does not validate a request parameter in an AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated users to call arbitrary PHP functions with no arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to missing authorization and input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary PHP functions can be executed on the server, which can lead to full compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=memberhero_send_form` parameter and the `_memberhero_hook` parameter set to the desired PHP function to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific position to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send a HTTP request to the target server.
