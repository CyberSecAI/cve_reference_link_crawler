Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2018-2819:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

All documents confirm that CVE-2018-2819 is a vulnerability affecting MySQL/MariaDB.  The vulnerability is consistently included in lists of CVEs addressed by various security advisories and updates for multiple Linux distributions and software.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

- The CVE description does not provide specific detail about the root cause, describing it only as "unspecified vulnerability" within InnoDB.
- The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2019:1258 refers to it as “mysql: InnoDB multiple unspecified vulnerabilities (CPU Apr 2018)” and lists several other similar CVEs.
- The NetApp advisory refers to it as a "vulnerability in InnoDB".

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

- The vulnerability is within the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL/MariaDB.
- The descriptions are very generic, only noting "unspecified vulnerability".
- Some documents indicate multiple unspecified vulnerabilities are present in InnoDB.
- The specific nature of the flaw isn't disclosed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

- **General Impact:** Documents describe a risk of "unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server." (from NetApp advisory)
- **Specific impact from Red Hat:** Some Red Hat documents specify a risk of "unspecified vulnerability" with a moderate impact, and a possibility of partial or complete Denial of Service.
- The impact is rated as moderate (6.5) by NetApp and Red Hat (using CVSS v3).

**5. Attack Vectors**

- **Network:** Exploitation can occur over a network, although for certain cases, specific privileges are required.
- **Local:** Some vulnerabilities, particularly those related to privilege escalation or client programs, can be exploited locally.
- Some vulnerabilities have high attack complexity making them less likely to be exploited.
- Most exploitation scenarios do not require user interaction.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

- In most cases,  an attacker may require low privileges or existing user privileges to successfully exploit the vulnerability, though there are some instances where the vulnerability can be exploited remotely with no authentication required.
- Some documents mention that the attacker needs to be local or have high privileges for certain scenarios.
- Certain scenarios require a user to interact in order to trigger an attack.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerability:** Unspecified vulnerability within the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL/MariaDB.
- **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service (DoS) of the MySQL Server
- **Attack Vector:** Primarily network-based, though local exploits are possible for some issues. Some scenarios require specific privileges or user interaction to exploit.
- **Severity:** Moderate (CVSS 6.5)
- **Affected Software:** Multiple versions of MySQL and MariaDB, specifically through 5.5.59, through 5.6.39 and through 5.7.21, 10.0.x and 10.1.x respectively.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided documents highlight the importance of applying security patches, as attackers have reportedly been successful in exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Different vendors provide slightly different descriptions and impact assessments of the same CVE, but all refer to similar general problems with the InnoDB engine.
- Upgrading is the recommended resolution. Workarounds might be possible, but are not recommended as a permanent solution.
