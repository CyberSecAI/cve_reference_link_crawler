The provided content is related to a fix for a temporary data corruption vulnerability in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation, specifically within the `smb3_insert_range` function. This fix is associated with the `FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE` support.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the `smb3_insert_range` function, when handling file range insertion, does not properly invalidate the affected cached region. This can lead to a temporary corruption of file data when the inserted range overlaps with cached data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Data corruption:** The primary weakness is the potential for temporary data corruption due to the lack of cache invalidation.
- **Incorrect handling of cached data:** The code fails to discard cached data that could be affected by the insert range operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Temporary data corruption:** Exploitation of this vulnerability would result in temporary corruption of file data. The duration of the corruption would depend on caching behaviour.
- **Potential application errors/instability:** Corrupted data could cause errors in applications that read the affected data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a file operation utilizes the `FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE` functionality on a CIFS mounted file system.
- Specifically, when an insert range operation occurs and overlaps with cached data, the file data may get temporarily corrupted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to a CIFS mount:** The attacker needs access to a mounted CIFS filesystem on a Linux machine.
- **Ability to perform `FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE` operation:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE` operation on the target file.
- **Knowledge of file caching behavior:** To maximize impact, the attacker may benefit from knowledge about how the file data is cached.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix includes changes to properly invalidate the page cache before performing the insert range operation.
- The code also avoids rereading inode size repeatedly, improving the code clarity.

The patch addresses the vulnerability by:
1. Locking the inode.
2. Reading and storing the old end-of-file (EOF) value.
3. Invalidating the page cache with `filemap_invalidate_lock(inode->i_mapping)`.
4. Waiting for writeback to complete with `filemap_write_and_wait(inode->i_mapping)`.
5. Truncating the page cache range using `truncate_pagecache_range(inode, off, old_eof)`.
6. Unlocking the page cache with `filemap_invalidate_unlock(inode->i_mapping)` and inode with `inode_unlock(inode)`.
