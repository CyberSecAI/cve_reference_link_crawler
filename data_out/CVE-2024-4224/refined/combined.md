## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.

  [How to find the hardware version on a TP-Link device](/en/support/faq/46/)
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.
