      "details": "The firmware release notes for TL-SG1016DE(UN)_V7_1.0.1 Build 20240628 state: 'Bug fixed: 1. Fixed vulnerability on XSS and RSA Key.'",
       "root_cause": "XSS and RSA Key vulnerabilities",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "RSA Key vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "The details of the impact are not specified in the content. The presence of XSS vulnerability could lead to arbitrary script execution in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. The RSA key vulnerability could lead to the compromise of secure communication, or device control.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "XSS vulnerabilities typically involve injection of malicious scripts through input fields or URL parameters.",
         "RSA key vulnerability exploits typically target the cryptographic implementation in the firmware itself"
         ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to exploit the XSS vulnerability. An attacker would likely need to access the device or its network to exploit RSA key vulnerabilities, though specifics are not provided."
