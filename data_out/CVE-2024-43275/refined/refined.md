  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection. The victim, who is logged in, unknowingly triggers this request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
