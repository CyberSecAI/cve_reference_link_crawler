The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `slcan` driver's `tx_work` was being freed while still scheduled. This occurred because `slcan_close()` (tty side) did not call `flush_work(&sl->tx_work)`, while `slcan_netdev_close()` (netdev side) did. If the netdev was never set `UP`, and the tty received bytes forcing a write wakeup, the work could be scheduled but never flushed, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability due to the lack of flushing the work queue in `slcan_close()` in certain scenarios when netdev is not UP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A kernel crash can occur due to a NULL pointer dereference during the execution of the freed work queue item. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending data to a serial port (tty) associated with an slcan device while the corresponding network device is not in the UP state. This forces the scheduling of `tx_work` which may be freed later, resulting in use-after-free when the workqueue is processed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the tty device associated with an slcan interface and send data to it, and also prevent the netdev from being set UP.
