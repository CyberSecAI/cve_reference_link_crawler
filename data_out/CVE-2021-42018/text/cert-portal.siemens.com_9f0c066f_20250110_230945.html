WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict web server access in affected system(s) to ports 443/TCP and 22/TCP, to trusted IP

addresses only

• Restrict access to port 69/UDP to trusted IP addresses only, for the TFTP vulnerability

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect
devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37208

Improper neutralization of special characters on the web server configuration page could allow an
attacker, in a privileged position, to retrieve sensitive information via cross-site scripting.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

9.6
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Genera-
tion (’Cross-site Scripting’)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42016

A timing attack, in a third-party component, could make the retrieval of the private key possible, used
for encryption of sensitive data.

If a threat actor were to exploit this, the data integrity and security could be compromised.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42017

A new variant of the POODLE attack has left a third-party component vulnerable due to the implemen-
tation flaws of the CBC encryption mode in TLS 1.0 to 1.2.

If an attacker were to exploit this, they could act as a man-in-the-middle and eavesdrop on encrypted
communications.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.9
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42018

Within a third-party component, whenever memory allocation is requested, the out of bound size is not
checked.

Therefore, if size exceeding the expected allocation is assigned, it could allocate a smaller buffer
instead. If an attacker were to exploit this, they could cause a heap overflow.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.9
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42019

Within a third-party component, the process to allocate partition size fails to check memory boundaries.

Therefore, if a large amount is requested by an attacker, due to an integer-wrap around, it could result
in a small size being allocated instead.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.9
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42020

The third-party component, in its TFTP functionality fails to check for null terminations in file names.

If an attacker were to exploit this, it could result in data corruption, and possibly a hard-fault of the
application.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Siemens thanks the following party for its efforts:

• Siemens Energy for coordinated disclosure of CVE-2021-37208

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

On FIPS devices, if the TFTP feature is turned on, it is no longer considered to be in FIPS mode and
considered as regular ROS device (described in FIPS user manual)
