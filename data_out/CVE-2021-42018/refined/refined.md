- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within a third-party component where memory allocation requests do not check for out-of-bounds sizes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) occurs because a smaller buffer than requested might be allocated if the requested size exceeds expected limits, leading to potential overflows.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially cause a heap overflow, leading to a denial-of-service, data corruption or possibly arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in a privileged position (PR:H) and have the capability to send a crafted memory allocation request to trigger the overflow. Exploitation requires high access complexity (AC:H) and no user interaction (UI:N).
