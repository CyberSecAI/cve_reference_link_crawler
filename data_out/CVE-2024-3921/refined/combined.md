## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Gianism <= 5.1.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=gianism&view=setting
2. In the "URL Prefix" field, enter the payload `<img src=xss onerror=alert(1)>`
3. Save and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
