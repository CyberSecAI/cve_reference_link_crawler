- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High-privilege users, such as administrators, can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker, with administrator privileges, injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings via the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator level privileges to access the plugin settings page.
