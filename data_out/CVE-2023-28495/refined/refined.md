- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user to send a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
