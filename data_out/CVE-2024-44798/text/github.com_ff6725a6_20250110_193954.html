# Bus\_management

Bus Pass Management System Using PHP and MySQL 1.0

# Auditor:

Shouvik Dutta [@shouvik\_dutta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvik-dutta/)

# Description:

Cross-site Scripting detected in Bus Pass Management System Project 1.0

Admin Panel - Report of Pass Page is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting

The web application application includes improperly sanitized user input in the admin page specifically at `fromdate` & `todate` parameter at the /pass-bwdates-reports-details.php endpoint output it generates. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with a maliciously crafted link.

Vulnerable Endpoint - /pass-bwdates-reports-details.php
Vulnerable Parameter - `fromdate` & `todate`

# PoCs

`Vulnerable URL: /admin/pass-bwdates-reports-details.php`

```
