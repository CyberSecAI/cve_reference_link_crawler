```
Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `fromdate` and `todate` parameters at the `/admin/pass-bwdates-reports-details.php` endpoint are not sanitized before being outputted to the page.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/pass-bwdates-reports-details.php` endpoint, where the `fromdate` parameter contains malicious JavaScript code.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No special privileges are mentioned for exploitation.
