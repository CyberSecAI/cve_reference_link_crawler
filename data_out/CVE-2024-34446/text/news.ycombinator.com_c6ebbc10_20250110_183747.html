I initially had mixed feelings about it as well. On the other hand the campaign we did in Stockholm last year worked out quite well. It managed to affect both domestic and EU legislative discussions at the time. Or at least our campaign contributed to moving the discussion in the right direction. How much is that worth? I'm not sure, but the reason we started Mullvad in the first place was to conduct political action through entrepreneurship, specifically regarding mass surveillance and censorship. If nothing else it seems to amuse a lot of people, including me and my colleagues. When I first heard of the idea of plastering privacy propaganda all over some major U.S. cities my initial reaction was more or less "lol, we can just do that?". As it turns out we can. :) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [j0e1](user?id=j0e1) [8 months ago](item?id=40250490)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40249999) | [next](#40251583) [–]  Thank you for sharing that! I am definitely part of the HN group think that tends to be irked by mass marketing- mainly because of baggage from the past of false advertising. However, I do agree that getting the non-IT geek's attention is what would actually move the needle for political action. I was amused (mostly surprised) to see a billboard while driving down the 110 in LA. More importantly, it led to a cool discussion with my non-tech wife who now appreciates your guys' brand more. :) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chefandy](user?id=chefandy) [8 months ago](item?id=40250731)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40250490) | [next](#40251583) [–]  As frustrating as it is, even great products don't sell themselves. I find much, if not most marketing for subscription-based services pretty scummy, but it's not like it has to be, and I'd much rather see physical ads than how most stuff gets surreptitiously slipped into my surveillance-capitalism-sponsored life. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [walterbell](user?id=walterbell) [8 months ago](item?id=40251583)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40249999) | [prev](#40250490) | [next](#40250976) [–]  *> plastering privacy propaganda all over some major U.S. cities* The ads are great to see in NYC subway and giant billboard near NY Times HQ.

You are of course referring to System Transparency. I feel obligated to point out that we have yet to fully implement that idea.

I can't speak for my marketing colleagues but I would assume they reason about it. It seems like a complex system to me, which means the approach kind of has to be (1) forming an understanding of the system and (2) deciding whether one is comfortable with the uncertainty. One aspect that makes the cost/benefit assessment quite a bit easier is that we don't only care about how many new paying customers we get. It's also fun to do this kind of advertisement. How many interesting conversations about privacy have been had as a result of people seeing our billboards? That's worth something too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nickburns](user?id=nickburns) [8 months ago](item?id=40250419)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40249999) | [prev](#40250808) | [next](#40249093) [–]  thank you for offering up in this forum at least your own personal contributions to your organization's position on its advertising campaigns. not sure if any official statements on the matter have been made elsewhere, but you've assuaged at least my own slight concern about it with this one. truly.

Billboard advertisements are an awareness type of advertisement. I'd be much more concerned to learn about paid endorsements, which they document on their website that they specifically do not do. Endorsements are a much more sensitive form of advertising, where once money trades hands for an endorsement, it stops being a useful third party assessment and starts being an advertisement disguised as a third party assessment. Awareness advertisements just make good business sense, so I'm genuinely curious why those would shy anybody away. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [int\_19h](user?id=int_19h) [8 months ago](item?id=40251269)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40250222) | [next](#40250348) [–]  I agree with you, but I also understand where GP is coming from.

Mullvad itself is extremely clear that use of a VPN alone is not enough for the reasons you stated. Mullvad VPN (which is what they advertised) is a suite of products and services, some of which are: - DNS services (ads, tracking) - A privacy-optimized browser (cookies, fingerprinting) - Network services like multihop routing (many benefits such as resistance to timing attacks) All of these services are included with your subscription at no additional cost. I feel like the claim of preventing ad tracking is as legitimate as it could possibly be. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nick238](user?id=nick238) [8 months ago](item?id=40249443)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40248880) | [prev](#40250222) | [next](#40248249) [7 more]  [flagged] | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ziddoap](user?id=ziddoap) [8 months ago](item?id=40249588)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40249443) | [next](#40250163) [–]  Holy unsubstantiated accusations, batman.

It's just a bulk pile of cards, Amazon records you bought one but doesn't know which one (and the actual code is under a scratch-to-reveal surface). Even if a three-letter agency intercepted your package and swapped your gift card with a known code, I believe Mullvad is not recording the connection between specific gift code and the account number. You can also exchange unscratched gift cards with friends and strangers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ziddoap](user?id=ziddoap) [8 months ago](item?id=40249724)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40249699) | [prev](#40250044) | [next](#40251416) [–]  Indeed.

We launched Mullvad 15 years ago. During those 15 years people's interest and awareness of online security and privacy has grown considerably, as has the consumer VPN market. 2. Our strategy is quite different from most of our competitors'. As a result we've grown slower than several of them, but we have nevertheless continued to grow year after year. 3. The costs of the campaign are perhaps lower than you assume. tl;dr We've slowly grown over many years and are now making enough money to plaster privacy propaganda over your city.

In some lines of business, like (purely hypothetically) security, it might actually be a bad thing for your business if you do.

And VPNs are pretty far out in the "just trust me bro" realm of handing over all your browsing habits with no ability to check their real behavior. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yencabulator](user?id=yencabulator) [8 months ago](item?id=40250148)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40248249) | [next](#40250266) [–]  Mullvad is trying pretty darn hard to be as far from "just trust me bro" as is feasible. If you do take their word for how they run their systems (/are working toward), their servers are diskless (what logs?), will only run software signed by their infrastructure team, and will remotely attest that their software has not been tampered with. This is so very, very, far away from the typical VPN company that any such comparison sounds ridiculous to me. Just the pretense of doing all this work costs so much that a greedy biz bro simply wouldn't. <https://github.com/mullvad/system-transparency> <https://www.system-transparency.org> <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29903695> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kfreds](user?id=kfreds) [8 months ago](item?id=40250317)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40250148) | [next](#40251662) [–]  Thank you for noticing!

Yes. It is quite an interesting situation, really. It's also a fun challenge! To what extent can we prove that we are trustworthy, and using what tools? Do those tools exist or do we have to invent them? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fragmede](user?id=fragmede) [8 months ago](item?id=40251774)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40250266) | [next](#40254254) [–]  You'd have to invent this one at least, as it currently doesn't exist. As the DNS server operator, you can view all my DNS queries. In a zero-trust environment where I don't trust you not to log all user queries and forwards them to the NSA, you'd need to use homomorphic encryption and create a DNS client and server than can do a lookup, without you, the DNS server operator, from finding out what the DNS lookup was of. <https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs> claims to have implemented this at a level that's practical for real world applications, with a demo for a wikipedia server, but it's far too slow, as demoed, for use as DNS server. Now, the fact of the matter is that you can map my account ID back to the IP I'm connecting from, but with very limited way to map from my IP to my identity protects that in many ways, but data-mining at scale, knowing how many users connecting to one proxy server from city X, would be worth something to advertising and related companies who are more interested in large habits of users. If it turns out no one uses the pirate bay anymore, but use torrent site XYZ, I know where I'd place my advertising dollars for, say, a VPN product. This is on the extreme end, but you asked for a fun challenge! :) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kfreds](user?id=kfreds) [8 months ago](item?id=40252475)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40251774) | [next](#40254254) [–]  Thanks! :) I should've been more clear.

And I'm, like, half okay with that - it's entirely justified paranoia, bad actors of all skill levels undeniably exist and they hide successfully for many years, but I do believe good actors exist. It's why I chose mullvad. At best you have stuff like attestation... but we all know those have a long history of being flawed and are subject to loads of side channels that can't be attested against. Plus VPNs are such a honeypot in every conceivable way that TONS of state-actor-level efforts are entirely reasonable, and that could easily include cheating on basically all attestation systems imaginable. We're just kinda stuck trusting history and lack of public leaks / correlated actions / whistleblowers IMO. Or, frankly, the Mozilla partnering counts for a lot to me. I won't use their setup because it doesn't have non-vpn-app options, but they're a group I mostly trust to have people's safety at heart. Personally, stuff like Tor (where by construction you only need to touch a couple good actors to be reasonably secure, and anyone can contribute) is about the only mostly-actually-trustworthy kind of system. You can *expect* malicious actors to participate there, and still have a reasonable level of privacy, particularly if you check a few personally (which is feasible because anyone can contribute). Tor and similar have plenty of issues, but structurally they're much more sound by design than any centralized VPN can ever be. Now if only they were even a tiny fraction as usable... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [reaperman](user?id=reaperman) [8 months ago](item?id=40248340)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40248249) | [prev](#40250266) | [next](#40251577) [–]  I think legally they would have to change their ownership directive document in Switzerland to allow the board of directors to allow the two founders to sell more than 50% of their shares.

As far as I know there is no official flashlight app (though recently there is a built in flashlight feature). How is Google responsible for a third party app that refuses to work without an internet access? GP is saying that the Android permissions model requires giving Internet access to any app you install from the Play Store; there isn't a way for an app to request "zero permissions" (or rather, there is, but basic Internet access is a permission granted to all apps, even when zero additional entitlements are requested). That said, this isn't unique to Android. At least as of a few years ago, iOS did more or less the same thing. (You can disable an app's access to the *local* network, but that's not the same thing as denying (or requiring an app to request) basic network connectivity). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [toast0](user?id=toast0) [8 months ago](item?id=40248789)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248404) | [next](#40248500) [–]  Google doesn't let you deny permissions for most of them.

Another guy did make a unofficial LOS for it though. Custom ROMs nowadays require you to be scouring Qualcomm out of tree source repositories (or firmware dumps of equivalent phones, I think, in the case of Mediatek). It's impossible to guarantee quality with this conditions. Even if you just want to have a pristine kernel tree of the original firmware you may find, if it was ever released, it was squashed on the wrong source commit (again, laurel\_sprout, though a random Github angel fixed it). So Google's devices tend, thankfully, to have better sources. Additionally, GOS team is competent and, for now, sustained full-time by donations. Those three conditions are what allow GOS to be a very good ROM. Do note: it has its quirks, specially with the new trimestral code dumps by Google where half-baked features are on the source (though disabled by feature flags). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codethief](user?id=codethief) [8 months ago](item?id=40252791)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248658) | [prev](#40251379) | [next](#40249387) [–]  I've used GrapheneOS for years and I'm doing banking on my phone just fine. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MrDrMcCoy](user?id=MrDrMcCoy) [8 months ago](item?id=40249387)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248658) | [prev](#40252791) | [next](#40254484) [–]  My banking apps worked for me on GrapheneOS once I installed Google Play services. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CommitSyn](user?id=CommitSyn) [8 months ago](item?id=40254484)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248658) | [prev](#40249387) | [next](#40248884) [–]  The only 'banking' app I've had not work on GrapheneOS is Cash App, but then I just go to the website and use the web UI. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nickburns](user?id=nickburns) [8 months ago](item?id=40248884)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248658) | [prev](#40254484) | [next](#40249144) [–]  there *is* (or at least can be) some risk tolerance within any so-called 'threat model.' but i absolutely take your point and agree with you. nary the case but i suppose if i absolutely *needed* to access any finances from my mobile device, it certainly wouldn't be from one of said institution's own mobile apps, but via web browser. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GTP](user?id=GTP) [8 months ago](item?id=40249507)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248884) | [next](#40249144) [–]  > i suppose if i absolutely needed to access any finances from my mobile device, it certainly wouldn't be from one of said institution's own mobile apps, but via web browser.

The device-local network (localhost) is also guarded by this permission, which is important for preventing apps from using it to communicate between profiles. Unlike a firewall-based implementation, the Network permission toggle prevents apps from using the network via APIs provided by the OS or other apps in the same profile as long as they're marked appropriately. >The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis. > To avoid breaking compatibility with Android apps, the added permission toggle is enabled by default. However, the OS app installation UI has been extended to show the toggle as part of the installation confirmation page so users can disable it when installing an app. > when the Network permission is disabled, GrapheneOS pretends the network is down. It shows the network as down in various APIs, returns errors showing a network connectivity issue rather than a revoked permission and avoids running scheduled jobs depending on the network. This results in apps handling it as if the network is down rather than crashing or showing errors from trying to use the network and being unable to do it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sureglymop](user?id=sureglymop) [8 months ago](item?id=40251417)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40249981) | [prev](#40250772) | [next](#40248438) [–]  Nope.

It's especially frustrating when using internal dns records that only live internal will randomly not work on a phone. I can see that the device is on wifi that is feeding internal dns servers with the records, but it's resolving externally still for some android reason.

This worked great to ensure that no traffic was leaked from pc to vpn server. The IP address of the VPN server you’re making use of rarely changes or if it does it’s easy enough to change on the MikroTik firewall. Another method is to block all traffic not to the port/protocol pair being used by the VPN server if you don’t know the servers IP address (or if it changes). As an example drop any traffic not dst UDP 1194 (based on the type of VPN, of course). MikroTik routers also have a great little tool called torch that allows you to quickly and easily watch traffic (in addition to of course, supporting packet captures.

One example they've brought up is that, with root, a single bug in the display server could lead to complete and immediate compromise of the entire device (assuming root access is gated by UI prompts as is common on most rooted ROMs). Additionally, with verified boot, persistent changes to the OS made via root would cause the phone to be unable to reboot, which limits what you can do with root (assuming you still want verified boot). GrapheneOS standards are much higher than on desktop Linux, where root can be acquired as easily as injecting a fake `sudo` into ~/.bashrc. Basically the idea is that there should be no need for root if everything is nicely gated by permission controls and high-level APIs. If every component of Android were actually well-designed, this idea would have more merit, but unfortunately there are still a few big gaps in what you can do with a rooted versus non-rooted device, e.g. custom firewall rules (which could provide a hotfix for the issue at hand here). When asked to expose more fine-grained firewall control to the end user, the Graphene devs basically responded that it's extremely difficult to set up firewall rules properly such that leaks are impossible [1], which may be true, but I'd like to think it's better than nothing. Also, because root access would break Android's protection against end user application tampering, that would likely rule out the possibility of GrapheneOS receiving special support from banking apps, which is something they hope to see in the future [2]. Anyway, this particular issue is definitely a bug in AOSP, and will hopefully be resolved promptly. It's being tracked here: <https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996> [1] <https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/4113/6> [2] [https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-gu...](https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [strcat](user?id=strcat) [8 months ago](item?id=40252827)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40251525) | [next](#40250983) [–]  It's app accessible root with a massive portion of the OS trusted with giving out access to it that's a huge problem and massively rolls back OS security against compromise. It also means an accessibility service can trivially escalate to root with no way to revoke it beyond reinstalling the OS or doing a wipe from recovery. You also lose the main security properties of verified boot, which is based around avoiding trust in persistent state. Raising the bar for physical attacks is a secondary purpose of verified boot, not the main one. GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this. It's not simply difficult to set up firewall rules where leaks aren't possible but rather it doesn't really work because not everything is done via direct socket access from the apps. This is why we have our Network toggle in the first place, which does a lot more than blocking direct socket access both to block indirect access and preserve compatibility by pretending the network is down for the most important APIs. These DNS leak issues which were reported to us earlier may be an app bug which can be worked around by the app. The OS could be changed to prevent this happening but that doesn't imply that it's an OS bug. More investigation is required to determine the cause and solution. We're also aware of a local network multicast leak that's not covered in Mullvad's post, which is very likely to be an Android OS bug but we aren't certain about that yet either. It's worth noting that neither the DNS leak issues or local network multicast leak issue impact the built-in VPN support. They're only happening with VPN apps. It's likely that some of this is caused by bugs in the Android VPN service app support (particularly the multicast packet leaks) but the DNS leaks are quite possibly an app flaw. Mullvad's post acknowledges they found a way to address one of the forms of leaks with changes to their app, which may be possible for the rest since there aren't leaks when the VPN is down but rather when it's in the process of reconnecting. It looks a lot like a race condition where the VPN is being activated before everything is in place, which could be a bug in the OS but could also be a bug in the app where it's doing something in a different order than what's intended. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [NotPractical](user?id=NotPractical) [8 months ago](item?id=40253467)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252827) | [next](#40250983) [–]  > GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this.

Maybe I should file an issue with the official WireGuard app asking them to support this. It would be nice if "multiple VPNs" was provided as an OS feature. Apps have to implement it unless you mean supporting multi-hop WireGuard VPNs within the OS. Apps can support multi-hop and apps can also support doing filtering, etc. in addition to supporting an actual VPN. It's not exclusive unless the apps make it exclusive. Apps can also decide they want to support forwarding traffic through another app but they should really do that in a way that's secure instead of how some apps are currently offering this... > This only applies to rules intended for specific apps and not system-wide rules, no? I'd hope so, since as you said people are already applying system-wide (or at least user-wide) rules using the VPN interface. Sure, but output filtering doesn't really work well in general. For example, if you allow resolving any DNS names then you allow 2 way communication with anyone through your DNS resolver. The requests only go to your DNS resolver, but they can be for <data>.<random>.example.com where the name servers for example.com are set up to receive that data and the random value avoids it being served from the resolver's cache. The value of the DNS result can return data in the other direction. It's easier with a TXT record but can simply be an A/AAAA record too. DNS is commonly used to mask traffic by malware. It's not an obscure approach but rather very normal. Similarly, many services can be used as some form of proxy at least to communicate with arbitrary people. The main purpose of a firewall is when you're actually hosting services and need to filter inbound connections for DDoS mitigation, etc. by limiting the number of connections per IP or IP block, rate limiting, etc. It also acts as a way to prevent listening on ports you didn't intend to be listening on due to default-enabled services or services which listen on all interfaces by default, etc. On platforms where loopback is commonly used for communication, it's also a way to do access control based on uid, gid, SELinux context, etc. None of those 3 things applies much to Android. It's very rare for apps to use loopback for communication, although some do it. Hopefully they already do their own authentication... GrapheneOS does plan to use network namespaces to provide the option of per-profile or per-app loopback interfaces, although we could also just start with a toggle for access to it. Worth noting Android uses eBPF for controlling per-app access to the network for our Network toggle, not netfilter (iptables/nftables). They've gradually moved more and more to eBPF and away from netfilter since they have the resources to develop things that way. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40250983)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40250160) | [prev](#40251525) | [next](#40248077) [–]  Anyone who prefers root access on Android with a locked bootloader (on the OSes that support it) can use avbroot: <https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot> Works great with CalyxOS and GrapheneOS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [strcat](user?id=strcat) [8 months ago](item?id=40252578)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40250983) | [next](#40252412) [–]  This doesn't work with GrapheneOS but rather you can create a derivative of GrapheneOS without the core security model intact. Instead of a tiny core portion of the OS being trusted with root access, a massive portion of the OS is trusted with that. It's much easier for an application to compromise the OS. An attacker doesn't need exploits for privileged persistent compromise anymore but rather that's a given since the verified boot security model is no longer intact. The purpose of locking the bootloader is enabling verified boot, which is no longer intact with this approach. CalyxOS doesn't have a complete verified boot implementation for the OS like GrapheneOS and rolls back the standard security model a fair bit, but doing this rolls it back far more. You cannot have your cake and eat it too in this case. If you want modifications to the OS, you should use the official build instructions and avoid replacing the core of the OS with a rootkit trusting a massive portion of the OS to give out root access and trusting persistent state with root access. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40254329)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252578) | [next](#40252412) [–]  avbroot is not officially supported by CalyxOS or GrapheneOS, but it does work with both OSes. The point of avbroot is to make root access available to trusted Android apps while leaving commands such as "fastboot flash" and "fastboot erase" disabled. There will always be a subset of users who prioritize functionality over security. This includes anyone who would root an Android device (and anyone who would use a desktop computer running most distributions of Linux, macOS, or Windows). I'll be glad to reconsider using root on Android if all of the functions of App Manager's "block trackers" feature[1] and Basic Call Recorder[2] were available on Android without root.

Similarly to if you build and signed the OS properly, you'll need to make each of the updates yourself. Unlike building and signing the OS properly, you will not have the basic security model intact but rather will be massively rolling back security and trusting a huge portion of the OS with root access. Giving root to a massive portion of the OS destroys the fine grained access control and isolation model used throughout the OS. It makes exploitation much easier to do and much easier to hide. It also makes persistence a given since persistent root access can be given out which means an attacker doesn't need any verified boot bypass anymore. It's odd to go through all this effort to continue signing the OS for verified boot while losing the main verified boot security model which makes it useful. If you want root access, build and sign userdebug builds with ro.adb.secure=1, which is officially supported by GrapheneOS and only exposes root access via ADB which you should only use from the computer where you're building the OS. It would be possible to add some kind of key combination at boot to disable loading user installed applications, etc. and instead making a terminal with root access available. Not clear how that's really useful though. Instead, what these projects are doing is giving out root access to a massive portion of the OS in order to be able to give out full root access to apps. This is used as a shortcut to implement features in a way that massively reduces security even if you never use it. Implementing those features properly integrated into the OS following the principle of least privilege is the proper approach. Most of the features people believe they need this hack to achieve are doable without it, such as filtering traffic with your own firewall rules while also using a VPN which is a standard Android feature available to apps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40254112)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252412) | [prev](#40252633) | [next](#40248077) [–]  No, over-the-air updates are not supported.

It's a vicious cycle, you have to design these mobile platforms for infants because that's the only way you can keep them safe, but they will never learn anything about computer or network technology using something designed to infantilize them. The thing is, it's not that I particularly care about people, but it's made Android/iOS incredibly irritating to use, I avoid it as much as I can. It's not just that it wants to protect me from myself, as much as it doesn't let me do what I want to do, it feels like computing with a straightjacket on.

We don't agree with how Mullvad is presenting this because it is not yet clear if the leaks with their app and other apps are because of bugs in these apps or the OS. Their own post says they've resolved part of these DNS leaks through changing their app to avoid not having a DNS configuration. Android supports many use cases of the VPN service API including not handling DNS and this may be a side effect of that flexibility. It's not necessarily a bug. If it's possible to set up the apps in a way that they don't leak without OS changes, then it was probably an app issue all along. We're aware of a separate issue unrelated to DNS leaks where multicast packets can leak to the local network with VPN apps. This appears to be an OS bug, but that's not confirmed yet. It will likely only be determined if it's a bug when we find a fix for it. This multicast leak doesn't happen with the built-in VPN support either. There have been plenty of VPN leaks on other platforms including issues that are still not really fixed without setting up custom netfilter or eBPF rules similar to what Android is trying to do on platforms where that's not done for you by the OS. On Android, the responsibility for preventing leaks is partially taken on by the OS which promotes a standard leak blocking feature which has gotten much better in the past few years. Each app trying to do this themselves is not a recipe for success. It's not as if Mullvad was aware of these issues for a long time and asking Android to fix it without action. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [badrabbit](user?id=badrabbit) [8 months ago](item?id=40248945)   | [prev](#40247982) | [next](#40248144) [–]  I gave on trusting phones to secure data a long time ago.

There are no known remote leaks on Android 14 when a VPN app supporting is already active or when it's down. The DNS leaks in this post were partially caused by an app bug that's not fixed and also happen when the VPN is in the process of connecting. The issue with leaks when the VPN is in the process of connecting may be an app bug or an OS bug. It's not clear that it's an OS bug at this point. It was reported to us for GrapheneOS earlier and we've been looking into it. There's also leak issue which was reported where multicast packets leak outside of the VPN tunnel to the local network. This is highly likely to be an OS bug, unlike the DNS leak issue where it's not yet clear if the OS or the app is the problem. The OS can likely prevent those DNS leaks even if apps don't get fixed but it wasn't necessarily supposed to be responsible for it. From the OS perspective, a VPN app is supposed to set a DNS configuration and not setting that configuration results in partially using the OS DNS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Valery91](user?id=Valery91) [8 months ago](item?id=40259218)   | [root](#40248051) | [parent](#40252866) | [next](#40248862) [–]  If you don't mind clarifying, currently GOS uses ASYMMETRIC MTE for the low overhead and to close the soft time constraint in ASYNC MODE. I was having a read though [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implem...](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implemented-part-1.html?m=1) Where I had come accross possible MTE bypasses in ASYNC mode and I quote: 'Since SIGSEGV is a catchable signal, any signal handlers that can handle SIGSEGV become a critical attack surface for async MTE bypasses'. Moreover, "The concept is simple - if we can corrupt any state that would result in the signal handler concluding that a SIGSEGV coming from a tag-check failure is handled/safe, then we can effectively disable MTE for the process", hence having MTE as ineffective. Paradoxically, I don't believe this issue is faced regarding SYNC MODE. As you obviously know, 'in asymmetric mode, read memory accesses are processed as SYNC, while write memory accesses are processed as ASYNC'. does this mean that the signal handlers in write memory are exploitable? If this be true, does GOS offer a mitigation for this, or can it be possible to simply allow all users to have the option to pick SYNC MTE to bypass this attack surface? Furthermore, MTE is not enabled for the kernel, would it be possible to have it enabled by choice as well? Finally, regarding the OS processes to which GOS recently enabled MTE for as an option for its users, does it also include the cellular firmware, IOMMU/SMMU and the software stack that communicates between the isolated chip and the OS? I address this point because, GAL Beniamini stated that: " That said, up until now we’ve only considered the high-level attack surface exposed to the firmware. In effect, we were thinking of the Wi-Fi SoC and the application processor as two distinct entities which are completely isolated from one another. In reality, we know that nothing can be further from the truth. Not only are the Wi-Fi SoC and the host physically proximate to one another, they also share a physical communication interface". Nonetheless he further states: "For example, by going over the IOMMU bindings in the Linux Kernel, we can see that apparently both Qualcomm and Samsung have their own proprietary implementations of an SMMU (!), with it’s own unique device-tree bindings. However, suspiciously, it seems that the device tree entries for the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip are missing these IOMMU bindings". Despite that the research is from a couple years, it remains viable evidence that IOMMU although provides adequate protection, it remains an insufficient mechanism on its own and requires further hardening on the software stack. Does GOS address this profound attack vector? I hope to get your perspective on the matter.

It doesn't have to be Mullvad but it's almost guaranteed based on what we've seen in the history (see CIA + swiss crypto company) that some of the major VPN providers are managed by intelligence agencies.

I mean, duh. Like everyone always says around here, all bets are off when your threat model includes nation states. Timing attacks, meta data, and total access to the internet backbones means it’s a reasonable bet that the Big Boys can track anything on the public internet, regardless of encryption or redirection. And if you’re Hamas, you’re probably on their radar. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [spxneo](user?id=spxneo) [8 months ago](item?id=40251329)   | [root](#40251233) | [parent](#40251273) | [next](#40249878) [–]  So your narrative is that they have complete access but choose not to act on anything they find on VPNs and other "privacy focused" tech?

If they are not a state actor, then the goal would be to be so private that if terrorists use it, nobody would ever know including themselves. In both cases, we see the same result as the public until somebody leaks. This means that you would be very unlikely to get busted using a state compromised VPN for torrenting movies, as that's typically a civil matter and would require additional data points for parallel construction to not reveal the compromised VPN. But if you are involved in terrorism, then you should assume the VPN is compromised in a way that will make digging up additional secrets about your activities trivial and attributable to something besides the VPN that everyone is fine with (like dragnet service provider data). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [anonymousab](user?id=anonymousab) [8 months ago](item?id=40253243)   | [root](#40251233) | [parent](#40251329) | [prev](#40253226) | [next](#40252016) [–]  > but choose not to act on anything they find on VPNs and other "privacy focused" tech? Oh, they probably do act on it. For most things, I assume they use the intelligence they gather for parallel construction - if you know a fact about an adversary, it can make it easier to find other, more obvious (to that adversary) ways to "find" that information. I'd imagine taking direct, obvious action on information gleaned from front and honeypot VPN services is probably only done for extreme cases i.e. an active threat to the country/administration/agency/allies. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [generalizations](user?id=generalizations) [8 months ago](item?id=40252016)   | [root](#40251233) | [parent](#40251329) | [prev](#40253243) | [next](#40251914) [–]  What’s not to understand?

Yes, there are other methods of fingerprinting that can track your with varying degrees of accuracy that you should be aware of. But IP still remains a highly effective one.

In many instances it will be better to share an IP with all the other VPN customers. EDIT: Also, without this leak, Android API "VPNs" can actually distinguish traffic of individual apps, acting as a firewall that blocks untrusted apps from sending your data somewhere else. With a DNS leak, they can exfiltrate data through it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xTJ](user?id=0xTJ) [8 months ago](item?id=40247926)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247846) | [next](#40247922) [–]  Just changing your IP address is *far* from the only reason to use a VPN.
