# DNS traffic can leak outside the VPN tunnel on Android

May 3, 2024 [Privacy](/en/blog/tag/privacy)Â [App](/en/blog/tag/app)Â

We were recently made aware of multiple potential DNS leaks on Android. They stem from bugs in Android itself, and only affect certain apps.

On Monday 22 of April we became aware of a [user report on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mullvadvpn/comments/1c9p96y/dns_leak_with_block_connections_without_vpn_on/) of a [DNS leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_leak). The report detailed how the user managed to leak DNS queries when disabling and enabling VPN while having “Block connections without VPN” on. We immediately started an internal investigation that could confirm the issue. The investigation also led to more findings of scenarios that can cause DNS leaks on Android.

### Findings

Identified scenarios where the Android OS can leak DNS traffic:

* If a VPN is active without any DNS server configured.
* For a short period of time while a VPN app is re-configuring the tunnel or is being force stopped/crashes.

The leaks seem to be limited to direct calls to the C function `getaddrinfo`. Apps that use this way to resolve domain names cause leaks in the scenarios listed above. We have not found any leaks from apps that only use Android API:s such as [DnsResolver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/DnsResolver). The Chrome browser is an example of an app that can use `getaddrinfo` [directly](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/%2B/main%3Aandroid_webview/browser/aw_pac_processor.cc;l=197;drc=133b2d903fa57cfda1317bc589b349cf4c284b7c).

The above applies regardless of whether *Always-on VPN* and *Block connections without VPN* is enabled or not, which is not expected OS behavior and should therefore be fixed upstream in the OS.

We’ve been able to confirm that these leaks occur in multiple versions of Android, including the latest version (Android 14).

### Improvements

Our app currently does not set any DNS server in its blocking state. When our app fails to set up a tunnel in a way that is not recoverable, it enters the blocking state. In this state it stops traffic from leaving the device. However, it does not set any DNS server in this state, and as a result the above described DNS leaks can happen. We will work around the OS bug by setting a bogus DNS server for now. You can expect a release with this fix soon.

The leak during tunnel reconnects is harder for us to mitigate in our app. We are still looking for solutions. We can potentially minimize the amount of times a tunnel re-configuration happens, but we currently don’t think this leak can be fully prevented.

It should be made clear that these workarounds should not be needed in any VPN app. Nor is it wrong for an app to use `getaddrinfo` to resolve domain names. Instead, these issues should be addressed in the OS in order to protect all Android users regardless of which apps they use.

We have reported [the issues and suggested improvements](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996) to Google and hope that they will address this quickly.

### Steps to reproduce

The following steps reproduce the second scenario above, where a VPN user changes the tunnel configuration, e.g. switching to another server or changing DNS server.

Here we use the WireGuard app since it has become a reference Android VPN implementation. It should be noted that the leaks can probably be reproduced with any other Android VPN app also. We use Chrome to trigger the leaks since it is one of the apps we have confirmed uses `getaddrinfo`.

1. Download [spam\_get\_requests.html](/media/uploads/2024/05/03/spam_get_requests.html)
2. Install the WireGuard app & Chrome
3. Import [wg1.conf](/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg1.conf), [wg2.conf](/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg2.conf) into WireGuard
4. Enable the wg1 tunnel in the WireGuard app and allow the VPN permission
5. In Android VPN Settings enable “Always-on VPN” & “Block connections without VPN” for WireGuard
6. Start capturing data on your router by using e.g `tcpdump`
   `$ tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> host <IP of android device>`
7. Split the screen to show both WireGuard & Chrome side by side
8. Open `spam_get_requests.html` with Chrome & press “Start”
9. Toggle back and fourth between wg1 and wg2 in the WireGuard app until you see the leaks in the next step.
10. Observe DNS traffic similar to this on the router:
    ```
    11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 11200+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19282-11-50-27-519z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)
    11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 44347+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19284-11-50-27-579z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)
    11:50:27.816396 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 44584+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19289-11-50-27-729z.mullvad.test. (61)
    11:50:27.816458 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 > Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353: 11200 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)
    11:50:27.816476 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.45727 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 40503+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19290-11-50-27-759z.mullvad.test. (61)
    11:50:27.816542 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 > Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267: 44347 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)
    11:50:27.816588 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.43821 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 36295+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19291-11-50-27-789z.mullvad.test. (61)
    11:50:27.816625 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 > Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747: 44584 NXDomain 0/0/0 (61)
    ```

Since “Block connections without VPN” was active, nothing except encrypted WireGuard traffic should have left the device, but here we see plaintext DNS leaving the device.

### Conclusions and recommendations

DNS leaks may have serious privacy implications for users, and can be used to derive users' approximate location or find out what websites and services a user uses.

These finding also shows once again that “Block connections without VPN” does not live up to its name (or documentation) and that it has multiple flaws. Apps may still leak DNS traffic during the conditions mentioned above, and as [previously reported](/en/blog/android-leaks-connectivity-check-traffic) it still leaks connection check traffic.

Depending on your threat model this might mean that you should avoid using Android altogether for anything sensitive, or employ other mitigations to prevent the leaks. We aim to partially mitigate these problems in our app, so make sure to keep the app up-to-date.

I initially had mixed feelings about it as well. On the other hand the campaign we did in Stockholm last year worked out quite well. It managed to affect both domestic and EU legislative discussions at the time. Or at least our campaign contributed to moving the discussion in the right direction. How much is that worth? I'm not sure, but the reason we started Mullvad in the first place was to conduct political action through entrepreneurship, specifically regarding mass surveillance and censorship. If nothing else it seems to amuse a lot of people, including me and my colleagues.

I am definitely part of the HN group think that tends to be irked by mass marketing- mainly because of baggage from the past of false advertising.

I can't speak for my marketing colleagues but I would assume they reason about it. It seems like a complex system to me, which means the approach kind of has to be (1) forming an understanding of the system and (2) deciding whether one is comfortable with the uncertainty. One aspect that makes the cost/benefit assessment quite a bit easier is that we don't only care about how many new paying customers we get. It's also fun to do this kind of advertisement.

Billboard advertisements are an awareness type of advertisement. I'd be much more concerned to learn about paid endorsements, which they document on their website that they specifically do not do. Endorsements are a much more sensitive form of advertising, where once money trades hands for an endorsement, it stops being a useful third party assessment and starts being an advertisement disguised as a third party assessment. Awareness advertisements just make good business sense, so I'm genuinely curious why those would shy anybody away. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [int\_19h](user?id=int_19h) [8 months ago](item?id=40251269)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40250222) | [next](#40250348) [–]  I agree with you, but I also understand where GP is coming from.

Mullvad itself is extremely clear that use of a VPN alone is not enough for the reasons you stated. Mullvad VPN (which is what they advertised) is a suite of products and services, some of which are: - DNS services (ads, tracking) - A privacy-optimized browser (cookies, fingerprinting) - Network services like multihop routing (many benefits such as resistance to timing attacks) All of these services are included with your subscription at no additional cost.

It's just a bulk pile of cards, Amazon records you bought one but doesn't know which one (and the actual code is under a scratch-to-reveal surface). Even if a three-letter agency intercepted your package and swapped your gift card with a known code, I believe Mullvad is not recording the connection between specific gift code and the account number.

We launched Mullvad 15 years ago. During those 15 years people's interest and awareness of online security and privacy has grown considerably, as has the consumer VPN market. 2. Our strategy is quite different from most of our competitors'. As a result we've grown slower than several of them, but we have nevertheless continued to grow year after year. 3. The costs of the campaign are perhaps lower than you assume. tl;dr We've slowly grown over many years and are now making enough money to plaster privacy propaganda over your city.

If you do take their word for how they run their systems (/are working toward), their servers are diskless (what logs?), will only run software signed by their infrastructure team, and will remotely attest that their software has not been tampered with. This is so very, very, far away from the typical VPN company that any such comparison sounds ridiculous to me.

As the DNS server operator, you can view all my DNS queries. In a zero-trust environment where I don't trust you not to log all user queries and forwards them to the NSA, you'd need to use homomorphic encryption and create a DNS client and server than can do a lookup, without you, the DNS server operator, from finding out what the DNS lookup was of. <https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs> claims to have implemented this at a level that's practical for real world applications, with a demo for a wikipedia server, but it's far too slow, as demoed, for use as DNS server. Now, the fact of the matter is that you can map my account ID back to the IP I'm connecting from, but with very limited way to map from my IP to my identity protects that in many ways, but data-mining at scale, knowing how many users connecting to one proxy server from city X, would be worth something to advertising and related companies who are more interested in large habits of users. If it turns out no one uses the pirate bay anymore, but use torrent site XYZ, I know where I'd place my advertising dollars for, say, a VPN product. This is on the extreme end, but you asked for a fun challenge! :) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kfreds](user?id=kfreds) [8 months ago](item?id=40252475)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40251774) | [next](#40254254) [–]  Thanks! :) I should've been more clear.

And I'm, like, half okay with that - it's entirely justified paranoia, bad actors of all skill levels undeniably exist and they hide successfully for many years, but I do believe good actors exist. It's why I chose mullvad. At best you have stuff like attestation... but we all know those have a long history of being flawed and are subject to loads of side channels that can't be attested against. Plus VPNs are such a honeypot in every conceivable way that TONS of state-actor-level efforts are entirely reasonable, and that could easily include cheating on basically all attestation systems imaginable. We're just kinda stuck trusting history and lack of public leaks / correlated actions / whistleblowers IMO. Or, frankly, the Mozilla partnering counts for a lot to me. I won't use their setup because it doesn't have non-vpn-app options, but they're a group I mostly trust to have people's safety at heart. Personally, stuff like Tor (where by construction you only need to touch a couple good actors to be reasonably secure, and anyone can contribute) is about the only mostly-actually-trustworthy kind of system. You can *expect* malicious actors to participate there, and still have a reasonable level of privacy, particularly if you check a few personally (which is feasible because anyone can contribute). Tor and similar have plenty of issues, but structurally they're much more sound by design than any centralized VPN can ever be. Now if only they were even a tiny fraction as usable... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [reaperman](user?id=reaperman) [8 months ago](item?id=40248340)   | [root](#40247762) | [parent](#40248249) | [prev](#40250266) | [next](#40251577) [–]  I think legally they would have to change their ownership directive document in Switzerland to allow the board of directors to allow the two founders to sell more than 50% of their shares.

I think this demonstrates some support, at least in the way that increased traffic/usage can be support (and should help make Mullvad VPN users stand out less WRT DNS requests). The only downside I'll say is that the ping time for me is quite a bit higher than quad9 or cloudflare.

As far as I know there is no official flashlight app (though recently there is a built in flashlight feature). How is Google responsible for a third party app that refuses to work without an internet access? GP is saying that the Android permissions model requires giving Internet access to any app you install from the Play Store; there isn't a way for an app to request "zero permissions" (or rather, there is, but basic Internet access is a permission granted to all apps, even when zero additional entitlements are requested). That said, this isn't unique to Android. At least as of a few years ago, iOS did more or less the same thing. (You can disable an app's access to the *local* network, but that's not the same thing as denying (or requiring an app to request) basic network connectivity). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [toast0](user?id=toast0) [8 months ago](item?id=40248789)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40248404) | [next](#40248500) [–]  Google doesn't let you deny permissions for most of them.

Another guy did make a unofficial LOS for it though. Custom ROMs nowadays require you to be scouring Qualcomm out of tree source repositories (or firmware dumps of equivalent phones, I think, in the case of Mediatek). It's impossible to guarantee quality with this conditions. Even if you just want to have a pristine kernel tree of the original firmware you may find, if it was ever released, it was squashed on the wrong source commit (again, laurel\_sprout, though a random Github angel fixed it). So Google's devices tend, thankfully, to have better sources. Additionally, GOS team is competent and, for now, sustained full-time by donations. Those three conditions are what allow GOS to be a very good ROM.

The device-local network (localhost) is also guarded by this permission, which is important for preventing apps from using it to communicate between profiles. Unlike a firewall-based implementation, the Network permission toggle prevents apps from using the network via APIs provided by the OS or other apps in the same profile as long as they're marked appropriately. >The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis. > To avoid breaking compatibility with Android apps, the added permission toggle is enabled by default. However, the OS app installation UI has been extended to show the toggle as part of the installation confirmation page so users can disable it when installing an app. > when the Network permission is disabled, GrapheneOS pretends the network is down. It shows the network as down in various APIs, returns errors showing a network connectivity issue rather than a revoked permission and avoids running scheduled jobs depending on the network. This results in apps handling it as if the network is down rather than crashing or showing errors from trying to use the network and being unable to do it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sureglymop](user?id=sureglymop) [8 months ago](item?id=40251417)   | [root](#40247917) | [parent](#40249981) | [prev](#40250772) | [next](#40248438) [–]  Nope.

I've observed adb debugs for times recently to see why/when wireless was disconnecting, and it comes down to liveliness checks that if it can't see or resolve something, it'll simply bring up and try the cell data to do so. It's especially frustrating when using internal dns records that only live internal will randomly not work on a phone. I can see that the device is on wifi that is feeding internal dns servers with the records, but it's resolving externally still for some android reason.

He’s obviously not a web dev and the jailbreak scene is kind of scrappy so I can forgive the website. Look past the formatting and see what’s there.

This worked great to ensure that no traffic was leaked from pc to vpn server. The IP address of the VPN server you’re making use of rarely changes or if it does it’s easy enough to change on the MikroTik firewall. Another method is to block all traffic not to the port/protocol pair being used by the VPN server if you don’t know the servers IP address (or if it changes). As an example drop any traffic not dst UDP 1194 (based on the type of VPN, of course). MikroTik routers also have a great little tool called torch that allows you to quickly and easily watch traffic (in addition to of course, supporting packet captures.

Using Magisk massively rolls back the OS security model and is strongly discouraged. Using ADB on a production device isn't recommended with or without root, but it's officially supported if you want to do it. If you only grant ADB access to the computer you use for building and signing the OS, it's not a big deal.

One example they've brought up is that, with root, a single bug in the display server could lead to complete and immediate compromise of the entire device (assuming root access is gated by UI prompts as is common on most rooted ROMs). Additionally, with verified boot, persistent changes to the OS made via root would cause the phone to be unable to reboot, which limits what you can do with root (assuming you still want verified boot). GrapheneOS standards are much higher than on desktop Linux, where root can be acquired as easily as injecting a fake `sudo` into ~/.bashrc. Basically the idea is that there should be no need for root if everything is nicely gated by permission controls and high-level APIs. If every component of Android were actually well-designed, this idea would have more merit, but unfortunately there are still a few big gaps in what you can do with a rooted versus non-rooted device, e.g. custom firewall rules (which could provide a hotfix for the issue at hand here). When asked to expose more fine-grained firewall control to the end user, the Graphene devs basically responded that it's extremely difficult to set up firewall rules properly such that leaks are impossible [1], which may be true, but I'd like to think it's better than nothing. Also, because root access would break Android's protection against end user application tampering, that would likely rule out the possibility of GrapheneOS receiving special support from banking apps, which is something they hope to see in the future [2]. Anyway, this particular issue is definitely a bug in AOSP, and will hopefully be resolved promptly. It's being tracked here: <https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996> [1] <https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/4113/6> [2] [https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-gu...](https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [strcat](user?id=strcat) [8 months ago](item?id=40252827)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40251525) | [next](#40250983) [–]  It's app accessible root with a massive portion of the OS trusted with giving out access to it that's a huge problem and massively rolls back OS security against compromise. It also means an accessibility service can trivially escalate to root with no way to revoke it beyond reinstalling the OS or doing a wipe from recovery. You also lose the main security properties of verified boot, which is based around avoiding trust in persistent state. Raising the bar for physical attacks is a secondary purpose of verified boot, not the main one. GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this. It's not simply difficult to set up firewall rules where leaks aren't possible but rather it doesn't really work because not everything is done via direct socket access from the apps. This is why we have our Network toggle in the first place, which does a lot more than blocking direct socket access both to block indirect access and preserve compatibility by pretending the network is down for the most important APIs. These DNS leak issues which were reported to us earlier may be an app bug which can be worked around by the app. The OS could be changed to prevent this happening but that doesn't imply that it's an OS bug. More investigation is required to determine the cause and solution. We're also aware of a local network multicast leak that's not covered in Mullvad's post, which is very likely to be an Android OS bug but we aren't certain about that yet either. It's worth noting that neither the DNS leak issues or local network multicast leak issue impact the built-in VPN support. They're only happening with VPN apps. It's likely that some of this is caused by bugs in the Android VPN service app support (particularly the multicast packet leaks) but the DNS leaks are quite possibly an app flaw. Mullvad's post acknowledges they found a way to address one of the forms of leaks with changes to their app, which may be possible for the rest since there aren't leaks when the VPN is down but rather when it's in the process of reconnecting. It looks a lot like a race condition where the VPN is being activated before everything is in place, which could be a bug in the OS but could also be a bug in the app where it's doing something in a different order than what's intended. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [NotPractical](user?id=NotPractical) [8 months ago](item?id=40253467)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252827) | [next](#40250983) [–]  > GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this.

Maybe I should file an issue with the official WireGuard app asking them to support this. It would be nice if "multiple VPNs" was provided as an OS feature. Apps have to implement it unless you mean supporting multi-hop WireGuard VPNs within the OS. Apps can support multi-hop and apps can also support doing filtering, etc. in addition to supporting an actual VPN. It's not exclusive unless the apps make it exclusive. Apps can also decide they want to support forwarding traffic through another app but they should really do that in a way that's secure instead of how some apps are currently offering this... > This only applies to rules intended for specific apps and not system-wide rules, no? I'd hope so, since as you said people are already applying system-wide (or at least user-wide) rules using the VPN interface. Sure, but output filtering doesn't really work well in general. For example, if you allow resolving any DNS names then you allow 2 way communication with anyone through your DNS resolver. The requests only go to your DNS resolver, but they can be for <data>.<random>.example.com where the name servers for example.com are set up to receive that data and the random value avoids it being served from the resolver's cache. The value of the DNS result can return data in the other direction. It's easier with a TXT record but can simply be an A/AAAA record too. DNS is commonly used to mask traffic by malware. It's not an obscure approach but rather very normal. Similarly, many services can be used as some form of proxy at least to communicate with arbitrary people. The main purpose of a firewall is when you're actually hosting services and need to filter inbound connections for DDoS mitigation, etc. by limiting the number of connections per IP or IP block, rate limiting, etc. It also acts as a way to prevent listening on ports you didn't intend to be listening on due to default-enabled services or services which listen on all interfaces by default, etc. On platforms where loopback is commonly used for communication, it's also a way to do access control based on uid, gid, SELinux context, etc. None of those 3 things applies much to Android. It's very rare for apps to use loopback for communication, although some do it. Hopefully they already do their own authentication... GrapheneOS does plan to use network namespaces to provide the option of per-profile or per-app loopback interfaces, although we could also just start with a toggle for access to it. Worth noting Android uses eBPF for controlling per-app access to the network for our Network toggle, not netfilter (iptables/nftables). They've gradually moved more and more to eBPF and away from netfilter since they have the resources to develop things that way. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40250983)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40250160) | [prev](#40251525) | [next](#40248077) [–]  Anyone who prefers root access on Android with a locked bootloader (on the OSes that support it) can use avbroot: <https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot> Works great with CalyxOS and GrapheneOS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [strcat](user?id=strcat) [8 months ago](item?id=40252578)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40250983) | [next](#40252412) [–]  This doesn't work with GrapheneOS but rather you can create a derivative of GrapheneOS without the core security model intact. Instead of a tiny core portion of the OS being trusted with root access, a massive portion of the OS is trusted with that. It's much easier for an application to compromise the OS. An attacker doesn't need exploits for privileged persistent compromise anymore but rather that's a given since the verified boot security model is no longer intact. The purpose of locking the bootloader is enabling verified boot, which is no longer intact with this approach. CalyxOS doesn't have a complete verified boot implementation for the OS like GrapheneOS and rolls back the standard security model a fair bit, but doing this rolls it back far more. You cannot have your cake and eat it too in this case. If you want modifications to the OS, you should use the official build instructions and avoid replacing the core of the OS with a rootkit trusting a massive portion of the OS to give out root access and trusting persistent state with root access. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40254329)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252578) | [next](#40252412) [–]  avbroot is not officially supported by CalyxOS or GrapheneOS, but it does work with both OSes. The point of avbroot is to make root access available to trusted Android apps while leaving commands such as "fastboot flash" and "fastboot erase" disabled. There will always be a subset of users who prioritize functionality over security. This includes anyone who would root an Android device (and anyone who would use a desktop computer running most distributions of Linux, macOS, or Windows). I'll be glad to reconsider using root on Android if all of the functions of App Manager's "block trackers" feature[1] and Basic Call Recorder[2] were available on Android without root.

Similarly to if you build and signed the OS properly, you'll need to make each of the updates yourself. Unlike building and signing the OS properly, you will not have the basic security model intact but rather will be massively rolling back security and trusting a huge portion of the OS with root access. Giving root to a massive portion of the OS destroys the fine grained access control and isolation model used throughout the OS. It makes exploitation much easier to do and much easier to hide. It also makes persistence a given since persistent root access can be given out which means an attacker doesn't need any verified boot bypass anymore. It's odd to go through all this effort to continue signing the OS for verified boot while losing the main verified boot security model which makes it useful. If you want root access, build and sign userdebug builds with ro.adb.secure=1, which is officially supported by GrapheneOS and only exposes root access via ADB which you should only use from the computer where you're building the OS. It would be possible to add some kind of key combination at boot to disable loading user installed applications, etc. and instead making a terminal with root access available. Not clear how that's really useful though. Instead, what these projects are doing is giving out root access to a massive portion of the OS in order to be able to give out full root access to apps. This is used as a shortcut to implement features in a way that massively reduces security even if you never use it. Implementing those features properly integrated into the OS following the principle of least privilege is the proper approach. Most of the features people believe they need this hack to achieve are doable without it, such as filtering traffic with your own firewall rules while also using a VPN which is a standard Android feature available to apps. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [commoner](user?id=commoner) [8 months ago](item?id=40254112)   | [root](#40248020) | [parent](#40252412) | [prev](#40252633) | [next](#40248077) [–]  No, over-the-air updates are not supported.

I don't think there is a clear way to fix this on Android without breaking a lot of expected functionalty. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nickburns](user?id=nickburns) [8 months ago](item?id=40248831)   | [parent](#40248699) | [next](#40250356) [–]  ironically SMS/MMS and VVS are two of *maybe* a few other operations/functions (system updates maybe? *maybe*?) that are justifiably 'hard-coded' to the carrier connection. i've done the dance re: VVS with advanced AT&T support on VPN'ed iOS—so can confirm your point is not limited to Android. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bestham](user?id=bestham) [8 months ago](item?id=40250356)   | [parent](#40248699) | [prev](#40248831) | [next](#40248779) [–]  No VoLTE uses a dedicated bearer (network interface) in the LTE stack.

We don't agree with how Mullvad is presenting this because it is not yet clear if the leaks with their app and other apps are because of bugs in these apps or the OS. Their own post says they've resolved part of these DNS leaks through changing their app to avoid not having a DNS configuration. Android supports many use cases of the VPN service API including not handling DNS and this may be a side effect of that flexibility. It's not necessarily a bug. If it's possible to set up the apps in a way that they don't leak without OS changes, then it was probably an app issue all along. We're aware of a separate issue unrelated to DNS leaks where multicast packets can leak to the local network with VPN apps. This appears to be an OS bug, but that's not confirmed yet. It will likely only be determined if it's a bug when we find a fix for it. This multicast leak doesn't happen with the built-in VPN support either. There have been plenty of VPN leaks on other platforms including issues that are still not really fixed without setting up custom netfilter or eBPF rules similar to what Android is trying to do on platforms where that's not done for you by the OS. On Android, the responsibility for preventing leaks is partially taken on by the OS which promotes a standard leak blocking feature which has gotten much better in the past few years. Each app trying to do this themselves is not a recipe for success. It's not as if Mullvad was aware of these issues for a long time and asking Android to fix it without action. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [badrabbit](user?id=badrabbit) [8 months ago](item?id=40248945)   | [prev](#40247982) | [next](#40248144) [–]  I gave on trusting phones to secure data a long time ago.

There are no known remote leaks on Android 14 when a VPN app supporting is already active or when it's down. The DNS leaks in this post were partially caused by an app bug that's not fixed and also happen when the VPN is in the process of connecting. The issue with leaks when the VPN is in the process of connecting may be an app bug or an OS bug. It's not clear that it's an OS bug at this point. It was reported to us for GrapheneOS earlier and we've been looking into it. There's also leak issue which was reported where multicast packets leak outside of the VPN tunnel to the local network. This is highly likely to be an OS bug, unlike the DNS leak issue where it's not yet clear if the OS or the app is the problem. The OS can likely prevent those DNS leaks even if apps don't get fixed but it wasn't necessarily supposed to be responsible for it. From the OS perspective, a VPN app is supposed to set a DNS configuration and not setting that configuration results in partially using the OS DNS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Valery91](user?id=Valery91) [8 months ago](item?id=40259218)   | [root](#40248051) | [parent](#40252866) | [next](#40248862) [–]  If you don't mind clarifying, currently GOS uses ASYMMETRIC MTE for the low overhead and to close the soft time constraint in ASYNC MODE. I was having a read though [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implem...](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implemented-part-1.html?m=1) Where I had come accross possible MTE bypasses in ASYNC mode and I quote: 'Since SIGSEGV is a catchable signal, any signal handlers that can handle SIGSEGV become a critical attack surface for async MTE bypasses'. Moreover, "The concept is simple - if we can corrupt any state that would result in the signal handler concluding that a SIGSEGV coming from a tag-check failure is handled/safe, then we can effectively disable MTE for the process", hence having MTE as ineffective. Paradoxically, I don't believe this issue is faced regarding SYNC MODE. As you obviously know, 'in asymmetric mode, read memory accesses are processed as SYNC, while write memory accesses are processed as ASYNC'. does this mean that the signal handlers in write memory are exploitable? If this be true, does GOS offer a mitigation for this, or can it be possible to simply allow all users to have the option to pick SYNC MTE to bypass this attack surface? Furthermore, MTE is not enabled for the kernel, would it be possible to have it enabled by choice as well? Finally, regarding the OS processes to which GOS recently enabled MTE for as an option for its users, does it also include the cellular firmware, IOMMU/SMMU and the software stack that communicates between the isolated chip and the OS? I address this point because, GAL Beniamini stated that: " That said, up until now we’ve only considered the high-level attack surface exposed to the firmware. In effect, we were thinking of the Wi-Fi SoC and the application processor as two distinct entities which are completely isolated from one another. In reality, we know that nothing can be further from the truth. Not only are the Wi-Fi SoC and the host physically proximate to one another, they also share a physical communication interface". Nonetheless he further states: "For example, by going over the IOMMU bindings in the Linux Kernel, we can see that apparently both Qualcomm and Samsung have their own proprietary implementations of an SMMU (!), with it’s own unique device-tree bindings. However, suspiciously, it seems that the device tree entries for the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip are missing these IOMMU bindings". Despite that the research is from a couple years, it remains viable evidence that IOMMU although provides adequate protection, it remains an insufficient mechanism on its own and requires further hardening on the software stack. Does GOS address this profound attack vector? I hope to get your perspective on the matter.

In both cases, we see the same result as the public until somebody leaks. This means that you would be very unlikely to get busted using a state compromised VPN for torrenting movies, as that's typically a civil matter and would require additional data points for parallel construction to not reveal the compromised VPN.

Just wish they used less shitty providers - all of them are super dodgy from xtom (super unhinged owner) to m247.

If feels like saying there is no reason to wear just a helmet in outer space because you'll die without a space suit anyway. Yes, there are other methods of fingerprinting that can track your with varying degrees of accuracy that you should be aware of. But IP still remains a highly effective one. And just like the space helmet, it isn't an either or. You'll have to wear both the suit and the helmet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tiagod](user?id=tiagod) [8 months ago](item?id=40247846)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247943) | [next](#40247926) [–]  That depends a lot on your threat model. In many instances it will be better to share an IP with all the other VPN customers. EDIT: Also, without this leak, Android API "VPNs" can actually distinguish traffic of individual apps, acting as a firewall that blocks untrusted apps from sending your data somewhere else. With a DNS leak, they can exfiltrate data through it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xTJ](user?id=0xTJ) [8 months ago](item?id=40247926)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247846) | [next](#40247922) [–]  Just changing your IP address is *far* from the only reason to use a VPN. Personally, I'd consider it more of a secondary effect. If you're on an untrusted network, it lets you pipe your data out to another location. I'm not sure what the point of your comment is, since it doesn't apply to the information in the shared post. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GrantMoyer](user?id=GrantMoyer) [8 months ago](item?id=40247922)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247926) | [next](#40247966) [–]  I use a (self hosted) vpn for privacy from public wifi operators, not for privacy from the servers I'm connecting to. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xcde4c3db](user?id=0xcde4c3db) [8 months ago](item?id=40247966)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247922) | [next](#40247835) [–]  Maybe they could be more forceful about it, but I feel like Mullvad is reasonably responsible about this (certainly more so than most VPN vendors), with their front page describing a VPN as "step 1" and directly saying that "a VPN is not enough for privacy". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ibizaman](user?id=ibizaman) [8 months ago](item?id=40247835)   | [parent](#40247786) | [prev](#40247966) | [next](#40248011) [–]  It does because on the server you can’t distinguish the IPs from different clients anymore. But indeed, you have other means of tracking. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chadsix](user?id=chadsix) [8 months ago](item?id=40247863)   | [root](#40247786) | [parent](#40247835) | [next](#40248011) [–]  I agree, but IP addresses haven't been used as the main source of tracking for some time. Advertisers learned how to use much better data points a long time ago due to AOL proxies much like the Mobile proxies a significant amount of mobile providers use today. > Depending on your threat model this might mean that you should avoid using Android altogether for anything sensitive, or employ other mitigations to prevent the leaks. We aim to partially mitigate these problems in our app, so make sure to keep the app up-to-date. I don't think companies should give false hopes to people, and that is what is exactly happening here (e.g., "fixing a DNS leak will make you private and that's the only reason you're not!"). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tiagod](user?id=tiagod) [8 months ago](item?id=40247903)   | [root](#40247786) | [parent](#40247863) | [next](#40247900) [–]  I agree with what you're saying, but I don't believe Mullvad push that narrative. In the article, they warn that "DNS leaks may have serious privacy implications for users". Looking at their marketing homepage, they say "Using a VPN alone is not enough to achieve perfect privacy. There’s simply too much data being extracted through most browsers." They also have this expansive analysis of the major threats to internet privacy: [https://mullvad.net/en/why-privacy-matters/how-mass-surveill...](https://mullvad.net/en/why-privacy-matters/how-mass-surveillance-companies-collect-your-data) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chadsix](user?id=chadsix) [8 months ago](item?id=40247985)   | [root](#40247786) | [parent](#40247903) | [next](#40247900) [–]  I read the threats page, and it covered some of the most glaring topics.

Several times actually. You should browse their literature more thoroughly. Mullvad is not an internet service provider. "[...] we, as a VPN service provider are not regarded as an electronic communications network nor an electronic communications service."

# Changelog

All changes to the software that can be noticed from the users' perspective should have an entry in
this file. Except very minor things that will not affect functionality, such as log message changes
and minor GUI adjustments.

### Format

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Entries should have the imperative form, just like commit messages. Start each entry with words like
add, fix, increase, force etc.. Not added, fixed, increased, forced etc.

Line wrap the file at 100 chars. That is over here -> |

### Categories each change fall into

* **Added**: for new features.
* **Changed**: for changes in existing functionality.
* **Deprecated**: for soon-to-be removed features.
* **Removed**: for now removed features.
* **Fixed**: for any bug fixes.
* **Security**: in case of vulnerabilities.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Windows

* Add support for Windows ARM64.

### Changed

* (Linux and macOS only) Update to DAITA v2. The main difference is that many different machines are
  provided by relays instead of a bundled list. The bundled `maybenot_machines` file was removed.
* Update Electron from 30.0.4 to 33.2.1.
* Move changelog from a dialog to a separate view.
* Reduce the setup time of PQ tunnels by pre-computing McEliece keys.

## [2025.2] - 2025-01-08

### Fixed

* Fix crash when Wireguard tunnel setup timed out.

## [2025.1] - 2025-01-02

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Fix GUI getting stuck when opening the split tunneling view.

## [2024.9-beta1] - 2024-12-05

### Added

* Add a new access method: Encrypted DNS Proxy. Encrypted DNS proxy is a way to reach the API via
  proxies. The access method is enabled by default.

#### macOS

* Detect whether full disk access is enabled in the split tunneling view.
* Add button to restart system service in split tunneling view. This can help mitigate edge-case
  issues when enabling full disk access.

### Changed

* Replace the draft key encapsulation mechanism Kyber (round 3) with the standardized
  ML-KEM (FIPS 203) dito in the handshake for Quantum-resistant tunnels.
* Make Smart Routing override multihop if both are enabled. To manually set the entry relay,
  explicitly enable the "Direct only" option in the DAITA settings.
* Update maybenot from 1.1.3 to 2.0.1.

#### Windows

* Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`).

### Fixed

* Handle network switching better when using WG over Shadowsocks.
* Fix multihop entry location list sometimes being shown when multihop is disabled.

#### macOS

* Fix packets being duplicated on LAN when split tunneling is enabled.
* Fix DNS issues caused by forcibly using a local DNS resolver in all states.
  Note that this fix is not present on macOS versions between 14.6 and 15.1.

### Security

#### Windows

* Block WSL/Hyper-V traffic in secured states (except the connected state). The normal firewall
  (WFP) filters normally do not apply for VMs. This mitigates the issue by ensuring that it does not
  leak (as easily) when the VPN tunnel is up. Previously, WSL would leak while in the blocked or
  connecting state, or while lockdown mode was active.

## [2024.8] - 2024-12-04

### Security

* Remove invalidly set up alternative stack for fault signal handlers on unix based systems.
  This prevents potential stack overflow and heap memory corruption.
  Fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-01`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-01).
* Remove/disable not signal safe code from fault signal handler on unix based systems.
  Fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-02`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-02).

#### Windows

* Fix issue where the installer would allow any executable named `taskkill.exe` in the working
  directory to run as admin. This fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-06`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-06).

#### Linux

* Prevent attackers able to send ARP requests to the device running Mullvad from figuring out
  the in-tunnel IP. Fixes 2024 audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-03`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-03).

## [2024.7] - 2024-10-30

This release is identical to 2024.7-beta1.

## [2024.7-beta1] - 2024-10-25

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Fix DNS not working due to broken PF redirect.

## [2024.6] - 2024-10-23

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Disable DNS redirect when custom DNS is set to localhost.

## [2024.6-beta2] - 2024-10-09

### Changed

* Move DAITA and multihop to the root settings view along with moving multihop into a dedicated
  view with more information.

#### macOS

* Enable IPv6 by default. This fixes DNS and routing being broken on some systems.
* Proxy DNS queries through a local resolver.

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Fix Apple services not working by forcing stray connections out through the VPN tunnel. This fix
  only applies to Wireguard, OpenVPN is still affected. The "bypass" toggle has been removed.

## [2024.6-beta1] - 2024-09-26

### Added

* Add WireGuard over Shadowsocks obfuscation. It can be enabled in "WireGuard settings". This will
  also be used automatically when connecting fails with other methods.
* Add feature indicators to the main view along with redesigning the connection details.
* Add "Smart Routing" feature which simplifies connecting to DAITA-enabled relays.

#### macOS

* Add "Apple services bypass" toggle that let's users unblock certain Apple-owned networks.
  This is a temporary fix to the MacOS 15 issues where some Apple services are being blocked.

### Changed

* Never use OpenVPN as a fallback protocol when any of the following features is enabled:
  multihop, quantum-resistant tunnels, or DAITA.
* Improved output format of `mullvad status` command, which now also prints feature indicators.

#### macOS

* Disable split tunnel interface when disconnected. This prevents traffic from being sent through
  the daemon when the VPN is disconnected.

### Fixed

* Add `--json` flag to `mullvad status` CLI.

### Changed

* Ignore obfuscation protocol constraints when the obfuscation mode is set to auto.

#### macOS

* Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`).

### Fixed

  too quickly.
* Fix bug causing app to enter blocked state when toggling DAITA on and off.

#### macOS

* Fix intermittent failures to connect with PQ enabled.

## [2024.4] - 2024-07-23

This release is identical to 2024.4-beta1.

## [2024.4-beta1] - 2024-06-24

### Added

* Add custom bridge settings in GUI.
* Bundle <https://github.com/mullvad/apisocks5> as a standalone binary.

### Fixed

#### Windows

* Fix race condition that could result in crashes when DAITA was enabled during disconnects.

## [2024.3] - 2024-05-15

This release is identical to 2024.3-beta1.

## [2024.3-beta1] - 2024-05-07

### Added

#### Windows

* Add DAITA (Defence against AI-guided Traffic Analysis) setting. On supported servers, this makes
  website fingerprinting more difficult by sending random padding packets along with padding all
  packets to the same size.

### Changed

* Don't fail to start daemon when the offline monitor fails to be initialized.

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Fix GUI not working on Ubuntu 24.04 by adding an AppArmor profile.
* Service failed to start when IPv6 was disabled in the kernel.

## [2024.2] - 2024-04-29

* Fix bug where the app would fail to select an existing relay in some scenarios, causing the
  user to wrongly end up in a blocked state.

#### macOS

* DNS was not properly restored in some cases when using custom DNS.

### Security

#### macOS

* Flush states on tunnel state changes. Previously, pre-existing connections could leak when
  internet sharing was enabled on a device.

#### Windows

* Update electron-builder to 24.13.3 to fix CVE-2024-27303, which enabled privilege escelation when
  running the installer.

## [2024.2-beta1] - 2024-04-15

### Added

* Add automatic MTU detection for desktop platforms. This currently only uses information about
  dropped packets and does not take fragmentation into account.
* Add ability to import server IP overrides in GUI.

### Changed

* Change default obfuscation setting to `auto`.
* Migrate obfuscation settings for existing users from `off` to `auto`.
* Change [default retry connection attempts](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/docs/relay-selector.md#default-constraints-for-tunnel-endpoints).

### Fixed

* Fix incorrectly showing "App lost contact with system service" notification on suspend.

## [2024.1] - 2024-03-21

### Fixed

* Fix map scaling issues when changing display scale settings and when running under Wayland on
  Linux.

#### macOS

* Fix bug that caused high CPU usage.
* Fix bugs that caused the log to be filled with socket errors, by handling closed sockets
  gracefully.

## [2024.1-beta2] - 2024-02-19

### Added

* Add account UUID to verbose 'mullvad account get -v' output.
* Respect OS prefer-reduced-motion setting.
* Add CLI command for exporting settings patches: `mullvad export-settings`. Currently, it generates
  a patch containing all patchable settings, which only includes relay IP overrides.
* Make `mullvad status` prints if lockdown mode is enabled when disconnected.
* Add option to configure custom API access methods. Custom API access methods allows the user to
  circumvent censorship by proxying API traffic.
* Add confirmation dialog when deleting a custom list.
* Add support for custom SOCKS5 OpenVPN bridges running locally.

### Fixed

* Fix connectivity issues that would occur when using quantum-resistant tunnels with an incorrectly
  configured MTU.
* Fix custom list name validation by not allowing empty names.

#### Linux

* Fix Bash shell completions for subcommands in the CLI.
* Fix out IP missing forever when am.i.mullvad.net returns error.

#### macOS

* Fix default route not being restored when disconnecting when the gateway was a link-local IPv6
  address.
* Fix app sometimes getting stuck in error state when the connection is unstable. This occurred
  when the default route was removed while connecting.
* Improve multihop performance by preventing fragmentation in the tunnel. This is done by setting
  an MTU on the default route.

### Changed

* Remove `--location` flag from `mullvad status` CLI. Location and IP will now always
  be printed (if available). `mullvad status listen` no longer prints location info.
* Change CLI interface for custom SOCKS5 bridges as part of supporting bridges running locally.
* Upgrade the background map to a new WebGL 3D map. This should both look better and be more
  performant.
* Update Electron from 26.3.0 to 28.1.3.
* Improve the "Connecting to system service"-view with information about the situation and
  troubleshooting tips.
* Update support email address to new email address, support@mullvadvpn.net.

#### Linux

* Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`). On other platforms, `auto` still
  always means the same thing as `off`.

#### Windows

* Add information to error notification about an error that is often caused by an incompatibility
  with VMWare.

## [2024.1-beta1] - 2023-12-14

### Added

* Add CLI support for applying patches to the settings with `mullvad import-settings`.

### Changed

* CLI command `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry-location` changed to
  `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry location`, as the `location` subcommand can now be
  swapped for `custom-list` to select entry relays using a custom list.

#### Linux

* Rename interface name from `wg-mullvad` to `wg0-mullvad`.

### Fixed

* Validate that hostname matches correct server type for CLI commands `mullvad relay set location`,
  `mullvad bridge set location`, and `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry location`.

#### Linux

* Prevent fragmentation when multihop is enabled by setting a default route MTU.
* Fix stable releases being considered a downgrade from a beta version by `dnf`.

## [2023.6] - 2023-12-06

### Changed

* Update OpenVPN to 2.6.8 from 2.6.0.

### Security

* Update OpenVPN to 2.6.8 to fix CVE-2023-46850, which could cause freed memory to be sent to the
  peer.

## [2023.6-beta1] - 2023-11-23

### Added

* Add customizable relay lists to the CLI on desktop. Custom lists can be managed through
  `mullvad custom-lists` and can be selected through `mullvad relay set` and `mullvad bridge set`.
* Add custom lists to location selector in desktop app.
* Add custom API access methods to the CLI on desktop. Custom API access methods allow the user to
  proxy API traffic through a peer before connecting to a tunnel. They are managed through
  `mullvad api-access`, and the initially supported network protocols are `Shadowsocks` and
  `SOCKS5`.
* Add social media content blocker.
* Add ability to override server IPs to the CLI.

### Changed

* Update Electron from 25.2.0 to 26.3.0.

#### Linux

* Don't block forwarding of traffic when the split tunnel mark (ct mark) is set.

### Removed

#### Windows

* Remove wireguard-go (userspace WireGuard) support.

### Fixed

* Show correct endpoint in CLI for custom relays.
* Lower risk of being rate limited.
* Fix error dialog when failing to write to console by handling the thrown error.
* Fix error dialog displayed when the daemon was killed.
* Fix desktop app freezing when navigations occur in very quick succession.

#### Windows

* Correctly detect whether OS is Windows Server (primarily for logging in daemon.log).

### Security

#### Windows

* Fix possible privilege escalation by setting stricter permissions on mullvad directories such as
  the directory in ProgramData (CVE-2023-50446).

## [2023.5] - 2023-10-10

### Added

#### Linux

* Start signing the deb and rpm files (GPG)

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Fix connectivity issues when switching between networks or disconnecting.

## [2023.5-beta2] - 2023-09-20

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Ensure that the default tunnel route is added back after waking from hibernation. Previously, the
  tunnel became unusable despite the app appearing to be connected.
* Work around issue where the default route was lost after disconnecting after switching between
  networks.
* Fix slow offline detection.
* Fix inability to switch from a network to a higher-priority network without the tunnel timing out.

## [2023.5-beta1] - 2023-07-13

### Added

* Add `--help` and `--version` options to the desktop GUI application.
* Add creation date below device name in the device list screen.
* Add account view button in main view in the desktop app.
* Add time left and device name in the header bar in the desktop app.

### Changed

* In the CLI, update the `tunnel` subcommand to resemble `relay` more. For example, by adding a
  unified `mullvad tunnel get` command and removing individual `get` subcommands like
  `mullvad tunnel ipv6 get`.
* Update the CLI multihop settings to make it possible to set the entry location without toggling
  multihop on or off.
* In the CLI, the `mullvad account get` command will now print the account number (if there is one)
  after the device has been revoked.
* Update the CLI relay, multihop & bridge selection interface to accept a hostname as sole argument,
  inheriting the behavior of `mullvad relay set hostname`. This is in addition to accepting a
  geographical location as basis for filtering relays.
* Silence OpenVPN "replay attack" warnings.
* Update Electron from 23.2.0 to 25.2.0.

#### Windows

* In the CLI, add a unified `mullvad split-tunnel get` command to replace the old commands
  `mullvad split-tunnel pid list` and `mullvad split-tunnel get`.

### Fixed

* Update relay list after logging in. Previously, if the user wasn't logged in when the daemon
  started, the relay list would only be updated after attempting to connect to the VPN.

#### macOS

* Fix inability to sync iCloud and Safari bookmarks while connected to the VPN.

### Removed

* Remove the CLI subcommand `mullvad relay set hostname`.

## [2023.4] - 2023-06-27

### Fixed

* Fix misaligned read in `shadowsocks` leading to a panic on some platforms.

## [2023.4-beta1] - 2023-05-02

### Added

* Log select settings on each connection attempt.

### Changed

* Update Electron from 21.1.1 to 23.2.0.

#### macOS

* Change macOS app signing key and certificates. Replace those issued to Amagicom AB (the parent
  company of Mullvad VPN AB) with new certificates issued directly to Mullvad VPN AB.

### Deprecated

#### Linux

* Deprecated support for Debian 10. This also means dropping support for glibc older
  than 2.31 and Linux kernels older than 5.10.

### Fixed

* Fix location search in desktop app only searching for English location names.
* Fix automatic WireGuard key rotation not being initialized correctly when not running the GUI.
* Fix duplicated notifications in some situations.
* Fix notification setting being inverted. When non-important notifications were disabled it instead
  disabled important ones and showed non-important ones.
* Work around issues with PQ and multihop caused by fragmentation in the tunnel. The workaround
  doesn't fix fragmentation issues in general but prevents the PSK exchange packets from being
  fragmented by setting an explicit maximum segment size.

#### macOS

* Fix tray window behaviour when opening mission control and switching between full-screen
  workspaces.
* Fix issue where app stopped responding on ARM Macs.

#### Linux

* Fix RPM package containing unecessary files causing conflicts with other electron-builder based
  packages.

## [2023.3] - 2023-04-05

### Changed

* Change WireGuard key rotation interval to 14 days. It was 7 days on desktop and 4 days on
  Android.

## [2023.3-beta1] - 2023-03-23

### Added

* Add Kyber1024 KEM algorithm into the Post-Quantum secure key exchange algorithm. This means the
  Quantum-resistant-tunnels feature now mixes both Classic McEliece and Kyber for added protection.
* Add notification dot to tray icon and system notification throttling.
* Add troubleshooting information to some in-app notifications.
* Add setting for quantum-resistant tunnels to the desktop GUI.
* Enable `TCP_NODELAY` for the socket used by WireGuard over TCP. Improves latency and performance.

### Changed

* Update the Post-Quantum secure key exchange gRPC client to use the stabilized
  `PskExchangeV1` endpoint
* Add "auto" setting for the quantum-resistant tunnel feature, and make it the default. If it was
  previously set to off, it will now be set to auto instead. That currently means the same thing as
  "off", but this might change in the future.
* Update OpenVPN to 2.6.0 from 2.5.3.
* Update OpenSSL to 1.1.1t from 1.1.1j.
* Post-Quantum secure tunnels and multihop can now be used at the same time.

#### Windows

* Remove automatic fallback to wireguard-go. This is done as a first step before fully
  deprecating it on Windows.

### Removed

* Remove port 443 as valid port for WireGuard over TCP. Keep only port 80 and 5001. The reason is
  to free up port 443 for other TCP based obfuscation later.

### Fixed

* Fix close to expiry notification not showing unless app is opened once within the last three days
  in the desktop app.
* Retry if PQ PSK negotiation fails for any reason.
* Fix accumulated tunnel state notifications sometimes displayed after suspend.

## [2023.2] - 2023-03-06

### Fixed

#### Windows

* Fix desktop app not quitting properly after switching from unpinned to pinned window.
* Fix service not starting when LSA protection is enabled (which is the default on Windows 11 22H2).
* Fix some issues with setting system DNS by using SetInterfaceDnsSettings when it's available (on
  Windows 10, version 1809 and above).

## [2023.1] - 2023-02-20

### Fixed

#### Windows

* Don't fail to show the mullvad-daemon help text if some of the default paths cannot be obtained.

## [2023.1-beta2] - 2023-02-06

### Fixed

* Fix sorting of devices in the "too many devices"-view to properly sort on device creation time.

#### macOS

* Improved reliability of the connectivity check workaround by adding an extra captive portal check
  domain.
* Show "Mullvad VPN" in the Login Items UI instead of "Amagicom AB".
* Detect whether users need to approve the launch daemon in the Login Items UI.

## [2023.1-beta1] - 2023-01-26

### Added

* Add quit button to tray context menu on Linux and Window.
* Add search bar to location list in desktop app.

#### Windows

* Remove all settings when the app is uninstalled silently.

### Changed

* Update Electron from 19.0.13 to 21.1.1.

### Fixed

* When a country is selected, and the constraints only match relays that are not included on the
  country level, select those relays anyway.
* Fix regression where WireGuard relays were connected to over OpenVPN after a couple of failed
  attempts, when the tunnel type was set to `any`.
* Fix missing connect timeout when connecting to a WireGuard relay over TCP.
* Fix failure to apply firewall rules that could occur when connecting timed out.

#### macOS

* Fix fish shell completions when installed via Homebrew on Apple Silicon Macs.

#### Linux

* Remove last filesystem dependency of early boot blocking unit.
* Ensure RPM package removes all application directories when uninstalled.
* Fix architecture field for ARM RPM builds so the app installs on Fedora based distros.

#### Windows

* Ignore adapters that have no valid GUID when removing obsolete Wintun interfaces during install.
  Previously, the installer would abort.
* Revert to using netsh for DNS config, as some Windows builds did not deal with changes correctly.
  `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` can be used to override this.
* Fix deadlock that could occur when the default route changed while initializing split tunneling.

### Removed

#### macOS

* Remove ⌘Q shortcut.

### Security

#### Windows

* DNS loopback traffic is no longer blocked. Note that local resolvers are still unable to forward
  queries to servers that would normally be blocked.

## [2022.5] - 2022-10-14

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Don't prevent early boot service from running if logging to a file fails.

## [2022.5-beta2] - 2022-10-05

### Added

* Add custom option to WireGuard port selector.

#### Linux

* Add ARM64 (aarch64) builds. This is the first release with Linux ARM support.

### Changed

* Experimental: Upgrade the support for quantum-resistant WireGuard tunnels to a newer protocol.

### Fixed

* Reset known location when connecting to a custom relay.

#### Linux

* Fix app crashing immediately when using some icon themes.

## [2022.5-beta1] - 2022-09-26

### Added

* Add obfuscation settings under "WireGuard settings".

#### Windows

* The default VPN protocol is slowly being changed from OpenVPN to WireGuard.
  The app fetches the ratio between the protocols from the API.

#### Linux

* GUI: Add electron flags to run Wayland native if in a compositor/desktop known to work well
* Add support for Linux ARM64. No installers are produced yet. But the source code can now
  be built for ARM64.

### Changed

* Reject invalid WireGuard ports in the CLI.
* Reorganize settings into more logical categories.
* Upgrade wireguard-go to 20220703234212 (Windows: v0.5.3).
* Prune bridges far away from the selected relay.
* Stay connected when desktop app is killed or crashes. The only situation where the app now
  disconnects on quit is when the user presses the quit button.
* Update Electron from 18.0.3 to 19.0.13.
* Expand allowed range of multicast destinations to include all of `239.0.0.0/8` (administratively
  scoped addresses), when local network sharing is enabled.
* Default to selecting Sweden as the entry location when using WireGuard multihop. Previously,
  a random location was used.

#### Windows

* Remove dependency on `ipconfig.exe`. Call `DnsFlushResolverCache` to flush the DNS cache.
* Upgrade Wintun to 0.14.1.

#### Linux

* The daemon binary and systemd unit file will now be placed in `/usr/bin/` and
  `/usr/lib/systemd/system` respectively, to aid with starting the system service on systems where
  `/opt` isn't mounted during early boot.

### Fixed

* Connect to TCP endpoints over IPv6 if IPv6 is enabled for WireGuard.
* Fix udp2tcp not working when quantum-resistant tunnels are enabled.
* Quit app gracefully if renderer process is killed or crashes.
* Enable reconnect in blocked state in desktop app.
* Fix error handling during device removal in the desktop app.
* Enable interface settings when app is logged out
* Fix 'mullvad status -v' to include the port of the endpoint when connecting over TCP.
* Check whether the device is valid when reconnecting from the error state.
* Stop reconnecting when the account has run out of time.
* Show out of time view after failing to connect due to being out of time.

#### Windows

* Only use the most recent list of apps to split when resuming from hibernation/sleep if applying
  it was successful.
* Don't fail install if the device tree contains nameless callout driver devices.

### Security

* When the system service is being shut down and the target state is *secured*, maintain the
  blocking firewall rules. Unless it's possible to deduce that the system isn't shutting down and
  the system service is being stopped by the user intentionally. This is to prevent leaks that might
  occur during system shutdown. Fixes 2022 Mullvad app audit issue item `MUL22-02`.

#### Windows

* Upgrade win-split-tunnel driver to version 1.2.2.0. Fixes incomplete validation of input buffers
  that could result in out-of-bounds reads. Fixes 2022 Mullvad app audit issue item `MUL22-01`.

#### Linux

* Added traffic blocking during early boot, before the daemon starts, to prevent leaks in the case
  that the system service starts after a networking daemon has already configured a network
  interface.

## [2022.4] - 2022-08-19

### Added

#### Windows

* Windows daemon now looks up the MTU on the default interface and uses this MTU instead of the
  default 1500. The 1500 is still the fallback if this for some reason fails. This may stop
  fragmentation.

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Fix issue where MTU could not be manually set in the app.
* Lower the max MTU from the automatic MTU detection down to 1380,
  which was the hardcoded default before the automatic detection was implemented.
  This solves issues where the physical interface MTU was set higher than it could
  actually transport.

## [2022.3] - 2022-08-10

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2022.3-beta3.

## [2022.3-beta3] - 2022-07-28

### Fixed

* Fix showing incompatible relay filtering options in desktop app. The filtering options are now
  dependent on the other filters.

#### Windows

* Fix app occasionally getting stuck in the offline state after being suspended.

#### Linux

* Fixed incompatibility with newer kernel versions (5.19 and up).

### Security

#### Windows

* Fix potential leak window when stopping the service and auto-connect is enabled and always
  require VPN is disabled. When stopped, usually due to a reboot, the daemon would disconnect
  before entering a blocking state.

## [2022.3-beta2] - 2022-06-29

### Fixed

#### Windows

* Fix DNS issue on non-English Windows installations. Don't parse the output of ipconfig.exe
  to determine if the tool succeeded.

## [2022.3-beta1] - 2022-06-27

### Added

* Add option to filter relays by ownership in the desktop apps.
* Experimental: Add support for quantum-resistant PSK exchange to the CLI.

#### Linux

* Automatically attempt to detect and set the correct MTU for Wireguard tunnels.

#### Windows

* Add CLI command for listing excluded processes.

### Removed

#### Linux

* Remove upstart init configuration files

### Fixed

* Display consistent colors regardless of monitor color profile on desktop.
* Fix time added view displayed due to incorrect local clock.

#### Windows

* Be more scrupulous about removing temporary files used by the installer and uninstaller.
* Fix issue where local name resolution fails. This requires users to ensure that non-tunnel
  interfaces are configured correctly to use local custom DNS.
* Configure DNS correctly when the DNS client service is disabled or not responding.

## [2022.2] - 2022-06-13

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2022.2-beta2.

## [2022.2-beta2] - 2022-06-10

### Added

* Include creation timestamp for devices in the CLI.

### Changed

* List devices on an account sorted by creation date, oldest to newest, instead of alphabetically.

### Fixed

* Fix logout failing if the API cannot be reached in the GUI.

## [2022.2-beta1] - 2022-05-16

### Added

* Extend DNS blocking with the following new categories: "Adult content" and "gambling".
* Obfuscate traffic to the Mullvad API using bridges if it cannot be reached directly.
* Add device management to desktop app. This simplifies knowing which device is which and adds the
  option to log out other devices when there are already 5 connected when logging in.
* Add tray icon tooltip with connection info in desktop app.
* Add relay and bridge constraints for restricting relay selection to rented or Mullvad-owned
  relays. Allows filtering servers by ownership in the CLI.

#### Windows

* Detect mounting and dismounting of volumes, such as VeraCrypt volumes or USB drives,
  and exclude paths from the tunnel correctly when these occur. This sometimes only works
  when the GUI frontend is running.
* Add toggle for split tunneling state.

### Changed

* Update settings format to `v6`.
* Move WireGuard TCP obfuscation settings into `mullvad obfuscation` command in CLI.
* Decrease the size of fonts, some icons and other design elements in the desktop app. This makes it
  possible to fit more into the same area and makes text easier to read.
* Don't block the tunnel state machine while starting the tunnel monitor. This also means that
  the machine will not transition directly from the `disconnected` to the `disconnecting` state
  if an error occurs.
* Change behavior of escape key in the desktop app. It now navigates backwards one step instead of
  to the main view. To navigate back to the main view Shift+Escape can be used.
* Update Electron from 16.0.4 to 18.0.3.
* Randomize bridge selection with a bias in favor of close bridges.
* Make login field keep previous value when submitting an incorrect account number in desktop app.
* Decrease the time it takes to connect to WireGuard relays by sending an ICMP packet immediately.
* Pause API interactions when the daemon has not been used for 3 days.
* Simplified output of `mullvad status` command.

### Fixed

* Fix the sometimes incorrect time added text after adding time to the account.
* Fix scrollbar no longer responsive and usable when covered by other elements.
* Improve tunnel bypass for the API sometimes not working in the connecting state.
* Fix resource leak caused by location check.
* Fix issue where sockets didn't close after disconnecting from WireGuard servers over TCP
  by updating `udp-over-tcp` to 0.2.
* Parse old account history formats correctly when they are empty.
* Use suspend-aware timers for relay list updates and version checks on all platforms.
* Don't attempt to use bridges when using OpenVPN over UDP and bridge mode is set to auto.
* Use the entry endpoint when the relay selector fails to find a relay using the preferred
  constraints and the tunnel protocol is "any". Previously, the entry endpoint was ignored in this
  case.

#### Windows

* Fix "Open Mullvad VPN" tray context menu item not working after toggling unpinned window setting.
* Fix apps not always visible in split tunneling view after browsing for an app and then removing it
  from the excluded applications.
* Fix navigation resetting to main view when toggling the unpinned window setting.
* Log splitting event reason correctly.

#### macOS

* Fix thrashing due to DNS config monitoring.

### Security

#### Windows

* Update split tunnel driver to 1.2.1.0. This fixes potential DNS leaks seen when excluding at least
  one application.

## [2022.1] - 2022-03-01

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2022.1-beta2 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.

## [2022.1-beta2] - 2022-02-22

### Added

* Show warning message when blocking internet while logged out, and make it possible to unblock the
  connection from the login view.

### Fixed

* Prevent settings file being truncated before being read. This caused the daemon to read an empty
  settings file, restore to default settings and log out.
* Improve performance for automatically scrolling text in desktop app.
* Increase availability of the API by allowing to issue requests to the API when connecting to the
  relay even if account data might be invalid.

### Security

* Enable "Always require VPN" by default if the settings cannot be parsed. This reduces the number
  of errors that lead to the daemon unexpectedly starting into non-blocking mode.

## [2022.1-beta1] - 2022-02-14

### Added

* Add information about the always on kill switch in the desktop app.
* Add WireGuard multihop setting and entry location selection to desktop app.
* Add malware blocking to the desktop app. Implemented via DNS on the relays.
* Add changes dialog which will include the most notable changes in each new version.

### Changed

* Keep unspecified constraints unchanged in the CLI when providing specific tunnel constraints
  instead of setting them to default values.
* Obscure account number in account view and add button for copying instead of copying when text is
  pressed.
* Disable logging of translation errors in production. This will among other things prevent error
  messages from translating the country in the disconnected state.
* Update Electron from 15.0.0 to 16.0.4.
* Stop preferring OpenVPN when bridge mode is enabled.
* CLI command for setting a specific server by hostname is no longer case sensitive.
  Example: `mullvad relay set hostname SE9-WIREGUARD` should now work.
* Update the default Shadowsocks password to `mullvad` and cipher to `aes-256-gcm` in the CLI
  when using it to configure a *custom Shadowsocks bridge*. The Mullvad bridges recently changed
  these parameters on port 443 (which is the default port).

#### Windows

* Update wireguard-nt to 0.10.1.
* Make wireguard-nt the default driver for WireGuard. This is used instead of wireguard-go and
  Wintun.
* Increase firewall transaction timeout from 2 to 5 seconds to lower the chance of errors when
  setting the firewall policy.
* Update split tunnel driver to 1.2.0.0. Notably, this driver release allows firewall filters
  added by other software to block excluded apps.

### Removed

#### Windows

* Drop support for pre-Windows 10 systems.

### Fixed

* Always kill `sslocal` if the tunnel monitor fails to start when using bridges.
* Show relay location constraint correctly in the CLI when it is set to `any`.
* Prevent gRPC from trying to run the app-daemon IPC communication through a HTTP proxy when the
  environment variable `http_proxy` is set. This caused the app to fail to connect to the daemon.
* Disable built-in DNS resolver in Electron. Prevents Electron from establishing connections to
  DNS servers set in system network preferences.
* Fix tray context menu showing or executing wrong actions, using wrong language or in other
  ways not update properly.

#### macOS

* Resolve issues with the app blocking internet connectivity after sleep or when connecting to new
  wireless networks.
* Fix issue where the app would get stuck in offline state after a reboot or a reinstall by using
  `route monitor` instead of relying on `SCNetworkReachability` API to infer whether the host is
  offline.

#### Windows

* Fix app size after changing display scale.
* Fix daemon not starting if all excluded app paths reside on non-existent/unmounted volumes.
* Remove tray icon of current running app version when upgrading.
* Allow Mullvad wireguard-nt tunnels to work simultaneously with other wg-nt tunnels.
* Fix notifications on Windows not showing if window is unpinned and hidden.
* Wait for IP interfaces to arrive before trying to configure them when using wireguard-nt.
* Fix panic that occurs in the split tunnel monitor when a path consisting only of a prefix,
  such as "C:", is excluded using the CLI.

#### Linux

* Remove auto-launch file, GUI settings and other files created by the app in user directories, when
  uninstalling/purging.

### Security

* Restrict which applications are allowed to communicate with the API while in a blocking state.
  This prevents malicious scripts on websites from trying to do so. On Windows, only
  `mullvad-problem-report.exe` and `mullvad-daemon.exe` executables are allowed to reach the API,
  whereas on Linux and macOS only root processes are able to reach the API.

## [2021.6] - 2021-11-17

### Fixed

* Fix the font for Russian. Issue introduced in 2021.6-beta1.
  Bundle a version of Source Sans Pro containing Cyrillic.

## [2021.6-beta1] - 2021-11-03

### Added

#### Windows

* Add black monochromatic tray icon for Windows when using light color for tray.

### Changed

* Update Electron from 11.4.9 to 15.0.0.
* Revamp main view with blurred background behind semi-transparent buttons and switch to
  correct font for logo. Also a slightly less bold font in other parts of the app.

### Removed

* Remove the old Let's encrypt root certificate from the API REST client. Only bundle and
  use the latest certificate.

### Fixed

* Fix desktop app showing a future date for when WireGuard key was generated.
* Fix desktop app split tunneling view to not overflow on very long application names.
* Prevent API requests from being made prior to the tunnel state machine being set up.
  Rarely, failed requests could result in a deadlock.
* Fix segmentation fault when closing app (the GUI).

#### Windows

* Fix detection of Windows 11. Problem reports will now correctly report Windows 11 instead
  of Windows 10.
* Fix race condition in split tunneling initialization. Listen to route changes before reading
  out the default route.
* Fix bug in split tunneling code that could make the kernel driver and mullvad-daemon out of
  sync around which programs should be excluded when the driver took longer to respond.
* Use route-based offline monitoring. Fixes issues where the daemon falsely entered the offline
  state, for example when using virtual switches in Hyper-V.
* Improve repositioning of app window after connecting/disconnecting external monitor.

#### macOS

* Prevent app from showing when dragging tray icon on macOS.
* Move window after dragging tray icon to new position.

#### Linux

* Greatly simplify behavior around custom DNS when using systemd-resolved, by not setting DNS config
  on interfaces other than our tunnel interface.

## [2021.5] - 2021-10-25

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2021.5-beta2 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.

## [2021.5-beta2] - 2021-10-19

### Fixed

#### macOS

* Fix issue with getting PF status due to an ABI change on macOS 12 Beta 9.

## [2021.5-beta1] - 2021-10-12

### Added

* Added possibility to filter locations by provider in the desktop app.
* Add ability to use WireGuard over TCP towards all relays via the desktop CLI. However,
  this service is not yet available on all relays. At the time of writing, this only
  works towards `se6-wireguard`, `se9-wireguard` and `se17-wireguard`.
* Add GUI environment variable `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION`. If set to `1`, GUI
  notification will be disabled when an update is available. This is not intended to be set by
  normal users.
* Add setting for changing between IPv4 and IPv6 for the connection to WireGuard servers on
  desktop.

#### Windows

* Resolve symbolic links and junctions for excluded apps.
* Add opt-in support for NT kernel WireGuard driver. It can be enabled in the CLI.
  Should give better performance. Especially over Wi-Fi.

### Changed

* Only use the account history file to store the last used account.
* Update the out of time-view and new account-view to make it more user friendly.
* Change the app update notification when the suggested version is a beta, to include that it's a
  beta.
* Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.5.1 to 2.5.3.
* Update Electron from 11.2.3 to 11.4.9.
* Move OpenVPN and WireGuard settings in the advanced settings view into separate settings views.
* Return to main view in desktop app after being hidden/closed for two minutes.
* Settings format updated from `v3` to `v5`.

#### Linux

* Always send DNS requests inside the tunnel for excluded processes when using public custom DNS.

#### Windows

* Upgrade Wintun from 0.10.4 to 0.13.
* Reduce tunnel setup time for OpenVPN by disabling DAD.

### Fixed

* Fix link to download page not always using the beta URL when it should.
* Fix deadlock that may occur when the API cannot be reached while entering the connecting state.
* Fix bug causing desktop app to log in if account number field was filled when removing account
  history.
* Fix lack of account expiry updates when using the app in unpinned mode and improve updating of
  account expiry overall.
* Fix incorrect WireGuard relay filtering when exit and entry locations overlap.
* Fix wrong translations when switching to/from unpinned window after changing language in the
  desktop app.
* Fix in-app notification button not working for some notifications.
* Fix incorrectly positioned navigation bar title when navigating back to a scrolled down view.
* Fix connectivity check for WireGuard multihop when the exit hop is down.
* Fix incorrect location and connection status while disconnecting and incorrect location in the
  beginning while connecting in the desktop app.
* Improve responsiveness of the controls and status text in the main view in the desktop app.
* Read macOS scrollbar visibility settings to decide whether or not the scrollbars should hide when
  not scrolling.
* Fix IPv6 connections to WireGuard servers by not dropping select neighbor advertisements and
  solicitations.

#### Linux

* Make offline monitor aware of routing table changes.
* Assign local DNS servers to more appropriate interfaces when using systemd-resolved.
* Disable DNS over TLS for tunnel's DNS config when using systemd-resolved.
* Fix DNS when combining a static resolv.conf with ad blocking DNS.
* Check connectivity correctly on IPv6-only networks.

#### Windows

* Fix failure to restart the daemon when resuming from "fast startup" hibernation.
* Fix OpenVPN not responding to shutdown signals when they are sent early on, causing it to close
  after 30 seconds.
* Disable notification actions for persistent notifications since they were called when pressing
  close.
* Remove deleted network devices from consideration in the offline monitor. Previously, the offline
  monitor may have falsely reported the machine to be online due to a race condition.
* Recover firewall state correctly when restarting the service after a crash. This would fail when
  paths were excluded.
* Fix daemon not starting when a path is excluded on a drive that has since been removed.
* Prefer WireGuard if the constraints preclude OpenVPN and the tunnel protocol is "auto", instead
  of failing due to "no matching relays".
* Retry tunnel device creation multiple times to work around issues early after boot or hibernation.

## [2021.4] - 2021-06-30

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2021.4-beta1 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.

## [2021.4-beta1] - 2021-06-09

This release is for desktop only.

### Added

* When `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` is set, only allow the specified group to access the
  management interface UDS socket. This means that only users in that group can use the CLI and GUI.
* Support WireGuard over TCP for custom VPN relays in the CLI. (Our relays don't support this yet).
* Make app native on Apple Silicon.
* Support WireGuard multihop using an entry endpoint constraint in the CLI.
* Add Ad and tracker blocking to the desktop app. Implemented via DNS on the relays.

#### Windows

* Add split tunneling as a beta feature. Allows excluding some applications from the VPN tunnel.

### Changed

* Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1.
* Replace CLI command `mullvad custom-dns` with the new command `mullvad dns`.
* Upgrade wireguard-go to `20210521230051` (Windows: v0.3.14)

  Previously, bridges were expected to run as root instead.
* Use an ICMP socket instead of relying on a `ping` binary in `$PATH` to establish if a tunnel is
  working.

#### macOS

* Update shape of macOS icon to be in line with Apple's guidelines.

### Fixed

* Fix relay selection failing to pick a WireGuard relay when no tunnel protocol is specified.
* Fix time left not always being translated in desktop app settings.
* Fix API address cache to use the supplied ports instead of always using port 443.
* Do not try to parse an empty account history.

#### Windows

* Prevent tray icons from being extracted to `%TEMP%` directory.
* Fix failure to create Wintun adapter due to a residual network interface by upgrading Wintun to
  0.10.4.
* Wait indefinitely for IP interfaces to attach to the tunnel device to prevent early timeouts,
  and errors setting interface metrics.
* Prevent Microsoft Store from dropping packets in WireGuard tunnels.

#### Linux

* Fix find `mullvad-vpn.desktop` in `XDG_DATA_DIRS` instead of using hardcoded path.

#### MacOS

* Set correct permissions for daemon's launch file in installer.
* Fix downgrades on macOS silently keeping previous version.
* Fix other menubar context menus not always closing when opening app on macOS 11.

### Security

#### Linux

* Drop packets being *forwarded* unless they are approved by the same rules as incoming or outgoing
  traffic.

## [2021.3] - 2021-04-28

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2021.3-beta2

## [2021.3-beta2] - 2021-04-22

This release is for Windows only.
This release has no functional changes compared to 2021.3-beta1. The only
difference is that the installer and the binaries are signed with our
new code signing certificate. The old one is expiring.

The new certificate is brand new and Windows does not really trust it yet.
So there might be warnings when installing this for a while.

## [2021.3-beta1] - 2021-04-13

This release is for desktop only.

### Added

* Enable isolation of the Electron renderer process to protect against potentially malicious third
  party dependencies.
* Preserve log of old daemon instance when upgrading on Desktop.
* Add 51820 to list of WireGuard ports in app settings.
* Add option to connect to WireGuard relays over IPv6.
* Add Burmese translations.

#### Linux

* Always enable `src_valid_mark` config option when connecting to allow policty based routing.

### Changed

* Update Electron from 11.0.2 to 11.2.1 which includes a newer Chromium version and
  security patches.
* Allow provider constraint to specify multiple hosting providers.
* Only download a new relay list if it has been modified.
* Connect to the API only via TLS 1.3
* Shrink account history capactity from 3 account entries to 1.
* Allow whitespace in account token in CLI.
* Read account token from standard input unless given as an argument in CLI.
* Make WireGuard automatic key rotation interval mandatory and between 1 and 7 days.
* Show default, minimum, and maximum key rotation intervals in CLI.
* Attempt to send problem reports using other endpoints if using the primary one fails.
* Upgrade wireguard-go to version 20210225140808 (Windows: v0.3.8)
* Settings format updated to `v3`.

#### Windows

* Upgrade Wintun from 0.9.2 to 0.10.1.

### Fixed

* Fix delay in showing/hiding update notification when toggling beta program.
* Improve responsiveness when reconnecting after some failed connection attempts.
* Fix GUI not showing correct view if disconnected from the daemon during app startup.
* Fix incorrectly displayed "inconsistent version" text in settings if disconnected from daemon on
  startup.

#### Windows

* Fix "cannot find the file" error while creating a Wintun adapter by upgrading Wintun.
* Retry when creating a WireGuard tunnel fails due to no default routes being found.

#### Linux

* Stop using NM for managing DNS if it's newer than 1.26.
* Fix DNS issues where NM would overwrite Mullvad tunnel's DNS config in systemd-resolved.
* Fix issues with hosts where the firewall is doing reverse path filtering.
* Further improve offline monitor to properly receive `ENETUNREACH`.

### Security

* Always reconnect appropriately after an upgrade. Previously, installing the app twice in
  succession, with auto-connect disabled, would cause it to re-launch in the disconnected state.

## [2021.2] - 2021-02-18

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2021.2-beta1

## [2021.2-beta1] - 2021-02-17

This release is for desktop only.

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Fix crash when trying to apply IPv6 routes for OpenVPN when IPv6 is disabled.
* Ignore failure to add IPv6 split-tunneling routing rules when they fail due to IPv6 being
  unavailable.

#### Windows

* Fix failure when Wintun adapter name conflicts with that of a non-Wintun adapter.
* Fix detection of SetupAPI patch when not installed by KB2921916.

## [2021.1] - 2021-02-10

This release is for desktop only.

### Fixed

* Fix crash on desktop when entering problem report view when using an outdated app version.

## [2021.1-beta2] - 2021-02-03

This release is for desktop only.

### Fixed

* Make it impossible to apply an empty list of custom DNS server IPs.
  Stops the daemon from getting stuck in the offline state on macOS.

#### Windows

* Only load and unload the Wintun driver once instead of on every connection.
  Will hopefully fix an issue where it gave an error

## [2021.1-beta1] - 2021-01-25

This release is for desktop only.

### Added

* Add header containing OS version to version-check API call to enable OS specific compatibility and
  vulnerability checks.
* Add `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` environment variable to allow users to disable offline
  detection.

#### Android

* Allow to configure the tunnel to use custom DNS servers.
* Show only applications that has INTERNET permission on split tunnel screen.

#### Linux

* Improved compatiblitiy with newer versions of systemd-resolved.
* Add version data to problem reports for the following software: the kernel, NetworkManager,
  WireGuard kernel module, SystemD.

### Changed

* Allow the API to be accessed while in a blocking state.
* Prefer the last used API endpoint when the service starts back up, as well as in other tools such
  as the problem report tool.
* Migrate cache to a directory readable by all users, consistent with Android and Linux.
* Change the default value of the GUI auto-connect setting to "off" and respect the setting when
  logging in.

#### Linux

* Improve offline check to query the routing table to allow users to use a bridged adapter as their
  primary interface.

### Fixed

* Fix Turkish translations for on/off in the bridge settings. They were inverted, so it was
  confusing to change the setting.
* Stop returning bogus version information when there is no version cache.

#### Linux

* Fix missing app window icon in Xfce.

#### Windows

* Resolve single-label hostnames correctly.

### Security

* Default to connecting when the daemon starts if the target state cache cannot be read or parsed.

#### Linux

* Prevent the private tunnel IPv6 address from being detectable on a local network when using
  OpenVPN by correctly applying the fix for
  [CVE-2019-14899](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/122).

#### Windows

* Deny network access to the OpenVPN plugin pipe, which allowed for anonymous write access when
  passwordless file sharing was enabled.

## [2020.8-beta2] - 2020-12-11

This release is for desktop only.

### Added

#### Android

* Add a screen to view the logs included in a problem report.

### Changed

* Upgrade wireguard-go to v0.0.20201118.
* Reduce logging about time outs when conneting to a WireGuard tunnel.

### Fixed

#### Android

* Fix login appearing to be cancelled after leaving the login screen while logging in.
* Fix login input area missing some times when opening the login screen.

## [2020.8-beta1] - 2020-11-30

This release is for Android only.

### Added

* Improve accessibility in the desktop app. UI elements now have the correct role
  and are labeled to allow usage of a screen reader.
* Add `--wait` flag to `connect`, `disconnect` and `reconnect` CLI subcommands to make the CLI wait
  for the target state to be reached before exiting.
* Navigate back to the main view when escape is pressed.
* Add support for custom DNS resolvers on Windows, macOS and Linux. For now only resolvers in the
  local network will work properly.

#### Windows

* Add setting that unpins the window from the tray icon to let the user move it around freely.

### Changed

* Never use DNS to get the IP to contact the Mullvad API over. Instead a list of IPs is bundled
  with the app, and updates are fetched from the API itself. This list is then shuffled and used
  to pick a way to reach the API. This avoids censored/fake DNS responses and increases the
  likelihood to be able to talk to the API.
* Remove WireGuard keys during uninstallation after the firewall is unlocked.
* Rename CLI subcommand `mullvad relay set relay` to `mullvad relay set hostname`.
* Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.9 to 2.5.0.
* Upgrade Electron from 8.5.2 to Electron 11.0.2.

#### Android

* Remove the Quit button.
* Add button to remove account and WireGuard key from history in the login screen.
* Improve navigation in the app using a keyboard, so that touchless devices (like TVs) can be used
  more smoothly.
* Run app in landscape mode on TVs.
* Try to connect even if VPN permission is denied, so that the app shows an error message saying
  that the VPN permission was denied.

#### Windows

* Fully uninstall the old app when performing a downgrade. This solves the problem of downgrades
  not being able to migrate from something newer. For example it fully removes any blocking
  firewall rules a newer app might have put in place.
* Use Wintun instead of the OpenVPN TAP driver for OpenVPN.

#### Linux

* Increase NetworkManager device readiness timeout to 15 seconds.
* Set up routes for OpenVPN using our route manager instead of relying on OpenVPN to do it.
* Use rule-based routing and static routes. Avoids monitoring and duplicating the main routing
  table into a separate table.

### Fixed

* Fix missing map animation after selecting a new location in the desktop app.
* Fix crash on older kernels which report a default route through the loopback interface.

#### Android

* Fix connect action button sometimes showing itself as "Cancel" instead of "Secure my connection"
  for a few seconds.
* Fix the notification sometimes leaving the foreground and becoming dismissable even if the UI was
  still visible.
* Fix crash if connection to service is lost while opening the Split Tunneling settings screen.
* Fix rare crash that could occur when the tunnel state changes when showing or hiding the quick
  settings tile.
* Fix app starting by itself sometimes.
* Fix apps not being excluded from the tunnel sometimes if auto-connect was enabled.
* Fix crash that happened sometimes when closing the app or when requesting from the notification
  or the quick-settings tile for the app to connect or disconnect.
* Fix app showing that it was blocking connections when it wasn't when VPN permission was denied.
* Fix internet not working for a minute or two after changing Allow LAN setting.

#### Windows

* Fix log output encoding for Windows modules.
* Fix app not appearing on top in some situations when pressing the tray icon.
* Fix memory leak in Windows firewall code.

#### Linux

* Stop reconnecting when using WireGuard and NetworkManager.
* Reset DNS config correctly when the tunnel monitor unexpectedly goes down.
* Set search domains in NetworkManager's DNS configuration, resolving issues where NetworkManager
  is used to manage DNS via systemd-resolved.
* Fix incorrect version string in .deb installer causing downgrade warnings when upgrading from beta
  to stable.
* Fix memory leak in firewall code via updating `nftnl` dependency.
* Handle IPv6 traffic correctly using `mullvad-exclude` when there is no default route to any
  non-tunnel interface.
* Fix issues managing DNS when dnsmasq is used with NetworkManager.
* Fix issues with managing kernel WireGuard device via NetworkManager.
* Disable NetworkManager's connectivity check before applying firewall rules to avoid triggering
  NetworkManager's
  [bug](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/issues/312#note_453724)

### Security

* Restore the last target state if the daemon crashes. Previously, if auto-connect and
  "Always require VPN" were disabled, the service would reset the firewall upon starting back up,
  even if the tunnel was up when the crash occurred.
* Add firewall rules for `mullvad-exclude`, i.e. split tunneling, that disallow all traffic in the
  tunnel other than non-custom DNS traffic. This prevents leaks into the tunnel.
* Force OpenVPN to use TLS 1.3 or newer.

#### Windows

* Block all traffic received or sent before the BFE service and daemon service have started during
  boot, if "Always require VPN" or auto-connect is enabled.

## [2020.7] - 2020-11-18

This release is identical to 2020.7-beta2.
This release has no differences for Windows and macOS compared to 2020.6

## [2020.7-beta2] - 2020-11-16

This release is for desktop only. It only has changes for Linux

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Parse routes more permissively and log parsing errors less verbosely.

## [2020.7-beta1] - 2020-11-10

This release is for desktop only. It only has changes for Linux

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Order routes by prefix size in ascending order when applying them.
  Fixes an issue where seemingly manually added routes would be returned
  from the kernel in an order which can't be applied.
* If possible, use NetworkManager to create a WireGuard interface so that DNS can be managed
  via NetworkManager as well. This fixes the issue where the daemon will reconnect
  spuriously when using NetworkManager and WireGuard.
* Fix route parsing bug in route monitor by ignoring loopback routes.
* Apply DNS config quicker when managing DNS via NetworkManager.
* When NetworkManager is managing /etc/resolv.conf but ultimately using systemd-resolved, use
  systemd-resolved directly to manage DNS.
* Only use WireGuard kernel implementation if DNS isn't managed via NetworkManager.

## [2020.6] - 2020-10-20

This release is for desktop only.

This release is identical to 2020.6-beta3 except updated GUI translations

## [2020.6-beta3] - 2020-10-06

This release is for desktop only.

### Added

#### Linux

* Add support for WireGuard's kernel module if it's loaded.
* Add tray context menu with actions.

### Changed

#### Linux

* Open and focus app when opened from context menu instead of toggling the window.

### Fixed

* Start key rotation when WireGuard key is first created.
* Remove firewall filters (unblock internet access) when "Always require VPN" is enabled and the app
  is uninstalled.

#### Android

* Fix rare crash that could happen when starting the background service.
* Fix rare crash that happened with large text sizes and long location names on the main screen.
* Fix UI not updating in split screen mode when the window is unfocused.
* Fix split tunneling not being correctly configured after restarting the app.
* Fix app reopening after pressing the Quit button because app was running multiple tasks.
* Fix inconsistent behavior of the quick-settings tile when logged out. It would sometimes enter the
  blocking state and sometimes open the UI for the user to login. Now it always opens the UI.
* Mark the VPN connection as not metered, so that Android properly reports if the connection is or
  isn't metered based solely on the underlying network, and not on the VPN connection.

#### Linux

* Fix split tunneling rules preventing `systemd-resolved` from performing DNS lookups for excluded
  processes.
* Honor routes other than the default route with `mullvad-exclude`. This is mainly to improve
  routing within LANs.

### Security

* Stop resetting the firewall after an upgrade to not leak after an upgrade.

## [2020.6-beta2] - 2020-08-27

This release is for Android only.

### Added

* Add CLI command to set the location constraint via `mullvad relay set relay HOSTNAME`.
* Add a provider relay constraint, which restricts relay selection to a given hosting provider.
* Include hosting providers in the CLI for `mullvad relay list` and `mullvad bridge list`.

### Changed

* Use gRPC for communication between frontends and the backend instead of JSON-RPC.
* Show a warning in the CLI if the provided location constraints don't match any known relay.

### Fixed

* Fix high CPU usage in 2020.6-beta1. This was due to an incorrectly initialized stream in the
  relay list updater.
* Fix the relay list not being updated in 2020.6-beta1 after the daemon has started.

#### Android

* Fix possible crash when starting the app, caused by trying to use JNI functions before the library
  is loaded.
* Fix crash when selecting the whole text entered for the voucher code and then deleting it in the
  Redeem Voucher dialog.
* Show "Exclude applications" header if needed when entering the "Split tunneling" screen.
* Fix check for update versions and check for support for current version.
* Fix crash that could happen when leaving the Select Location screen.
* Don't show out-of-time notification for newly created accounts.

## [2020.6-beta1] - 2020-08-20

This release is for Android only.

### Added

* Show system notification when account has expired.
* Add fish shell completions for the mullvad CLI.
* Reconnect with a new key when WireGuard key is rotated automatically, previously the tunnel would
  time out before reconnecting.

#### Linux

* Add split tunneling menu under advanced settings in Linux app.

#### Android

* Add split-tunnelling, allowing apps to be configured to be excluded from the tunnel.
* Add localized app messages.

### Changed

* Upgrade from Electron 7 to Electron 8.
* Change version string parsing to never suggest the user to upgrade to an older version.
* Make connectivity checker more resilient to suspension.
* Make uninstaller on desktop platforms attempt to remove WireGuard keys from accounts.
* Make important notifications not timeout on macOS and remain in the notification list on Linux.
* Add exponential backoff to relay list downloader.

* Changed how the Select Location screen scrolls so that more items can be viewed at the same time.

#### Windows

* Upgrade Wintun from 0.7 to 0.8.1.
* Display causes of firewall errors in the GUI.

#### Linux

* Allow users to specify `net_cls` controller mountpoint via `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR`. The
  specified mountpoint will only be used if the controller isn't mounted already.

### Fixed

* Fix connectivity monitor for WireGuard not disconnecting from a relay when connectivity is lost.
* Forward firewall errors to the GUI in the connecting state, instead of showing a generic message
  about failing to start the tunnel.

#### Windows

* Fix window flickering by disabling window animations.
* Fix WireGuard not connecting if IPv6 is disabled in the adapter or OS. `libwg` would time out
  waiting for an IPv6 interface to become available.

#### Android

* Fix Connect screen sometimes becoming unusually tall. This ended up causing the screen to be
  scrolled up and made the UI elements unable to be seen until the user scrolled down.
* Fix connect action from quick-settings tile or notification sometimes opening the UI instead of
  connecting.
* Fix notification sometimes not being dismissible.
* Fix toggle switch sometimes getting stuck.

#### Linux

* Fix `systemd-resolved` DNS management by not parsing `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* Fix issue where DNS configuration would not be reset when NetworkManager was used and the daemon
  was stopped ungracefully. This persisted after reboots.

## [2020.5] - 2020-06-25

### Added

* Add Korean, Polish and Thai languages to the desktop app.

## [2020.5-beta2] - 2020-06-16

### Added

#### Android

* Add buttons to buy credit and redeem voucher in Account screen.
* Show a notification banner warning when the account time will soon run out.

### Changed

* Send an ICMP reject message or TCP reset packet when blocking outgoing packets to prevent
  timeouts.

#### macOS

* Use `SCNetworkReachability` to help determine connectivity of host. Helps bring the app online
  faster when the computer wakes up from sleep.

#### Android

* Show the remaining account time in the Settings screen in days if it's less than 3 months.
* Prevent commands to connect or disconnect to be sent when the device is locked.
* Make all screens scrollable to better handle small screens and split-screen mode.

### Fixed

* Show both WireGuard and OpenVPN servers in location list when protocol is set to automatic on
  Linux and macOS.
* Fix missing in app notification about unsupported version.
* Prevent auto-connect on login if the account is out of time.
* Fix race that caused WireGuard key upload to fail which could cause the "too many keys" error and
  the tunnel to invalidly fall back to OpenVPN.

#### Android

* Fix crash when that happened sometimes when the app tried to start the daemon service on recent
  Android versions.
* Fix quitting the app sometimes failing.
* Fix WireGuard key status events being lost by the UI, causing stale information to be shown.
* Fix time left in account not showing in settings screen.
* Fix attempt to connect when the app doesn't have the VPN permission.
* Fix crash that happened sometimes when the WireGuard key was loaded too quickly.
* Fix crash when entering split-screen mode whilst on the Report a Problem screen.
* Fix invalid back stack history when connection to service is lost and the app returns to the
  launch screen.
* Fix app leaving settings screen when entering split-screen mode.
* Fix app sometimes leaving Welcome screen prematurely after creating an account.

#### Windows

* Fix race in network adapter monitor that could result in data corruption and crashes.
* Upgrade `miow` dependency to stop daemon from crashing when the management interface named pipes
  were accessed with `accesschk.exe` and some web browsers.
* Fix race that may rarely occur during install when obtaining the GUID of a newly created TAP
  adapter.

### Security

* Tighten the firewall rules that were allowing traffic to the relay server over the physical
  network interface. On Linux and macOS now only processes running under root are allowed to send
  traffic to this port and IP. On Windows only the Mullvad VPN binaries are allowed to send.
  This fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-002`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).

#### Windows

* Tighten the firewall rule allowing traffic on port 53 to the relay server IP on the physical
  interfaces if the VPN tunnel is established on port 53 to only allow UDP. This fixes
  audit ticket [`MUL-02-004`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues).
* Deny access to the management interface named pipe for the `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK` group.
  This makes the named pipe no longer accessible under the `IPC$` network share.
  This fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-007`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).

#### Android

* Ignore touch events when another view is shown on top of the app in order to prevent tapjacking
  attacks. Fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-003`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues).
* Prevent screens showing potentially sensitive data from being recorded. Fixes audit
  ticket [`MUL-02-003`](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues).

## [2020.5-beta1] - 2020-05-18

### Added

* Add a new Let's Encrypt root certificate.

#### Android

* Add possibility to create account from the login screen.
* Add welcome screen for newly created accounts.
* Allow submitting voucher codes to add time to the account.
* Add Out Of Time screen for user to add more time to account once it expires.

### Changed

* Move location of the account data (including the WireGuard keys), so that it isn't lost when the
  system cache is cleaned.
* Rename "Block when disconnected" setting to "Always require VPN" and add additional explanation
  of the setting.
* Embed TLS certificates used for HTTPS into the binary rather than loading them from disk at
  runtime.
* Ignore case when setting the relay or bridge location in the CLI.
* Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.8 to 2.4.9 and the OpenSSL version it uses from 1.1.1d to 1.1.1g.
* Upgrade shadowsocks-rust to version 1.8.10.
* Always enable the beta program when running a beta version.
* Increase relay list download failure retry interval from 5 to 15 minutes. And from 5 seconds
  to 15 minutes for the WireGuard key rotation retry interval.

#### Android

* Adjust the minimum supported Android version to correctly reflect the supported versions decided
  in 2020.4-beta2. The app will now only install on Android 7 and later (API level 24).

### Fixed

#### Android

* Fix crash when leaving WireGuard Key screen while key is still verifying.
* Fix crash that sometimes happens right after some other unrelated crash.
* Fix app not connecting when pressing the notification or quick-settings tile when the service
  isn't running. It would previously just open the app UI and stay in the disconnected state.
* Fix crash when requesting to connect from notification or quick-settings tile.
* Fix version update notifications not appearing.
* Fix UI losing any settings updates that happen after leaving the app and then coming back.
* Fix account expiration date disappearing in some circumstances.
* Fix notification reappearing after quitting the application.
* Retry when fetching account expiration fails.

## [2020.4] - 2020-05-12

This release is identical to 2020.4-beta4

## [2020.4-beta4] - 2020-05-06

### Fixed

* Fix bogus or absent update notifications on the desktop app due to incorrect deserialization of a
  struct sent from the daemon.

#### Android

* App will now use packaged relay list if it's newer than the cached one.
* Fix relay list sort order.

#### Windows

* Remove all log files on uninstall. Clear install.log on upgrades.

## [2020.4-beta3] - 2020-04-29

### Added

* Add shell completions for the mullvad CLI. Installed for bash and zsh on Linux and zsh on macOS.

### Changed

* Downgrade to Electron 7 due to issues with tray icon in Electron 8.
* Use rustls instead of OpenSSL for TLS encryption to the API and GeoIP location service.

#### Windows

* When required, attempt to enable IPv6 for network adapters instead of failing.

#### Android

* Update the WireGuard Key screen so that it looks the same as on the desktop app. It is now reached
  through the Advanced settings screen.

### Fixed

* Enable IPv6 in WireGuard regardless of the specified MTU value, previously IPv6 was disabled if
  the MTU was below 1380.

#### Windows

* Improve offline detection logic.
* Enable missing IPv6 interface on the WireGuard TUN adapter when it has been disabled.

#### Android

* Change button colors on problem report no email confirmation dialog to match the desktop version.
* Fix crash when attempting to run app from the non-default location, such as the SD card or from a
  different user profile.

### Security

#### macOS

* Ship native Node modules unpacked to prevent malware checks by macOS on each run. The malware
  checks delayed app startup when "block when disconnected" was enabled and performed system network
  requests to Apple.

#### Android

* Fix failure to create tunnel when app is started with auto-connect enabled. This would sometimes
  lead to a traffic leak.

## [2020.4-beta2] - 2020-04-08

### Added

* Add possibility to create account in the desktop app.
* Add possibility to pay with voucher in the desktop app.

#### Android

* Add WireGuard MTU setting.

### Changed

* Allow `fc00::/7` instead of `fd00::/8` in the firewall when local network sharing is enabled.
  Should unblock all unique local addresses.
* Upgrade from Electron 7 to Electron 8.
* Formalize what operating system versions we support in the [readme](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/README.md). In practice
  this means dropped support for Android 5 and 6 and Fedora 28 and 29 right away, Ubuntu 16.04
  support will end as soon as Ubuntu 20.04 comes out.

#### Windows

* Windows 7 only: Address packet loss issues with OpenVPN on some systems by reverting the TAP
  adapter driver to an older NDIS 5 driver.

## [2020.4-beta1] - 2020-03-30

### Added

* Add signal handlers on Linux, macOS and Android to better log critical faults with the daemon.
* Add WireGuard MTU setting to desktop app.
* Add option to receive notifications about new beta releases.

#### Android

* Add option to enable auto-connecting behavior
* Include an initial relay list in the APK so that the app can connect to the VPN even if it fails
  to connect to the API after it is installed.
* Add a reconnect button to disconnect and connect again without closing the tunnel device to avoid
  leaking any data during the reconnection.
* Add quick settings tile to control the tunnel state.
* Enable IPv6 traffic through the tunnel.

### Changed

* Prefer WireGuard when tunnel protocol is set to *auto* on Linux and MacOS.
* Wait for tunnel state machine to properly shut down, cleaning up the firewall properly on Windows
  during the daemon shutdown.
* Switch to new logo.
* Show better message when the app failed to block all connections after an error.

### Fixed

* Fix bug that could lead to Javascript error dialog to appear upon the desktop app termination.
* Fix rendering glitch in the map and improve the map's resource usage.

#### macOS

* Fix firewall rules to properly handle DNS requests over TCP when "Local network sharing" is
  disabled. Previously DNS requests over TCP would timeout.

#### Android

* Fix notification action button not working when requesting to connect the tunnel after being
  disconnected for a long time.
* Make the settings screen scrollable, so that the quit button is reachable on small screens.
* Fix connectivity listener leak causing possible battery usage increase.
* Fix crash that could sometimes happen when restarting the background service.
* Fix incorrect location information sometimes shown in main screen.

#### Windows

* Fix bug where failing to initialize the route manager could cause the daemon to get stuck in a
  blocked state. This only affected WireGuard.

### Security

* When upgrading or reinstalling while connected, exit the daemon in a blocking state to prevent
  unintended leaks. This only affects upgrades from this release.

#### Windows

* Fix issue in daemon where the `block_when_disconnected` setting was sometimes not honored when
  stopping the daemon. I.e. traffic could flow freely after the daemon was stopped.

#### Android

* Fix issue where IPv6 traffic could leak outside of the tunnel.

## [2020.3] - 2020-02-20

This release is identical to 2020.3-beta1

## [2020.3-beta1] - 2020-02-20

### Security

* Fix stack overflow caused by WireGuard key rotation timers. When the daemon crashed it was
  restarted automatically. But it did not connect (depending on settings), leaving a leak.

## [2020.2] - 2020-02-13

This release is identical to 2020.2-beta1

## [2020.2-beta1] - 2020-02-13

### Added

* Add reconnect button to the desktop app.
* Add monochrome option for the tray icon on Windows and Linux.
* Show OS notification when account is close to expiry on desktop platforms.
* Warn users running old app versions when creating problem report.

#### Android

* Add option to enable or disable local network sharing.
* Show account history in login fragment

### Changed

* Change project copyright and company name from Amagicom AB to Mullvad VPN AB
* Only reconnect when settings change if a relevant tunnel protocol is used.
* Adjust padding of tray icon on Windows and Linux to better match other icons.
* Change the zoomlevel of the map in the desktop app to make it less zoomed in.
* Bundle new API IP with the app (Old: 193.138.218.73, new: 193.138.218.78)

### Removed

* Remove city/country labels on map in the desktop app.

### Fixed

* Fix app sometimes getting stuck in connecting state when using WireGuard.

#### Android

* Fix crash when removing the service from foreground on Android versions below API level 24.
* Fix crash that happened in certain situations when retrieving the relay list.
* Fix crash caused by initialization race condition.

#### Windows

* Fix "exhausted namespace" installation error on some non-English systems.

### Security

* Stop DNS leak that could happen on all desktop platforms if "Local network sharing" was enabled
  and the device had a default DNS resolver on the local private network. The leak could happen
  during these states: While connecting, when blocked due to an error happening and when
  disconnected if the "block when disconnected" setting was enabled.
  This issue has been present on all previous versions of the app.

#### Windows

* Prevent DNS leak that could happen while connected if "Local network sharing" was enabled
  and the device had a default DNS resolver on the local private network. This issue was
  only present in the 2020.1 release.

## [2020.1] - 2020-02-10

This release is identical to 2020.1-beta1

## [2020.1-beta1] - 2020-02-05

### Added

* Add translations for Finnish and Danish.
* Copy WireGuard key when clicking on it.

#### Windows

* Sign all binaries in the app instead of just the installer.

### Changed

* Increase OpenVPN ping timeout from 20 to 25 seconds. Might make working tunnels disconnect
  a bit less frequently.
* Use traffic data from WireGuard to infer connectivity, instead of continuously pinging.
  Should improve stability of the connection and reduce power use.
* Update `wireguard-go` to `v0.0.20200121`
* Remove WireGuard keys from accounts when they are removed from the local account history.
* Upgrade from Electron 6 to Electron 7.
* Disable WireGuard protocol option if there's no WireGuard key.

#### Android

* Wait for traffic to be routed through the tunnel device before advertising blocked state.
* Connect automatically if `MullvadVpnService` is started with an intent which
  has the `android.net.VpnService` action. Effectively, this should enable
  *Always On* behavior on Android versions where it's supported.
* Allow notification to be dismissed when the UI is not shown and the tunnel is disconnected.

#### Windows

* Use a branded TAP driver for OpenVPN to prevent conflicts with other software and solve issues
  related to driver upgrades. Also use the NDIS 6 driver on Windows 7.
* Be more aggressive when installing routes, in effect taking ownership of existing duplicate route
  entries. This allows the daemon to initialize properly even if a previous instance did not have a
  clean shutdown.

### Fixed

* Don't try to replace WireGuard key if account has too many keys already.
* Fix bogus update notification caused by an outdated cache.
* Fix layout issues when showing messages in WireGuard key view.
* Fix translation of "System default" after selecting "System default" in language settings.

#### Windows

* Fix regression due to which a TAP adapter issue was not given as the specific block reason when
  the tunnel could not be started.
* Fix occasional failure to shut down the old daemon process during installation by killing it if
  necessary.
* Make WireGuard work with IPv6 enabled even if there is no functioning TAP adapter for OpenVPN.
* Restart daemon when coming back from system hibernation with terminated user session, since
  it's perceived as a cold boot from the user's perspective, so the app should act accordingly.
* Change the optimization level for releases from the default value to `s`, as a temporary fix for
  the system service crashing on Windows for newer CPU models.

#### Android

* Fix notification message to not show `null` version when version check cache is stale right
  after an update.
* Fix `null` pointer exception when connectivity event intent has no network info.
* Fix fast loop trying to fetch location and preventing the device from sleeping. This should
  improve battery life in some cases.
* Fix crash when starting the app right after quitting it.
* Restart background service if it stops responding.
* Fix crash when VPN permission is revoked, either manually or by starting another VPN app.
* Fix crash caused by local JNI reference table overflow after running for a long time.
* Dismiss notification after service has stopped.
* Don't show missing connectivity error message in WireGuard key management screen if a
  reconnection is expected to happen.
* Fix showing new key as invalid immediately after regeneration.

#### Linux

* DNS management with static `/etc/resolv.conf` will now work even when no
  `/etc/resolv.conf` exists.

### Security

* Add automatic key rotation for WireGuard (every 7 days by default). This limits the potential
  for an attacker to correlate traffic with a public key and identity, and reduces the harm of
  software that might leak the private tunnel IP (since it is no longer fixed).

#### Windows

* Stop OpenVPN from loading `C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf` on start. This file was being loaded when an
  OpenVPN tunnel was being created. Any user could create the file, and the process loading it runs
  as the SYSTEM user. Since the config file allows loading arbitrary code, it was an attack vector
  allowing local unprivileged users to run code as SYSTEM.

#### macOS

* Limit macOS firewall rules to only allow UDP packets in the rules meant to enable being a DHCPv4
  *server* when local network sharing is enabled.

## [2019.10] - 2019-12-12

### Fixed

* Fix improved WireGuard port selection.

#### Windows

* Register 'NSI' service as a dependency of the daemon service.
* Set daemon service SID type as 'unrestricted'.
* Properly tear down routes after disconnecting from WireGuard relays.
* Fix bug that prohibited WireGuard from working over port 53.

### Security

#### Linux

* Stop [CVE-2019-14899](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/122) by dropping all packets destined
  for the tunnel IP coming in on some other interface than the tunnel.

## [2019.10-beta2] - 2019-12-05

### Added

* Add `mullvad relay set tunnel-protocol` subcommand to the CLI to specify what tunnel protocol
  to use.
* Add `mullvad reconnect` subcommand to the CLI to make the app pick a new server and reconnect.

#### Windows

* Full WireGuard support, GUI and CLI.
* Install Wintun driver that provides the WireGuard TUN adapter.
* Remove Mullvad TAP adapter on uninstall. Also remove the TAP driver if there are no other TAP
  adapters in the system.

#### Android

* Add connectivity status check. Stopping the app from sitting in a reconnect loop while the
  device is offline.

### Changed

* Notifications shown when connecting to a server include its location.
* Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.7 to 2.4.8.
* Upgrade OpenSSL from 1.1.1c to 1.1.1d.
* When using WireGuard without specifying a specific relay port, port 53 will be used after 2
  failed connection attempts for 2 out of 4 each successive connection attempts

#### Windows

* Use a larger icon in notifications on Windows 10.
* Only update DNS settings if updating would change the effective settings. This is a work-around
  to avoid invoking `netsh` unnecessarily and getting stuck in associated hangs.
* Don't restart the service immediately if it aborts several times in a row. Leave a window of ten
  minutes to allow for addressing the issue.
* Upgrade libsodium from 1.0.17 to 1.0.18.
* Upgrade NDIS 6 TAP driver from 9.21.2 to 9.24.2.

### Fixed

#### Linux

* Improve stability on Linux by using the routing netlink socket in its own thread.
* When trying to use `resolvconf` for managing DNS, the daemon will check if
  `dnsmasq` is running and misconfigured.
* Improve stability on Linux by simplifying route management code.

#### Windows

* Detect removal of the OpenVPN TAP adapter on reconnection attempts.
* Improve robustness in path environment variable logic in Windows installer. Handle the case
  where the registry value type is incorrectly set to be a regular string rather than an expandable
  string.
* Fix suspend and resume issues with OpenVPN by upgrading the TAP driver.
* Minor adjustment in online/offline detection logic. This change addresses misbehaving drivers
  that report the adapter flags incorrectly.

#### Android

* Don't try to fetch location when the app knows that it has no connectivity. This should reduce
  wake-ups (improving battery life) and also fix very large log files consuming storage space.
* Fix crash when a new version event is received while the app is in the main screen.

### Security

* Force OpenVPN to use TLS 1.2 or newer, and limit the TLS 1.3 ciphers to only the strongest ones.
  The Mullvad servers have never allowed any insecure ciphers, so this was not really a problem.
  Just one extra safety precaution.

## [2019.10-beta1] - 2019-11-06

This release is for Android only.

### Added

#### Android

* Use authenticated URLs to go to wireguard key page on website.
* WireGuard key fragment has been made more similar to its desktop counterpart.

### Fixed

* Fix bad file descriptor errors caused by sending a file descriptor between the daemon and the
  `wireguard-go` library.
* Recreate tun device after a fixed number of connection attempts on the same tun device. Breaks
  infinite reconnection loops on broken tun devices.

## [2019.9] - 2019-10-11

### Added

* Add ability to submit vouchers from the CLI.

#### Linux

* Add a symlink for `mullvad-problem-report` directly in `/usr/bin`. So the tool is available.

#### Windows

* Install the OpenVPN certificate to avoid the TAP adapter driver installation warning on
  Windows 8 and newer.

### Changed

#### Windows

* Rename the `problem-report` tool to `mullvad-problem-report`.

### Fixed

* Fix Norwegian (Bokmal) language detection.
* Fix missing localizations when formatting date and time in Norwegian (Bokmal).
* Use authenticated URL to go to account page from expired account view.

#### macOS

* Remove `mullvad` and `mullvad-problem-report` symlinks from `/usr/local/bin` on uninstall.

## [2019.9-beta1] - 2019-10-08

#### Android

* Remove connect action button in notification when logged out.

### Fixed

* Fix `mullvad relay update` to trigger a relay list download even if the existing cache is new.
* Don't include problem-report arguments in error logging. Stops user email from ending up in the
  log file on error.
* Fix handling of tunnel file descriptor for WireGuard. Duplicating and closing it correctly.

#### Android

* Show WireGuard key age in local timezone instead of UTC.
* Android 6 and older: Fix notification button icons.
* Fix collapsing tunnel information causing tunnel out IP address information to be lost.
* Various stability fixes.

* Prevent possible reconnect loop where the GUI would indefinitely reconnect to the daemon.
* Fix the bug which enabled users to return to the login view if they went to settings while
  logging in.
* Handle in the GUI, if something external changes the account token in the daemon. I.e. triggered
  by CLI unsetting or resetting it.

#### Linux

* Fix Debian package not upgrading properly due to a bug in the post-remove script.
* Wait for NetworkManager and systemd-resolved services to start before daemon starts on platforms
  with systemd and those two services. Prevents the daemon from using the wrong DNS API.

#### Windows

* Use proper app id in the registry. This avoids false-positives with certain anti-virus software.
* Handle sleep/resume events to quickly restore the tunnel when the machine wakes up.
* Add default route to fix NLA issues (Microsoft Store/Office/etc say the machine is offline).
* Update installer to not rely on WMI when enumerating network adapters.
* Increase timeout waiting for OpenVPN to shut down cleanly.
* Sign the bundled openvpn.exe binary. Should make some anti-virus software complain less.

### Fixed

* Fix so changing the OpenVPN mssfix setting triggers setting up a new tunnel with the new setting.

## [2018.4-beta3] - 2018-10-12

### Fixed

* Place Mssfix setting inside scrollable area.
* Fix so mssfix can be unset. Previously emptying the textbox did nothing.

#### Linux

* The app will have its window resized correctly when display scaling settings are changed. This

  with compression.

### Fixed

#### Windows

* Use different method for identifying network interfaces during installation. Should solve some
  installation errors.
* Properly restore DNS settings on network interfaces. Fixes issue #352.

## [2018.4-beta1] - 2018-10-01

### Added

* Allow packets to the fe80::/10 and fe02::/16 IPv6 networks when local network sharing is enabled.
  Should allow IPv6 over the LAN, and mDNS host discovery which in turn should allow Apple AirDrop
  and Handover among other IPv6 based LAN discovery services.

#### Linux

  fixes [MUL-01-001](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues)

## [2018.3] - 2018-09-17

### Changed

#### macOS

* Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) back into the `Resources/` directory. A bug caused the app to not
  be signed if it was placed in the app root directory.

### Security

#### Windows

* Lock the installation directory to `C:\Program Files\Mullvad VPN`. This prevents potential local
  privilege escalation by ensuring all binaries executed by the `SYSTEM` user, as part of the
  Mullvad system service, are stored where unprivileged users can't modify them. This fixes
  [MUL-01-004](/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/blob/main/audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).

## [2018.3-beta1] - 2018-09-13

* Make scrollbar thumb draggable.
* Ability to expand cities with multiple servers and configure the app to use a specific server.
* Add firewall rules allowing traffic to the SSDP/WS-discover multicast IP, 239.255.255.250, if
  local area network sharing is activated. This allows discovery of devices using these protocols.

#### macOS

* Add uninstall script that can uninstall and remove all the files installed by the app.

#### Windows

* Extend uninstaller to also remove logs, cache and optionally settings.
* Add installation log (%PROGRAMDATA%\Mullvad VPN\install.log).

### Changed

* The "Buy more credit" button is changed to open a dedicated account login page instead of one
  having a create account form first.
* The CLI command to list relays is now shorter, `mullvad relay list` instead of
  `mullvad relay list locations`.
* Replace WebSockets with Unix domain sockets/Named pipes for IPC. The location
  of the socket can be controlled with `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`.
* Update the relay list if it's out of date when the daemon starts.
* Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) on macOS and Linux up one level, so it's installed directly into
  the app installation directory instead of the `resource` directory.

### Fixed

* Fix incorrect window position when using external display.
* Don't auto-connect the daemon on start if no account token is set. This prevents the daemon from
  blocking all internet if logging out from the app.

#### Linux

* The app window is now shown in its previous location, instead of at the center of the screen.
* Remove daemon log, cache and configuration directories during full uninstallation of the app.
* Restart the daemon automatically on upgrade.

#### macOS

* Fix edge cases when window's arrow appeared misaligned and pointed to the wrong menubar item.
* Make the pkg installer kill any running GUI process after installation is done. Prevents
  accidentally running an old GUI with a newer daemon.

#### Windows

* Failing to restore DNS settings on daemon start does not make the daemon exit with an error, just
  log the error and continue.

## [2018.2] - 2018-08-13

This release is identical to 2018.2-beta3

## [2018.2-beta3] - 2018-08-09

### Added

* Create a new UI log file for every UI execution session, and preserve the log from the previous
  session.

  roaming user directory.
* Where the system service would use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad\Mullvad VPN\` it now just uses
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad VPN\`

### Fixed

* Ignore empty strings as redaction requests in the problem report tool, to avoid adding redacted
  markers between every character of the log message.
* Previously logged in users won't be going through login view when restarting the app, instead
  will be taken straight to main view.

  green lock with a red dot.
* While connecting, a message telling the user that internet access is blocked is shown.
* Default to selecting servers in Sweden to increase the likelihood of a fast and stable connection.
* Scrollbars will automatically hide when not scrolling.

### Removed

* Remove the unsafe Camellia and Seed ciphers from the list of allowed OpenVPN ciphers.

## [2017.1-beta7] - 2017-12-13

### Added

* Buffer size and fast-io parameters to OpenVPN. Can double the speed on high latency connections.
* Download a list of our current servers on startup, instead of having a bundled list of servers in
  the app that does not receive updates.
* Backup account numbers in a file so that they are harder to lose.
* Include the OpenVPN log in the problem report. IP addresses and MAC addresses are redacted before
  the logs are sent.

### Fixed

* Hold off notifying the frontend of the 'unsecure' state until the VPN tunnel is actually
  completely disconnected.
* Show the VPN GUI on all macOS workspaces, not only the one where it was started.

### Changed

* Renamed daemon binary from `mullvadd` to `mullvad-daemon`.

### Security

* DNS leak found when using redirect firewall rules and a custom DNS forwarder. Replaced all of that
  with strict DNS blocking firewall rules and SystemConfiguration integration where DNS settings are
  injected to the operating system settings and constantly monitored for external changes.

## [2017.1-beta6] - 2017-11-09

### Added

* Possibility to shut down the daemon via an RPC call.
* Problem reports, for collecting and sending app logs to Mullvad support. This is fully opt-in
  and must be triggered by the user.
* Possibility to change between UDP and TCP as well as select port for OpenVPN to use.
* Possibility to copy the account number in the field where it's displayed in the GUI.

### Changed

* Escape shell arguments better in both backend daemon and GUI.
* Rename the macOS PF firewall anchor created by the program to "mullvad".
* Change settings format from toml to json. To enable storing more advanced settings types.

### Fixed

* Shut down the backend daemon when quitting the app from the GUI. It was previously kept alive.
* Sign the macOS binaries with SHA1 in addition to SHA256. Enables running on 10.9 and 10.10.

## [2017.1-beta5] - 2017-10-17

### Changed

* Upgrade the OpenVPN plugin to reduce risk of panics

### Fixed

* Change log level to reduce log file size
* Introduce minimum delay between failed VPN tunnel connections, to reduce load on the computer in
  special cases

### Security

* Authenticate RPC connections towards the backend
* Reject revoked server certificates

## [2017.1-beta4] - 2017-10-05

Nothing of interest

## [2017.1-beta3] - 2017-10-05

### Added

* Automatically secure connection on login

### Changed

* Upgrade JSON-RPC library for more stable communication to our account server
* Remove the auto-secure setting
* Show the destination country while securing the connection
* Clean up the server list

### Fixed

* No longer clear the account token input field when navigating to and from the settings
* Show the main UI window on start when the user is not logged in

## [2017.1-beta2] - 2017-09-27

### Added

* Support for removing the account number from the CLI.

### Changed

* Improved logging in the frontend in case of backend communication failure.

### Fixed

* Fix logout bug not removing the account number correctly.
* Don't show city and country in the frontend when tunnel is not connected.
* Don't try to automatically establish a tunnel from the frontend if the login failed.

## [2017.1-beta1] - 2017-09-27

### Added

* Initial closed beta release. Can set up a tunnel and protect against leaks on macOS.
