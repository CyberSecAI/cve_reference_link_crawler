- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Disabler plugin versions <= 3.0.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a cross-site request forgery, where a malicious request is sent to the vulnerable site from a different site, taking advantage of the user's authenticated session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a request that triggers the unwanted action. They do not need to be authenticated to the target website.
