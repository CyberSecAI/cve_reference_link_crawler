# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Are there consequences if `depth` is negative? How about `info_size`? etc.

Thanks

[@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) `info_size` and `depth` are both unsigned values in the file. In the case of `info_size`, the consequence of a 32-bit unsigned value being interpreted as a 32-bit signed value (when `int` is 32-bits) will be that the extra image information will not be skipped and you'll end up with bogus image data embedded in the output. For `depth` I only support specific values (1, 4, 8, and 24) - an unsupported value will result in a blank image. I should probably change this to return an error but it isn't critical.

Will this bogus data come from unrelated memory elsewhere in the process?
Or will it be a run of a few billion zeros? Or is it determinstically
derived from the inputs?
 For `depth` I only support specific values (1, 4, 8, and 24) - an

Cool cool, both approaches work well enough.

[@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) The bogus data comes from the file - this doesn't cause any weird memory accesses, it will just mean that the reader will look for colormap and image data inside the extra image information area and populate the pixel array accordingly. More than likely the output will contain a garbage rectangle but it will be safe garbage with no out-of-bounds memory accesses.

CVE ID         : CVE-2021-40985 CVE-2021-43579 CVE-2022-0534

```
Several issues have been found in htmldoc, an HTML processor that
generates indexed HTML, PS, and PDF.
```

CVE-2022-0534

     A crafted GIF file could lead to a stack out-of-bounds read,
     which could result in a crash (segmentation fault).

CVE-2021-43579

     Converting an HTML document, which links to a crafted BMP file,
     could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow, which could result
     in remote code execution.

CVE-2021-40985

     A crafted BMP image could lead to a buffer overflow, which could
     cause a denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v1.9.12...v1.9.13`

### **[00xc](/00xc)** commented [Nov 4, 2021](#issue-1044869365)

| In `image_load_bmp()`, the `colors_used` variable is read from the BMP file header and directly used to read into a fixed-size buffer.  ``` static int			/* O - 0 = success, -1 = fail */ image_load_bmp(image_t *img,	/* I - Image to load into */                FILE    *fp,	/* I - File to read from */ 	       int     gray,	/* I - Grayscale image? */                int     load_data)/* I - 1 = load image data, 0 = just info */ {   ...   uchar		colormap[256][4];   ...   colors_used      = read_dword(fp);   ...   fread(colormap, colors_used, 4, fp);   ... } ```  A maliciously crafted BMP file could set the `colors_used` variable to a number big enough to overflow the stack and thus the return address. I am attaching a proof of concept below. It can be tested with: `./htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf ./poc.html`  [poc.zip](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/files/7475732/poc.zip) |

### **[Voiddy-Dev](/Voiddy-Dev)** commented [Dec 11, 2021](#issue-1077479183)

| The fix for the issue [stack buffer overflow before 1.9.13](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/issues/453) does not completely protect against a stack buffer overflow in `image_load_bmp()`.  It is possible to control the read in buffer `colormap` through the `colors_used` variable. The previous fix does not mitigate the issue as the `color_used` is an `integer`, therefore, regardless of the `unsigned` return of `read_dword(fp)` the buffer can be overflowed.  ``` static int			/* O - 0 = success, -1 = fail */ image_load_bmp(image_t *img,	/* I - Image to load into */                FILE    *fp,	/* I - File to read from */ 	       int     gray,	/* I - Grayscale image? */                int     load_data)/* I - 1 = load image data, 0 = just info */ {   ...    uchar		colormap[256][4];   ...   colors_used      = (int)read_dword(fp);   ...   // Get colormap...   if (colors_used == 0 && depth <= 8)     colors_used = 1 << depth;   else if (colors_used > 256)  // colors_used => 0xffffff00 --> -0x100     return (-1);   ...   fread(colormap, colors_used, 4, fp);   ... }  ```  As an example, if `colors_used` is `0xffffff00` the if statement validates the variable and leads to a buffer overflow.  **Impact**   * This buffer overflow can lead to modifying the instruction pointer and can therefore lead to remote code execution.

| I'm beginning to think that the best solution for this is to drop BMP support entirely - it is a dead format and I've spent far more time fixing potential security issues than I'd like... |
