### **[Voiddy-Dev](/Voiddy-Dev)** commented [Dec 11, 2021](#issue-1077479183)

| The fix for the issue [stack buffer overflow before 1.9.13](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/issues/453) does not completely protect against a stack buffer overflow in `image_load_bmp()`.  It is possible to control the read in buffer `colormap` through the `colors_used` variable. The previous fix does not mitigate the issue as the `color_used` is an `integer`, therefore, regardless of the `unsigned` return of `read_dword(fp)` the buffer can be overflowed.  ``` static int			/* O - 0 = success, -1 = fail */ image_load_bmp(image_t *img,	/* I - Image to load into */                FILE    *fp,	/* I - File to read from */ 	       int     gray,	/* I - Grayscale image? */                int     load_data)/* I - 1 = load image data, 0 = just info */ {   ...    uchar		colormap[256][4];   ...   colors_used      = (int)read_dword(fp);   ...   // Get colormap...   if (colors_used == 0 && depth <= 8)     colors_used = 1 << depth;   else if (colors_used > 256)  // colors_used => 0xffffff00 --> -0x100     return (-1);   ...   fread(colormap, colors_used, 4, fp);   ... }  ```  As an example, if `colors_used` is `0xffffff00` the if statement validates the variable and leads to a buffer overflow.  **Impact**   * This buffer overflow can lead to modifying the instruction pointer and can therefore lead to remote code execution.

| I'm beginning to think that the best solution for this is to drop BMP support entirely - it is a dead format and I've spent far more time fixing potential security issues than I'd like... |
