### **[00xc](/00xc)** commented [Nov 4, 2021](#issue-1044869365)

| In `image_load_bmp()`, the `colors_used` variable is read from the BMP file header and directly used to read into a fixed-size buffer.  ``` static int			/* O - 0 = success, -1 = fail */ image_load_bmp(image_t *img,	/* I - Image to load into */                FILE    *fp,	/* I - File to read from */ 	       int     gray,	/* I - Grayscale image? */                int     load_data)/* I - 1 = load image data, 0 = just info */ {   ...   uchar		colormap[256][4];   ...   colors_used      = read_dword(fp);   ...   fread(colormap, colors_used, 4, fp);   ... } ```  A maliciously crafted BMP file could set the `colors_used` variable to a number big enough to overflow the stack and thus the return address. I am attaching a proof of concept below. It can be tested with: `./htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf ./poc.html`  [poc.zip](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/files/7475732/poc.zip) |
