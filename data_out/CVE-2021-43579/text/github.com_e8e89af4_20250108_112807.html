Are there consequences if `depth` is negative? How about `info_size`? etc.

Thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) `info_size` and `depth` are both unsigned values in the file. In the case of `info_size`, the consequence of a 32-bit unsigned value being interpreted as a 32-bit signed value (when `int` is 32-bits) will be that the extra image information will not be skipped and you'll end up with bogus image data embedded in the output. For `depth` I only support specific values (1, 4, 8, and 24) - an unsupported value will result in a blank image. I should probably change this to return an error but it isn't critical.

Will this bogus data come from unrelated memory elsewhere in the process?
Or will it be a run of a few billion zeros? Or is it determinstically
derived from the inputs?

Cool cool, both approaches work well enough.

[@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) The bogus data comes from the file - this doesn't cause any weird memory accesses, it will just mean that the reader will look for colormap and image data inside the extra image information area and populate the pixel array accordingly. More than likely the output will contain a garbage rectangle but it will be safe garbage with no out-of-bounds memory accesses.
