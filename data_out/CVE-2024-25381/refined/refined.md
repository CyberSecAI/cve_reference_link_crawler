Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of filtering/sanitization of user-provided content within the article publishing functionality of Emlog Pro 2.2.8. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered due to "non-filtering of quoted content" when an article is published.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected by an attacker are permanently stored on the server and executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the website.
    *   **Phishing:** Tricking users into providing login credentials or other sensitive information by displaying fake login forms or other UI elements.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the article publishing feature of Emlog Pro 2.2.8.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the body of an article being published.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when another user views the article content, especially on the home page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the Emlog Pro 2.2.8 system with the capability to publish articles. This position is required to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attacker used image links to demonstrate the issue, showing the steps to inject the payload and where the XSS is triggered.
*   The vulnerability is specifically located in the code that handles the display of article content, which does not filter the fetched content.
*   The vendor initially did not acknowledge the issue as a vulnerability.
*   The provided content includes github issue reporting the vulnerability and a file on a github repo further describing the vulnerability.
