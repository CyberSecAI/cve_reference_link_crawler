- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Product Recommendations plugin versions prior to 2.3.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs an action on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
