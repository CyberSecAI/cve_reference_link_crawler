Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check on the backend request that handles user banning in GitLab groups. While the UI correctly restricts the ability to ban users to group owners, a `Guest` user with a custom role having the "Admin group member" permission can bypass this restriction by directly sending a crafted backend request.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks on the backend when handling ban user requests. The system fails to verify that the user initiating the ban action has the necessary owner-level privileges.
    *   **Role Permission Bypass**: Although the UI prevents the user from performing the action, the API does not check for the required owner permissions, thus enabling a role permission bypass.
    *   **Inconsistent permission enforcement:** The UI enforces the correct permission while the backend does not.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A `Guest` user with the "Admin group member" custom role can ban any user within the group, including users with higher permissions (such as Maintainer), causing disruption and potentially hindering group operations.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves crafting a direct HTTP POST request to the `/groups/<group_path>/-/group_members/<user_id>/ban` endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain a valid `Cookie` and `authenticity_token` or `X-Csrf-Token` to authenticate the request and bypass CSRF protection.
    *   The attacker must know the target user's ID, which can be obtained from the HTML source of the group members page.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a `Guest` user with a custom role that has the `Admin group member` permission within the target group.
    *   The attacker needs access to a web browser or tool that can send HTTP requests, and to view the page source to extract user ids and tokens.
    *   The attacker does not need any special network access beyond what is required to access the GitLab instance.
