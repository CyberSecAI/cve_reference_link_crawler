Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary issue lies in the incorrect measurement of the config partition during the measured boot process. Specifically, PCR14, which is related to the config partition, is not included in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the "vault" key.
*   Additionally, the "vault" key is sealed/unsealed using SHA1 PCRs instead of the more secure SHA256 PCRs.
*   A code change introduced in commit `7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4` caused PCR14 to only update its SHA256 instance, while the "vault" key relies on SHA1 PCR values, leading to an inconsistency.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent PCR measurements:** PCR14 updates its SHA256 value, but the "vault" key uses SHA1 values.
*   **Use of weak hash:** The use of SHA1 for sealing/unsealing the "vault" key instead of SHA256 is a vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient protection of credentials:** The "vault" key, which likely protects sensitive information, is vulnerable due to the inconsistent PCR measurements.
*   **Insecure storage of sensitive information:** The "vault" key is not properly secured due to the measured boot process not correctly incorporating changes to the config partition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot process.
*   This allows the attacker to gain full control of the device.
*   The attacker also gains full access to the contents of the encrypted "vault," likely containing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access to the device.
*   Modification of the config partition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local access to the device is required.
*   Ability to modify the configuration partition.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was somewhat mitigated by the fact that PCR extend functions update both SHA256 and SHA1 values, but the commit mentioned above broke this for PCR14.
*   The provided CVSS score is 8.8, which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
*   The identified CWEs are: CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information).
*   The identified CAPEC is: CAPEC-115 (Authentication Bypass).
*   The affected product is EVE OS.
