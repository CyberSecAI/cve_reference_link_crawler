- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Applications using `spring-boot-loader` or `spring-boot-loader-classic` with custom signature verification of nested JAR files are vulnerable. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how signatures are handled, allowing a forged signature to appear valid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Signature forgery vulnerability in Spring Boot's loader. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an attacker to create a nested jar where content that appears to be signed by one entity is actually signed by another.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass signature verification checks and execute malicious code within an application by using a forged nested jar.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to create a crafted, nested JAR file that exploits the signature forgery vulnerability. The vulnerability is exploitable if an application performs custom signature verification on nested jar files
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to provide a modified nested jar file to the application. The attacker also needs to understand how the target application uses and verifies signed JAR files to successfully exploit the vulnerability. The attack is rated as low privilege and high attack complexity based on the provided CVSS score vector.
