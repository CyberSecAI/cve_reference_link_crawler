The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2741.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Bosch M_CAN driver back-end interrupt service routine. A crafted CAN frame with a mismatched RTR bit (Remote Transmission Request) compared to the filter will cause the driver's interrupt service routine to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The Bosch M_CAN driver back-end does not properly handle CAN frames with mismatched RTR bits relative to the configured filters.
- The lack of proper handling allows an attacker to cause an infinite loop in the interrupt service routine

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The affected MCU becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop, preventing it from further processing CAN messages, potentially impacting other connected devices, and it stops executing it's main program.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network - The attack is conducted by transmitting a specially crafted CAN frame on the same CAN network as the vulnerable node.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to transmit CAN frames on the same CAN network as the vulnerable node.
- The attacker needs to be able to determine (or guess) a valid CAN ID that matches a filter on the vulnerable node.
- The attacker must craft a CAN frame with a mismatched RTR bit compared to the filter in the target node.
