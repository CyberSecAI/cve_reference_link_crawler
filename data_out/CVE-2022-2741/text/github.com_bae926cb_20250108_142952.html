# can: denial-of-service can be triggered by a crafted CAN frame

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

During investigation of [#47204](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/47204) I discovered that this particular bug can be used for remote denial-of-service via CAN for MCUs using the Bosch M\_CAN driver back-end for CAN communication.

This driver back-end is used for at least the NXP LPCxpresso5500 series, the ST STM32H7 series, ST STM32G4 series, ST STM32U5 series, Atmel SAME70 series, and Atmel SAMV71 series.

The denial-of-service can be triggered by transmitting a carefully crafted CAN frame on the same CAN network as the vulnerable node. The frame must have a CAN ID matching an installed filter in the vulnerable node (this can easily be guessed based on CAN traffic analyses). The frame must

contain the opposite RTR bit as what the filter installed in the vulnerable node contains (if the filter matches RTR frames, the frame must be a data frame or vice versa).

This carefully crafted frame will cause the Bosch M\_CAN driver back-end interrupt service routine to enter an endless loop since the frame “wrongly" matching the filter is never acknowledged and thus keeps being read from the hardware FIFO.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
