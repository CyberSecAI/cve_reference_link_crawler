{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-6317",
      "Root cause": "The plugin lacks nonce validation and does not properly validate file paths before deletion within the `wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page` function.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "Inadequate file path validation",
        "Missing nonce validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, including critical files like `wp-config.php`. Successful exploitation can lead to site takeover and remote code execution.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a forged request. The attacker needs to trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link, to trigger the file deletion.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and needs a site administrator to interact with the crafted link/request. No user authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
