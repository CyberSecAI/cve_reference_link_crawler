Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type checking in the file saving endpoint (`/_api/image/save`) of Automad 2.0.0. While there was file extension validation during uploads, this validation was not present when the file was being saved.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation on the file saving endpoint, allowing an attacker to bypass the existing file extension checks during upload.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The lack of proper file type validation allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file disguised as an image, which can then be executed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*  **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, potentially giving the attacker full control over the server and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/image/save` endpoint.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The POST request contains a PHP file disguised as an image.
*   **File Execution:** The server saves the file without proper validation, and when accessed, the PHP code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/_api/image/save`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Request:** The attacker needs to craft a POST request containing a malicious PHP file disguised as an image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported as present in the image upload functionality, but it was later discovered the vulnerability was present in the file saving endpoint.
*   The reported PoC includes uploading a base64 encoded php file containing `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The issue was quickly fixed by implementing file type checking in the file saving endpoint and the fix was released soon after.
*  The issue is also tracked in the github advisory database [GHSA-47mc-qmh2-mqj4](https://github.com/advisory-database/pull/4699)
