### Vulnerability Analysis for CVE-2024-4706

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'pintra' shortcode of the WordPress + Microsoft Office 365 / Azure AD | LOGIN plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the 'pintra' shortcode attributes, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately clean the input received through the shortcode attributes.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly encode the output, allowing the injected script to execute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.
- **Compromise of User Data:** The injected scripts can potentially steal sensitive user information, perform actions on behalf of users, or redirect them to malicious sites.
- **Site Defacement:** Attackers may alter the content or appearance of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **'pintra' shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered by inserting malicious scripts within the attributes of the 'pintra' shortcode.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored within the database and executed each time the affected page is loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit content where the malicious shortcode can be included.
