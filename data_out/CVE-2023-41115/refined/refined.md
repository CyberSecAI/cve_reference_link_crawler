- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permission checks when using `UTL_ENCODE` in EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An authenticated user can bypass intended permission controls and read any large object. This is a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information by reading large objects the user does not have permission to access.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via the `UTL_ENCODE` function, accessible by any authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
