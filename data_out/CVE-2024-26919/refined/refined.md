The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26919.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The debugfs directory for ULPI (USB Low Pin Interface) devices was being created using the parent device's name, while the unregistration process attempted to remove a directory named after the ULPI device itself. This discrepancy caused the debugfs directory to persist after the ULPI device was unregistered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect debugfs directory naming during creation and removal.
- Failure to properly clean up debugfs resources during device unregistration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The leftover debugfs directory prevents subsequent (deferred) probes of the same ULPI device from succeeding.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through normal device registration and unregistration flows.
- No specific user interaction is required to trigger the bug.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker doesn't need a specific position or capabilities other than being able to trigger ULPI device registration and unregistration on the system.
