## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Swift Framework < 2024.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. As a contributor, go to "Swift Slider > Add New Slide"
2. In the "Content > Caption Text" add the POC: `[spb\_boxed\_content element\_name="red" title=""test" box\_link="red"" box\_link\_target="self" el\_class='red" onmouseover="alert(/XSScontrib5/)"' width='1/1' el\_position="first last"]test content[/spb\_boxed\_content]`
3. When an admin approves the slide, the XSS will be seen.
Note: Other shortcodes throughout the plugin are vulnerable to the same issue.

### Description

The Swift Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode(s) in all versions up to 2024.0.0 (exclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
