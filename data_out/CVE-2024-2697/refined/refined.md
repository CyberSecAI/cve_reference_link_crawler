Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes within its shortcodes before outputting them on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization.
- Inadequate output escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute when a user accesses the compromised page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Data theft.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the plugin's shortcodes.
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript via the attributes of vulnerable shortcodes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least "Contributor" level access or higher.
- They can inject malicious shortcode attributes when creating content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Swift Framework" plugin prior to version 2024.0.0.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject the malicious payload through the "Caption Text" field when adding a new slide using a vulnerable shortcode.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when an admin approves a slide containing the malicious shortcode.
- Multiple shortcodes within the plugin are vulnerable to the same issue.
