## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Swift Framework < 2024.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.

### Proof of Concept

1. As a contributor, go to "Swift Slider > Add New Slide"
2. In the "Content > Caption Text" add the POC: `[spb\_boxed\_content element\_name="red" title=""test" box\_link="red"" box\_link\_target="self" el\_class='red" onmouseover="alert(/XSScontrib5/)"' width='1/1' el\_position="first last"]test content[/spb\_boxed\_content]`
3. When an admin approves the slide, the XSS will be seen.
Note: Other shortcodes throughout the plugin are vulnerable to the same issue.
