"text": "A vulnerability in the local malware analysis process of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling in the local malware analysis process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted file through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the local malware analysis process to crash, which could result in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nManual intervention may be required to recover from this situation.\r\nMalware cloud lookup and dynamic analysis will not be impacted.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the April 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: April 2022 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://tvce.cisco.com/security/aims/PublicationPreview.aspx?ID=74836&Version=1&Revision=26\"]."

"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FTD Software and had a Malware and File policy with Local Malware Analysis enabled.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n Determine the Software Configuration\r\nThe Local Malware Analysis feature is enabled through Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software and cannot be enabled in the Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) UI. This feature requires a Malware license.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the Local Malware Analysis feature is enabled, navigate to the Cisco FMC Software UI and select Policies > File Policy > Rules. If any of the rules have Local Malware Analysis displayed in the Action column, the feature is enabled. For more information, see the FMC Configuration Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/file\_policies\_and\_advanced\_malware\_protection.html\"]."
