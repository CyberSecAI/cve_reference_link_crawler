GHSA-22c6-wcjm-qfjg
Mar 9, 2022

## Package

google / data-transfer-project
(None)

## Affected versions

< 0.3.57

## Patched versions

0.3.57

## Description

### Impact

Information downloaded with the `google/data-transfer-project` may expose downloaded information to other local users.

### Prerequisites

This vulnerability impacts Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.

### Patches

Updates to version 0.3.57 or higher.

### Additional Information

* [dtinit/data-transfer-project#968](https://github.com/dtinit/data-transfer-project/issues/968)

### Workarounds

Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability for all operating systems.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
