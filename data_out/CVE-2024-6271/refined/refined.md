- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Community Events" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting events.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352). The plugin does not validate the origin of requests deleting events, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary events without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers the event deletion action. The vulnerable URL pattern is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=community-events-events&deleteevent=<<EVENT_ID>>`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious link/page. No specific network position is required.
