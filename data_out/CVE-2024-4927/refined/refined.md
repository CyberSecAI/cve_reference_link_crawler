Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of file type restrictions within the `save_product` function in `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/ajax.php`. This allows attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including executable files like PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the absence of any checks or restrictions on the file types that can be uploaded.
*   **Arbitrary File Extension:** The system does not validate the file extension before saving the file, allowing any type of file to be uploaded.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate the file content, opening the possibility of uploading malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Server Compromise:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By executing malicious code, the attacker can gain server privileges, potentially leading to full control of the server.
*   **Data Breach:** With server access, attackers can steal sensitive data, modify website content, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/ajax.php?action=save_product`.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is uploaded using the `multipart/form-data` content type.
*   **Filename Manipulation:** The attacker crafts the file name to have a malicious extension (e.g., `1.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/ajax.php?action=save_product`
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send an HTTP POST request with the appropriate parameters, including the malicious file.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability. It involves sending a `multipart/form-data` request to the vulnerable endpoint. This request contains several parameters, including the `img` parameter, which is the file being uploaded. Crucially, the filename in the POC is set to `1.php`, which contains PHP code: `<?php eval($_POST[1]);?>`. This allows arbitrary PHP code execution once the file is uploaded and accessed. The file gets uploaded to `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/assets/uploads/`.

The code analysis section confirms that the `save_product()` function called when `action=save_product` lacks any restriction on uploaded files, leading to the vulnerability.

The provided information is more descriptive than a typical CVE description and includes proof of concept code, code analysis details and screenshots of the exploitation process.
