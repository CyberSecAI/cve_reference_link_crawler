# Eclipse GlassFish Downloads

## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing Jakarta EE. This release is corresponding with the Jakarta EE 10 specification, which is a major new feature release. Jakarta EE 10 requires JDK 11 as a minimum, but also works on JDK 17 and JDK 21.

GlassFish 7.0.21 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 23. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release was all about hunting down a few nasty bugs reported by GlassFish users: restart hanging on fast machines (including ephemeral ports appearing when stopping GlassFish), random 403 responses for authenticated sessions and Faces that was failing to initialize on GlassFish embedded. We’re proud to announce that after a lot of research and a lot of work, we were able to squash them all. A special thanks to our users for reporting these and helping us to narrow them down!

| Looks good. But will give us absolute-path reference same redirect URI as protocol relative uri?  The point here is to not allow an attacker to post data which contain a redirect URL with protocol relative URL, which opens a vulnerability [CVE-2023-41080](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41080), which is fixed in the recent Tomcat in the same way: <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-11.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_11.0.0-M11> |
