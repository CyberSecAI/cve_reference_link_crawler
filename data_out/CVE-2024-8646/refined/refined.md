Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of vulnerable Apache Tomcat code within Eclipse Glassfish. Specifically, the issue arises from the handling of protocol-relative URLs in redirects.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability is a URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect'), categorized as CWE-601. The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize redirect URLs, allowing an attacker to inject a protocol-relative URL (e.g., `//evil.com`) which will redirect to attacker-controlled domains

**Impact:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can redirect users to malicious websites. This can be leveraged for various malicious purposes, such as:
   - Phishing attacks: Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
   - Malware distribution: Redirecting users to sites hosting malware.
   - Data exfiltration: Redirecting users to sites that attempt to steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - An attacker can inject a crafted URL containing a protocol-relative redirect into the application (the exact method is not described in the document).
   - The application, upon processing this URL, performs a redirect using the provided URL string without sanitization.
   - An unsuspecting user clicks the link and is redirected to the attacker's chosen destination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can perform the attack remotely (AV:N).
   - The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), such as clicking on a malicious link.
   - The attacker needs to inject a malicious redirect URL, likely through a deployed application's forms or query parameters.

**Additional Details:**
   - The vulnerability only affects applications deployed to the root context ('/').
   - The fix involves avoiding protocol-relative redirects by ensuring that redirect URLs are absolute (e.g., `https://example.com` rather than `//example.com`).
   - The fix was included in Glassfish version 7.0.10.
   - The issue is related to CVE-2023-41080 in Apache Tomcat.
   - The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS score of 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
