- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Remote command execution vulnerability due to improper input validation in the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the *root* user.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
