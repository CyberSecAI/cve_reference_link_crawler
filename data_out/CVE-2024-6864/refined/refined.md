{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'template' attribute of the 'lmt-post-modified-info' shortcode before outputting it in the web page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper output escaping",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the 'template' attribute of the 'lmt-post-modified-info' shortcode, which is then stored in the database and rendered on the website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can exploit this vulnerability. This means the attacker needs an account on the WordPress site with sufficient permissions to add shortcodes to the content."
