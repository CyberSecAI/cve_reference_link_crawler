## Description

### WP Last Modified Info: the Ultimate Last Modified plugin

Most WordPress themes usually show the date when a post was last published. This is fine for most blogs and static websites. However, WordPress is also used by websites where old articles are regularly updated. This last updated date and time is important information for those publications. The most common example is news websites. They often update old stories to show new developments, add corrections, or media files. If they only added the published date, then their users would miss those updates.

Many popular blogs and websites don’t show any date on their articles. This is a bad practice and you should never remove dates from your blog posts.

So now it is possible to add last modified/updated info on your WordPress posts and pages. Just install and activate this and configuration is very easy.

    }
?>

```

### Published date is equal to the modified date. What is the solution?

Sometimes you may want to show last modified date only. For that reason, post published date and modified date would be the same and the last modified date will still appear on post/pages even if it’s the same as the published date. In that case, you can set a time difference(ex. 1 day i.e. 24 hours) between post published date and modified date via plugin settings gap option.

Post detailed information about the issue in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-last-modified-info) and I will work to fix it.

I’ve been using WP Last Modified Info for a while now, and it’s been exactly what I needed to manage how and where the “last modified” date appears on my website.
What I really appreciate about this plugin is the control it gives me—I can selectively display the last modified date only on posts where it’s relevant. For example, some of my content doesn’t change often, and having the option to exclude those posts keeps things clean and professional. On the flip side, for posts I update regularly, it’s a simple way to let my readers know they’re getting the most up-to-date information.
The interface is intuitive, and setting it up was a breeze. I didn’t have to dig through endless settings to figure out how to get it working—it just works! Plus, the flexibility to customize the placement and appearance of the date makes it a great fit no matter how your site is designed.
If you’re looking for a lightweight, reliable solution for managing “last modified” dates on your WordPress site, this plugin is a fantastic choice. It’s helped me stay transparent with my audience without adding unnecessary clutter to my content. Highly recommend it!
