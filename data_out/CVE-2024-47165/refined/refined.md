- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `localhost_aliases` variable in Gradio server deployments includes "null" as a valid origin for CORS validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper CORS origin validation, specifically accepting the null origin.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft, such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files, especially when basic authentication is used.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through sending unauthorized requests from sources with a null origin like sandboxed iframes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Gradio server from a sandboxed iframe or other source that has a null origin. The Gradio server must be running locally.
