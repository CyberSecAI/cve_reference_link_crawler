- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Z Y N I T H WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts are executed when a user visits the site. The impact of this can vary greatly depending on the injected script but could include redirecting users to malicious sites, displaying unwanted advertisements, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
