# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in moment

High

[ichernev](/ichernev)
published
GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g
Jul 6, 2022

## Package

nuget

Moment.js
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

>= 2.18.0, < 2.29.4

## Patched versions

2.29.4

npm

moment
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

>= 2.18.0, < 2.29.4

2.29.4

## Description

### Impact

* using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs
* noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters
* users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks

### Patches

The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking.

### Workarounds

In general, given the proliferation of ReDoS attacks, it makes sense to limit the length of the user input to something sane, like 200 characters or less. I haven't seen legitimate cases of date-time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user-originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.

### References

There is an excellent writeup of the issue here: [#6015 (comment)](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973)

### Details

The issue is rooted in the code that removes legacy comments (stuff inside parenthesis) from strings during rfc2822 parsing. `moment("(".repeat(500000))` will take a few minutes to process, which is unacceptable.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31129

### Weaknesses

[CWE-1333](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1333)
