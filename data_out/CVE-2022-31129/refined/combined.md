| [@vovikhangcdv](https://github.com/vovikhangcdv) can you explain a bit how this is being fixed?  From the linked issue it looks like any open-close relationship that we have to track (not sure if there are more), has the same issue. Also is this compatible all the way back to Roman Empire JavaScript? |

### **[vovikhangcdv](/vovikhangcdv)** commented [Jun 11, 2022](#issuecomment-1152961973)

| Hi [@ichernev](https://github.com/ichernev), Great to see your response. There are some things we need to clarify.   ---   1. How this is being fixed?  **Firstly, look back to the original regex: `/\([^)]*\)|[\n\t]/g`.** The hotspot is `\([^)]*\)`. The process would be, sequentially:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45411113/173192511-2fc4d17b-db0f-4302-8fc3-3f8861adff6f.png)   1. Try to match the `(` character. 2. Try to match all those characters that are not `)`, ***as many times as possible (greedy)***. 3. Try to match the `)` character.   This process will be executed for the full input string and repeated with substring (remove the start character) until *match all the three steps* **or** *all characters are checked*.  Consider the evil payload format: `"(".repeat(X)` (the worst-case). This payload will exploit the greedy mechanism of step 2 and the backtracking mechanism of the failure matching process. For each `(`, step 2 will check all the rest of the substring characters (it costs `X - num_of_checked_substring` substeps) which certainly fails and the process has to backtrack and repeat for total X substrings. **This is a polynomial complexity problem.**  **Now, look to the suggested fix: `/\((?:(?!\().)*\)|[\n\t]/gs`.** The hotspot (after remove a non-capture group `(?:)`) is:`\(((?!\().)*\)`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45411113/173192836-766784c4-be8b-4d2d-8b4b-e587855fbb56.png)  The matching process would be similar to the old regex, except that step 2 uses non-greedy searching but a "look-ahead" mechanism. It will immediately fail when it matches the second `(` characters (cost one step instead of `X - num_of_checked_substring` substeps like the above example). **It means the matching process only costs linear steps based on the length of the input string.**   ---   2. There are a lot of regular expressions used in this project. Are there any similar issues in this project? How we can find and fix it?  The mission of `moment` is a third-party package that helps other projects and applications achieve their goals. I believe that eliminating all possible security vulnerabilities is crucial work for the community. Give a huge thank you and all the awesome contributors of this project. I see a lot of effort to reduce the risk of ReDos attack vector in the past ([#2936](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/2936), [#4163](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4163), and other relative commits). After carefully looking at the codebase, this is the only ReDoS vulnerability left I could find. To prevent this kind of vulnerability in the future, we just need to carefully use efficient regexes. The [recheck](https://devina.io/redos-checker) (see [the online version](https://devina.io/redos-checker)) is a useful tool to check the complexity of regex, just make sure that only the safe or linear regexes should be used.   ---   3. Is this compatible all the way back to Roman Empire JavaScript?  I am not sure what you asking about. But if you are concerned about the compatibility of the fix, I have tested the fix and confirm that it passed *160,555* test cases of unit tests. Or if I missing something, please let me know, and we will figure it out together.   ---   References:   * [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) * [Protect Against Regex Denial Of Service - ReDoS](https://blog.logrocket.com/protect-against-regex-denial-of-service-redos-attacks/) * [Staicu, Cristian-Alexandru, and Michael Pradel.

| Reading through the specification of the date format, it looks like formally a comment (stuff in brackets) can have a nested comment inside:  ``` FWS             =       ([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) /   ; Folding white space                         obs-FWS  ctext           =       NO-WS-CTL /     ; Non white space controls                          %d33-39 /       ; The rest of the US-ASCII                         %d42-91 /       ;  characters not including "(",                         %d93-126        ;  ")", or "\"  ccontent        =       ctext / quoted-pair / comment  comment         =       "(" *([FWS] ccontent) [FWS] ")"  CFWS            =       *([FWS] comment) (([FWS] comment) / FWS)  ```  note how `comment` includes `ccontent` which might include `comment`. Also note that CFWS is part of the `obs-` tokens, short for *obsolete*, so if this was obsolete in 2001 it might be safe to move on :)  To be fair, the Ruby standard library fails to parse dates with comments, so I'm not 100% sure we should deal with this crap. But if we do, there should be code to track open/closed parenthesis, if there is anything unbalanced the parsing should fail (because there are no brackets allowed in the actual string). This code is linear, so won't introduce bottlenecks.  If we keep the current comment approach (disallow open and close paren inside comment), it will "capture" (and remove) only the inner most comment, and the parsing will fail if there are nested comments (which, given the legacy-ness of all of this might be fine :)). |

| Yeh, I had noticed about nested comment in RFC2822 when trying to fix the issue before and was quite struggling with it :)). But looking at the old version of what `moment` did, I thought that was intended ignoring and done the same way :). |

* fix ReDoS in preprocessRFC2822 regex

Fixes: [[#2936](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/2936)]([#6012](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/6012))

Disallow nested rfc2822 comments to prevent quadratic regex execution time (i.e each open bracket is considered at most twice).

# Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in moment

High

[ichernev](/ichernev)
published
GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g
Jul 6, 2022

## Package

nuget

Moment.js
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

>= 2.18.0, < 2.29.4

## Patched versions

2.29.4

npm

moment
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

>= 2.18.0, < 2.29.4

2.29.4

## Description

### Impact

* using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs
* noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters
* users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks

### Patches

The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking.

### Workarounds

In general, given the proliferation of ReDoS attacks, it makes sense to limit the length of the user input to something sane, like 200 characters or less. I haven't seen legitimate cases of date-time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user-originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.

### References

There is an excellent writeup of the issue here: [#6015 (comment)](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973)

### Details

The issue is rooted in the code that removes legacy comments (stuff inside parenthesis) from strings during rfc2822 parsing. `moment("(".repeat(500000))` will take a few minutes to process, which is unacceptable.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31129

### Weaknesses

[CWE-1333](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1333)

Package        : node-moment
Version        : 2.24.0+ds-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24785 CVE-2022-31129
Debian Bug     : 1009327 1014845

Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating,
manipulating, and formatting dates. A couple of vulnerabilities
were reported as follows:

CVE-2022-24785

    A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of
    Moment.js, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly
    used to switch moment locale.

CVE-2022-31129

    Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient
    parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in
    moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by
    default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users
    may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k
    characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity
    length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS
    attacks.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.24.0+ds-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-moment packages.
