Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `wc_sf_url_check` function of the SuperFaktura WooCommerce plugin. This function was making use of `curl_init` and `curl_exec` to fetch the content from user-supplied URLs without proper authorization or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows authenticated users to make arbitrary HTTP requests to URLs they specify. The plugin was fetching URLs using curl functions which are prone to SSRF attacks.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The vulnerable function initially did not verify user permissions, allowing even subscriber-level users to trigger the SSRF.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin directly used the user-supplied URL without validating or sanitizing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially use this vulnerability to query internal services, accessing sensitive information that may not be publicly available.
*   **Internal Service Modification:**  Attackers might be able to modify data in internal services if those services don't require authentication, depending on the target service's implementation.
*   **Blind SSRF:** As described in the Wordfence article, the vulnerability is a "Blind SSRF". This means the attacker may not receive the full response body but can still influence the targeted server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can inject arbitrary URLs via POST request to the `wc_sf_url_check` function to trigger server-side requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
* The fix implemented in version 1.40.4 includes:
    *   **Nonce Verification:** Adds a nonce check (`check_ajax_referer`) to verify the request's origin and ensure it's coming from a legitimate admin session.
    *   **User Permission Check:** Implements a check (`current_user_can('edit_shop_orders')`) to ensure the user has sufficient privileges to perform the action.
    *   **Use of `wp_safe_remote_get`:** Replaces the use of `curl` functions with `wp_safe_remote_get`, a WordPress function specifically designed to prevent SSRF.
