Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-21809:

**Root Cause:** Improper conditions check in Intel® Quartus® Prime Lite Edition Design software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper conditions check. This suggests a flaw in how the software validates or handles certain conditions during its operation. This could involve missing checks, incorrect logical conditions, or inadequate validation of input or state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system where the software is running, potentially leading to unauthorized access, control, or data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected system, which implies physical access or access through a remote connection within the local network or the system itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be a legitimate user of the system, meaning they need to have valid credentials to log in. This could involve either legitimate user accounts on the target system or compromised ones.
- Local access: The attacker needs to be on the same system as the vulnerable software or have access to it remotely through the local network.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel® Quartus® Prime Lite Edition Design software before version 23.1.

**Mitigation:**
- Intel recommends updating Intel® Quartus® Prime Lite Edition Design software to version 23.1 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score is 6.7 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This further confirms that the vulnerability requires local access, has high complexity, requires a low privileged user and user interaction and results in a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
