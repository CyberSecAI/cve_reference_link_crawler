Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `grade` parameter within the `/view/show_student1.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The provided payload demonstrates the ability to inject SQL code via the `grade` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Exploitation can lead to the leakage of sensitive user data and system information.
*   **Compromised System Security:**  The vulnerability can compromise the overall security of the system, potentially leading to further attacks, such as data manipulation or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `grade` parameter in an HTTP request to `/view/show_student1.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, being able to send HTTP requests to the target URL and control the `grade` parameter value.
*  **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge about SQL to craft malicious queries to extract or manipulate the database.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** `/view/show_student1.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `grade`
*   **Payload Example:** The provided payload `grade='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(10)))v)%2B'` can be used to test and confirm the vulnerability, where it uses a time-based attack.
*   **Affected version:** The vulnerability affects version 1.0 and possibly earlier versions of the Complete Web-Based School Management System.
