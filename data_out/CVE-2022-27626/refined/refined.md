- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using shared resources with improper synchronization, specifically a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition in the session processing functionality of Out-of-Band (OOB) Management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Unspecified vectors via the OOB management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable service.
