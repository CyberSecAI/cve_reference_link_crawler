- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow in the `frmL7ProtForm` function due to unbounded `sprintf` usage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow. The `sprintf` function copies user-controlled `page` parameter from a POST request into a fixed-size buffer `v15` without any bounds checking, leading to the overflow if the input is larger than expected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/goform/L7Prot` with a large value for the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to the vulnerable device. The provided POC code shows how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request.
