Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input verification for the `cpass` parameter in the `change-password.php` file of the "Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code" project.
- The application directly uses the `cpass` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application does not sanitize user-provided data before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or filter user inputs, particularly the `cpass` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers might be able to gain comprehensive system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Exploitation could lead to service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `change-password.php` file.
- **`cpass` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `cpass` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Technical Details**
- **Vulnerable File:** `change-password.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `cpass`
- **Vulnerability Type:** Time-based blind SQL Injection
- **Example Payload (Time-based blind):**
  ```
  cpass=123' AND (SELECT 4875 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))QyJU) AND 'YCeg'='YCeg
  ```
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap` to automate the process.

**Suggested Remediation:**
1.  **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** Implement prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input to conform to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize Database User Permissions:** Ensure that database user accounts have the least necessary privileges.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities promptly.
