- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing release of resource after its effective lifetime. Specifically, this occurs in the Controller 7000 when handling communications with HBUS connected T-Series readers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime). The vulnerability lies in the software not properly releasing resources after they are no longer needed when under attack over the RS-485 interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A persistent denial-of-service (DoS). The affected T-Series readers connected via HBUS fail to automatically recover after an attack over the RS-485 interface, leading to a loss of functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the RS-485 interface, by targeting HBUS connected T-Series readers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the HBUS cabling to send the malicious traffic via RS-485.

The information provided includes the affected components (Controller 7000), affected versions of Command Centre, the vulnerability type (CWE-772), the impact (DoS), and the attack vector (RS-485 interface). It also specifies that the exploitation is not known to be active.
