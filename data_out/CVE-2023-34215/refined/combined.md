###### SUMMARY

### TN-5900 and TN-4900 Series Web Server Multiple Vulnerabilities

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-230402
* Version: V1.2
* Release Date: Oct 20, 2023
* Reference:
  + [CVE-2023-33237 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-33237)
  + [CVE-2023-33238 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-33238)
  + [CVE-2023-33239 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-33239)
  + [CVE-2023-34213 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-34213)
  + [CVE-2023-34214 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-34214)
  + [CVE-2023-34215 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-34215)
  + [CVE-2023-34216 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-34216)
  + [CVE-2023-34217 (cve.org)](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-34217)

TN-5900 Series prior to version 3.3 and the TN-4900 Series prior to version 1.2.4 are affected by multiple web server vulnerabilities. Insufficient input validation causes these vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending crafted input to the web service. If exploited successfully, these vulnerabilities could lead to Denial-of-Service, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

The identified vulnerability types and potential impacts are shown below:

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Improper Authentication (CWE-287)  CVE-2023-33237 | An attacker can use brute force to break the authentication parameters. |
| 2 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-77)  CVE-2023-33238, CVE-2023-33239, CVE-2023-34213, CVE-2023-34214, CVE-2023-34215 | An attacker located remotely can execute arbitrary commands on the device via a web interface. |
| 3 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)  CVE-2023-34216, CVE-2023-34217 | An attacker may be able to create or overwrite critical files that are used to execute code, such as programs or libraries. |

## Mitigation:

* Minimize network exposure to ensure the device is not accessible from the Internet.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

* The starting point of all the above vulnerabilities is from the web service, so it is suggested to disable the web service temporarily if you completed configuration to prevent further damages from these vulnerabilities until you have installed the patch or updated the firmware.

## Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable:

Only products listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

## Acknowledgment:

We would like to express our appreciation to Simon Janz of CODE WHITE GmbH for reporting the vulnerability, working with us to help enhance the security of our products, and helping us provide a better service to our customers.
