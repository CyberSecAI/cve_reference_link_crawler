- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application through user-provided input, which are then stored and executed when a victim views the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious code (UI:R).
