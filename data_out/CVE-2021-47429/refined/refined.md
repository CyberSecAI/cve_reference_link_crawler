The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel on PowerPC 64s architecture, specifically addressing how machine check exceptions (MCEs) are handled, and is relevant to CVE-2021-47429

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The machine check handler was incorrectly called as an async handler from NMI context in the case of an unrecoverable MCE. The early handler, which is the true NMI handler, would directly call the `machine_check_exception` handler when it couldn't recover. This was problematic because the `machine_check_exception` handler was designed to be an async handler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Calling an async handler from NMI context can lead to corruption of the irq state and other kernel data.
- This could trigger a BUG in `arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h` related to interrupt disabling checks.
- Improper handling of NMI context for machine check exceptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Corruption of kernel state.
- Kernel crash or panic, due to the BUG triggered in the interrupt handling logic or other issues from state corruption.
- System instability and unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an unrecoverable machine check exception. This would require a hardware error or some very specific conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger a hardware fault that results in an unrecoverable MCE. It is not a typical software based vulnerability
- No specific access is mentioned, but this would be a system level issue, not user space.
