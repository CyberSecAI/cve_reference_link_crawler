Based on the provided content, the identified vulnerabilities relate to user management authority within the "14Finger" project. The specific vulnerabilities are:

*   **User Sensitive Information Leakage:** This implies that sensitive user data is being exposed.
*   **User Privilege Escalation:**  Users are able to gain higher levels of access or permissions than intended.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** Unauthorized users can delete other user accounts.
*   **Arbitrary User Password Reset:** Unauthorized users can reset passwords of other user accounts.

**Root Cause:** The core issue is the lack of strict verification of user identity and permissions. The system does not properly enforce access controls, allowing users to perform actions outside their authorized scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  The primary weakness is inadequate access control mechanisms, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Lack of Authentication and Authorization:** The system does not effectively verify user identities and enforce the principle of least privilege, allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive user information can be exposed via information leakage.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** Arbitrary user deletion can cause data loss, and arbitrary password resets can lock users out of their accounts.
*   **Privilege Abuse:** Attackers can gain higher level access or privileges.
*   **Account Takeover:** Arbitrary password reset could lead to account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the application's user management functionality. By exploiting weaknesses in the authentication and authorization process, an attacker can manipulate these functionalities to cause the described impacts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have some level of access to the application to exploit these vulnerabilities. This could be as a regular user, if the access control is not properly implemented.
