Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `{$param.input}` variable is not filtered within the `parent-onselectresult` front-end function in several files of Maccms v10 v2024.1000.3000. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code. While the developers attempted to mitigate previous XSS issues (CVE-2022-26573) by using `htmlspecialchars` and `mac_filter_xss`, the filtering was not implemented in this specific part of the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflective XSS. The injected script is reflected back to the user in the response.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses the `{$param.input}` variable without proper sanitization or encoding in the `parent-onselectresult` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal administrator cookies.
- **Account Takeover:** By stealing cookies, an attacker can potentially impersonate an administrator, leading to further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vectors are HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints (`/sadmin.php/admin/art/data.html`, `/sadmin.php/admin/vod/data.html`, and `/sadmin.php/admin/website/data.html`).
- **`input` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `input` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** Although the attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoints (`/sadmin.php`), the XSS itself could be exploited even if the attacker does not have admin privileges if the vulnerable endpoints are accessed by an admin user while the attacker is able to influence the content of the page.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `parent-onselectresult` function.
- The vulnerable parameter is `{$param.input}`.
- Example exploit payloads include: `input=1"><ScRiPt%20>alert(1)</ScRiPt>`.
- Vulnerable endpoints:
  - `/sadmin.php/admin/art/data.html`
  - `/sadmin.php/admin/vod/data.html`
  - `/sadmin.php/admin/website/data.html`
