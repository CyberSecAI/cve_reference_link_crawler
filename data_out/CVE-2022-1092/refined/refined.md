- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The myCred plugin's `mycred-tools-import-export` AJAX action lacks authorization and CSRF checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing authorization: Any authenticated user (including subscribers) can access the AJAX action, bypassing intended access controls.
    - Missing CSRF protection: No checks are in place to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve a list of email addresses from the WordPress blog. This information disclosure could potentially lead to privacy violations and further attacks (e.g., spam campaigns, phishing attempts).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessed through an AJAX call (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site (at least a subscriber role).
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, which can be achieved through a browser or a custom script.
