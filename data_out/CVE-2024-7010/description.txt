mudler/localai version 2.17.1 is vulnerable to a Timing Attack. This type of side-channel attack allows an attacker to compromise the cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Specifically, in the context of password handling, an attacker can determine valid login credentials based on the server's response time, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
