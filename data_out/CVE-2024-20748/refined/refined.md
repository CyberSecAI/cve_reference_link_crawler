Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the `avar` table processing of OpenType fonts embedded in PDF files. Specifically, the `tableLength` of the `avar` table is not validated against the actual data read, leading to reads beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The core issue is that the code reads data past the end of the `avar` table buffer due to insufficient size validation during parsing.
- The code does not properly validate that the size of the `avar` table is large enough to accommodate the number of axes and their corresponding `SegmentMaps`, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory regions within the process's memory space which could lead to disclosure of sensitive information. This could be exploited to bypass exploit mitigations.
- Although the vendor classifies this as memory leak, the Talos report mentions potential disclosure of arbitrary memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** A specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious OpenType font with a truncated `avar` table is used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a PDF document, embedding a malicious font file.
- The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted PDF to a target user.
- The attacker requires no special access to the target system besides the user's ability to open the pdf file.

**Technical Details:**
- The `avar` table contains a header, followed by `SegmentMaps` records. The header contains `majorVersion`, `minorVersion`, a `Reserved` field and `axisCount`.
- `SegmentMaps` contain `positionMapCount` and `axisValueMaps`.
- The vulnerability arises when `tableLength` of `avar` is less than `(0x08 + ( 0x02 * axisCount ) + ( positionMapCount_1 * 4 + positionMapCount_2 * 4 + ... + positionMapCount_n * 4))`. Where n is `axisCount`.
- The `positionMapCount` is read from the malformed font file, and then used to calculate a buffer size. However, there is no validation that enough bytes remain in the buffer before accessing them, causing an out of bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the CoolType library which is used by Adobe Acrobat Reader.
- Talos used a debugger to demonstrate the out-of-bounds read.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 23.008.20533 of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
- The advisory includes other vulnerabilities that were patched in the same update.
