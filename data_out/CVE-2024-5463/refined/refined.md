- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A classic buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the login component due to a buffer copy operation without proper size validation of the input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic Buffer Overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can conduct denial-of-service attacks. The login service will restart automatically. The impact also includes the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the login component through unspecified vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device. No authentication is required.
