Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input when generating HTTP responses using the `cgi` gem in Ruby. Specifically, the `cgi` gem prior to versions 0.1.0.2, 0.2.2, and 0.3.5 did not properly sanitize user-provided data used in HTTP responses. Additionally, the `CGI::Cookie` object did not validate input properly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core vulnerability is an HTTP response splitting issue. By injecting specially crafted input, an attacker can insert malicious headers and/or bodies into the HTTP response. This is possible due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data.
*   **Cookie Injection:** The `CGI::Cookie` object also had a vulnerability where untrusted user input could lead to the injection of invalid attributes into the `Set-Cookie` header. Although considered less likely to be exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially use the vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification:** Successful exploitation could allow for the addition or modification of data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **HTTP Response Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, which could lead to various attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected content is then processed by a client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through user-provided input that is used to generate HTTP responses. This could be through URL parameters, form submissions, or any other method where user input is incorporated into the HTTP response generation using the vulnerable `cgi` gem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by an application which generates HTTP responses using the vulnerable versions of the `cgi` gem.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory indicates that no NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability because they don't use the vulnerable gem in a way that exposes them to the described issues.
*   The vulnerability is in the Ruby `cgi` gem, not the core Ruby language.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the user input in the cgi gem.
*   The provided information also shows that various Linux distributions, including Fedora and Debian, released updates for Ruby to address the vulnerability, which includes updating the vulnerable cgi gem.

In summary, CVE-2021-33621 describes an HTTP response splitting vulnerability within the Ruby `cgi` gem that arises from improper input sanitization, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate HTTP responses for information disclosure, data modification, DoS, or other attacks.
