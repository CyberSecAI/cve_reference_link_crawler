The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10296.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `card-bwdates-reports-details.php` file of the PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System V1.0. Specifically, the `fromdate` and `todate` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'fromdate' and 'todate' parameters in the `card-bwdates-reports-details.php` endpoint.
- Blind SQL Injection: Boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection is possible in both the 'fromdate' and 'todate' parameters
- Stacked Queries: Stacked SQL queries are possible in the 'todate' parameter.
- UNION query: Generic UNION queries are possible in the 'todate' parameter

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `/mcgs/admin/card-bwdates-reports-details.php` endpoint.
- Parameter manipulation: The attacker manipulates the `fromdate` and `todate` POST parameters with malicious SQL payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker needs access to the application's admin interface, as the vulnerable page is located in the `/admin` directory
