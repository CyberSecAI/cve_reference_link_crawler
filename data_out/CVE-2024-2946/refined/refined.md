### Root cause of vulnerability
The ShopLentor plugin for WordPress fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes when generating a QR code via the plugin's QR Code Widget.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

### Impact of exploitation
- Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, which will execute when a user accesses an injected page.
- Successful exploitation can lead to malicious actions such as cookie stealing, session hijacking, and defacement.

### Attack vectors
- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts via the plugin's QR Code Widget.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- Authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher.
- Ability to utilize the QR code widget.
