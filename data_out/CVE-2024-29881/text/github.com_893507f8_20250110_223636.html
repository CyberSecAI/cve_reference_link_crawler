# TinyMCE Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in handling external SVG files through Object or Embed elements

## Description

### Impact

A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.

### Fix

TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new `convert_unsafe_embeds` option to automatically convert `object` and `embed` elements respective of their `type` attribute. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards, the `convert_unsafe_embeds` option is enabled by default.

### Workarounds

If you are using TinyMCE 6.8.1 or higher, set `convert_unsafe_embeds` to true. For any earlier versions, a custom NodeFilter is recommended to remove or modify any `object` or `embed` elements. This can be added using the `editor.parser.addNodeFilter` and `editor.serializer.addNodeFilter` APIs.

### Acknowledgements

Tiny Technologies would like to thank Toni Huttunen of [Fraktal Oy](https://www.fraktal.fi/) for discovering this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
