Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-29881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability stemming from how TinyMCE handles external SVG files loaded through `<object>` or `<embed>` elements. These elements could potentially load SVG images containing malicious XSS payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or handling of SVG content within `<object>` and `<embed>` elements, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.
- **Unsafe Embeds:** The use of `<object>` and `<embed>` elements without adequate security measures creates a pathway for injecting malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the user's browser when rendering the TinyMCE editor content.
- **Data Theft:** The injected scripts could be used to steal sensitive data, such as session cookies, user credentials, or other private information.
- **Malicious Actions:** The injected scripts could perform unauthorized actions, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, modifying web page content, or performing other harmful activities.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** If an attacker can get malicious SVG content into the editor, and subsequently another user views that content in a browser, the user's account on the application may be at risk

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Content Insertion:** Attackers can inject malicious SVG files by using the editorâ€™s features to insert external content through the use of `<object>` or `<embed>` elements.
- **Pasting:** Attackers could paste HTML containing these elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to TinyMCE Editor:** Attackers need to have the ability to insert or manipulate content within a TinyMCE editor instance. This may require access to an account with appropriate permissions.
- **Malicious SVG Content:** Attackers must create an SVG file with a malicious script.
- **User Interaction:** The malicious SVG would have to be loaded in a user's browser through an editor, making the user an unwilling participant in the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- **Mitigation:** TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced the `convert_unsafe_embeds` option to address this vulnerability by automatically converting `<object>` and `<embed>` elements to safer alternatives. This option is enabled by default from TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards.
- **Workarounds:** For versions prior to 6.8.1 a custom NodeFilter can be used to remove or modify the `object` and `embed` elements.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Toni Huttunen of Fraktal Oy.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-29881.

**Summary of changes in TinyMCE to mitigate CVE-2024-29881:**
* The `convert_unsafe_embeds` option was introduced, which when set to `true`, will automatically convert `<object>` and `<embed>` elements to the correct element depending on the MIME type.
* The default value of this option is `true` from TinyMCE version 7.0 onwards.
