# TinyMCE 6.8.1

|  | These are the Tiny Cloud and TinyMCE Enterprise release notes. For information on the latest community version of TinyMCE, see the [TinyMCE Changelog](../changelog/). |
| --- | --- |

## Overview

TinyMCE 6.8.1 was released for TinyMCE Enterprise and Tiny Cloud on Wednesday, December 06 th, 2023. These release notes provide an overview of the changes for TinyMCE 6.8.1, including:

* [Accompanying Premium plugin changes](#accompanying-premium-plugin-changes)
* [Accompanying Premium Skins and Icon Packs changes](#accompanying-premium-skins-and-icon-packs-changes)
* [Improvements](#improvements)
* [Additions](#additions)
* [Bug fixes](#bug-fixes)

## Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside TinyMCE 6.8.1.

### Advanced Templates 1.4.0

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Templates** premium plugin.

**Advanced Templates** 1.4.0 includes the following improvement and fix.

#### New `{{mce-clipboard}}` marker as a placeholder within template content, indicating the location where clipboard content will be inserted

**Advanced Template** 1.4.0 introduces a new feature that allows templates to now include special markers, denoted as `{{mce-clipboard}}`. These markers serve as placeholders that indicate where clipboard content should be inserted once the template is added to the editor’s content.

The string to add is as follows: `{{mce-clipboard}}`.

Example
```
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
  plugins: [ "code", "advtemplate", "undo", "redo", "mergetags", ],
  toolbar: "inserttemplate | undo redo | mergetags",
  advtemplate_templates: [
    {
      title: 'mce-clipboard template',
      items: [
        {
          id: '1',
	  title: 'clipboard',
          content: '{{mce-clipboard}}'
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

As a result, when a user inserts a template containing the `{{mce-clipboard}}` marker, the editor will replace these markers with the actual content from the clipboard. This dynamic replacement ensures that users can effortlessly integrate clipboard content into their templates without the need for additional copy-pasting steps.

|  | when the host browser is **FireFox**, the user will be prompted with a notification error, as it currently does not support clipboard reading. |
| --- | --- |

#### The functionality of the `{{mce-cursor}}` marker feature was broken after the upgrade to TinyMCE 6.7.3

Security patch for TinyMCE 6.7.3, made changes to **ZWNBSP** characters so they are now removed from any content passed via the `insertContent` API. **ZWNBSP** characters were used to add padding to the marker to avoid it cleaning out the empty content.

As a consequence, the `{{mce-cursor}}` marker functionality for the Advanced Templates plugin stopped working.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, by replacing the **ZWNBSP** character with a `data-mce-bookmark` attribute to the marker, thus preserving them in the inserted template content.

As a result, the `{{mce-cursor}}` marker functionality is now working as expected.

For information on the **Advanced Templates** plugin, see: [Advanced Templates](../advanced-templates/).

### AI Assistant 1.2.0

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **AI Assistant** premium plugin.

**AI Assistant** 1.2.0 includes the following improvement:

#### Add selection-based option to ai shortcuts to restrict shortcut misuse

In **AI Assistant 1.2.0**, the new selection property is available for shortcuts with prompts in the [`ai_shortcuts` option](../ai/#ai_shortcuts). This `boolean` property controls when that shortcut is enabled based on the current selection within the editor.

For a shortcut with a prompt, when the property is:

* `true`: this shortcut will *only* be enabled when user *has* made a selection in the editor;
* `false`: this shortcut will *only* be enabled when the user *has not* made a selection in the editor;
* `undefined`: or *not set*, this shortcut will *always* be enabled.

This property allows the definition of shortcuts which should only operate when the user has selected content, requiring the selection as context to the AI when the property is `true`. Additionally, shortcuts that are intended to generate specific content will not be enabled with any selection when the property if `false`.

As part of this update, all of the default shortcuts available in **AI Assistant 1.2.0** now have the property `selection: false`, as they are all shortcuts that require a selection context to generate content correctly.

For information on the **AI Assistant** plugin, see: [AI Assistant](../ai/).

### Comments 3.3.4

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **Comments** premium plugin.

**Comments** 3.3.4 includes the following fix:

### Switching from an empty paragraph to a section with a comment didn’t enable `Add comment…​` textarea

In previous versions of TinyMCE, occasionally the sidebar would unexpectedly be set as readonly due to an invalid selection state.

As a consequence, when the user moved the cursor from an empty element to a commented text selection, the sidebar and comments section would change to be readonly.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, when the editor verifies that the sidebar state should set as readonly `false`, it also update invalid selection to `false`, so both states do not affect the sidebar state.

For information on the **Comments** plugin, see: [Comments plugin](../introduction-to-tiny-comments/).

### PowerPaste 6.2.3

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** 6.2.3 includes the following fixes:

### Safari - Improve pasting content with sidebar comments from the Word document

Previously, when copying content, including comments, and subsequently pasting it into a TinyMCE document, the comments were also unintentionally included in the pasted data.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, when a user copies and pastes content from Word with the inclusion of comments, the **Powerpaste** plugin now excludes these comments from the pasted content.

### Pasting underlined content from MS Word with PowerPaste results in empty rows being underlined

Previously, when a user pasted content from Word, the pasted content would be converted to:

```
<p><s>Sold out on tickets.</s></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>Sorry!</p>
```

As a consequence, two distinct behaviors were apparent.

1. Firstly, the content displayed in Word did **not** render an underline for the second line, but only as an empty line.
2. In TinyMCE the same content renders an underline in the second line.

To fix this, when a paragraph contains no content except for a `&nbsp;`, then PowerPaste would unwrap that specific paragraph so that it becomes:

```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
```

Instead of:

```
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
```

**Powerpaste 6.4.2** addresses this issue, now, when a paragraph contains a `&nbsp;` within the copied text content, the inner `s` tags, `u` tags and `spans` are removed on paste.

### Powerpaste pasting causes window to be scrolled when editor isn’t fully visible

Previously, when the `setProgressState(true)` API was invoked while the editor is **not** completely visible, it would trigger the editor to `focus`.

As a consequence, the page automatically scrolls until the editor is fully visible.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the editor retains the focus functionality whilst eliminating the need for the automatic scrolling behavior.

As a result, the editor will still receive `focus` as intended, but the page will no longer scroll unnecessarily when pasted content is inserted.

### Reset table border width when the paste source is Excel from .5pt to 1px

Previously, when pasting a table from a Microsoft Excel document that had a solid thin border of (.5pt) such as `border: 0.5px solid #000;` into the editor when powerpaste was enabled would result in the table rendering as a `dashed` border instead of the solid border.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this by updating the default table border width for tables within TinyMCE from `.5pt` to `1px`.

As a result, pasting tables now retains its original solid border on paste.

### Spell Checker Pro 3.3.1

The TinyMCE 6.7.0 release includes an accompanying release of the **Spell Checker Pro** premium plugin.

**Spell Checker Pro** 3.3.1 includes the following fixes:

### Spellchecker does not trigger on shift+enter

Previously, while pressing **Enter**, **Spacebar** or changing context within the editor after an incorrectly spelled word would trigger the **Spell Checker Pro** plugin. Although it was discovered that after pressing **Shift+Enter**, the plugin failed to trigger, as the initial implementation did not consider this keypress as a space, or as a change to the context.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the **Spell Checker Pro** mechanism is triggered by either **Space**, **Enter** or **Shift+Enter**.

### As-you-type spellechecking would sometimes interrupt composing in certain languages

Spell Checker Pro would in some situations be interrupted while composing when the user selects a suggestion with a `space`.

As a consequence, issues such as duplication or other unintended outcomes would occur.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, by introducing a new check that prevents **as-you-type** checks from being performed if composing is already in progress.

As a result, composing can now be done safely.

For information on the **Spell Checker Pro** plugin, see: [Spell Checker Pro plugin](../introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/)

### Advanced Typography 1.1.3

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Typography** premium plugin.

**Advanced Typography** 1.1.3 includes one fix:

#### If tinymcespellchecker and typography are both loaded, tinymcespellchecker prevents typography from transforming the string, (tm) into the character âÃÂ¢

Previously when the TinyMCE **Spell Checker Pro** plugin and the **Advanced Typography** plugin were both loaded, the **Spell Checker Pro** plugin would prevent the **Advanced Typography** plugin from transforming the string, `(tm)` into the character `â¢`.

The **Spell Checker Pro** originally would wrap elements with a fake element to underline misspelled words, and as the **Advanced Typography** plugin is designed to detect wrapped elements from the spellchecker, this resulted in it parsing 'tm' instead of `(tm)`.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the **Advanced Typography** parser utilizes functionality provided by internal library, which enables it to identify both the prefix and suffix of an element.

As a result when the **Advanced Typography** plugin encounters a string 'tm' the system also checks for the presence of parentheses before and after, to ensure it correctly transform’s any instance of `(tm)` to `â¢`.

For information on the **Advanced Typography** plugin, see: [Advanced Typography](../advanced-typography/).

## Accompanying Premium Skins and Icon Packs changes

The TinyMCE 6.8.1 release includes an accompanying release of the **Premium Skins and Icon Packs**.

### Premium Skins and Icon Packs

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** release includes the following updates:

The **Premium Skins and Icon Packs** were rebuilt to pull in the changes also incorporated into the default TinyMCE 6.8.1 skin, Oxide.

For information on using premium skins and icon packs, see: [Premium Skins and Icon Packs](../enhanced-skins-and-icon-packs/).

## Improvements

TinyMCE 6.8.1 also includes the following improvements:

### Colorpicker now includes the Brightness/Saturation selector and hue slider in the keyboard navigable items

As a result of an accessibility report for TinyMCE, it was discovered that the color picker dialog scored lower than expected, specifically when the user attempted to interact with the brightness/saturation selector and the hue slider when selecting a foreground or background color.

As a consequence, it was noted that the color picker was not fully accessible via keyboard.

TinyMCE 6.8.1.1 addresses this issue, now, when navigating through the dialog using the keyboard, the focus will be on the brightness/saturation pane, this allows the user to use the arrow keys to navigate in all four directions when selection a color. In addition when holding the "shift" key down, the navigation speed will be increased. This functionality has also been applied to the hue slider for added benefit for accessibility.

### Improved the tooltips of picker buttons for the urlinput components in the "Insert/Edit Image" and "Insert/Edit Link" dialogs

In previous versions of TinyMCE, the tooltips of file picker buttons of `urlinput` dialog components assumed the label of the component.

Consequently, the tooltip does not always clearly indicate the functionality of the file picker button. This affected the `urlinput` dialog components in the **Insert/Edit Link**, **Insert/Edit Image**, and **Insert/Edit Media** dialogs.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, the tooltips of `urlinput` file picker buttons on affected dialogs have been improved as follows:

|  | Insert/Edit Link | Insert/Edit Image | Insert/Edit Media |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Old | "URL" | "Source" | "Source" |
| New | "Browse links" | "Browse files" | "Browse files" |

### Inline dialog will now respect size: 'large' argument in the dialog spec

In previous versions of TinyMCE, when a dialog was redialed with a new `size` value, that value would have no effect on the size of the dialog.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, now, the size of the dialog is updated when the dialog is redialed with a spec containing a new `size` that is different from the current size.

### Bespoke dropdown toolbar buttons including align, fontfamily, fontsize, blocks, and styles did not include their visible text labels in their accessible names

Prior to TinyMCE 6.8.1, accessibility labels of bespoke dropdown buttons only announced the name of the button, and not the visible text label of the selected option.

For example, when the `fontfamily` dropdown button selection was set to âVerdanaâ, the accessibility name was set as âFontsâ. However, it should have been set as âFonts Verdanaâ as the selected option is also visible on the button.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, the visible text label *(or icon name where icons are present instead)* of selected options of bespoke dropdown buttons are appended to the accessible name. This ensures that the accessible name of the above scenario is announced as âFonts Verdanaâ, improving accessibility.

## Additions

TinyMCE 6.8.1 also includes the following additions:

### Added `default_font_stack` editor option that makes it possible to define what is considered a system font stack.

|  | This feature is only available for TinyMCE 6.8 and later. |
| --- | --- |

TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduces a new option `default_font_stack`, that allows integrators to define the default font stack for the "System Font" stack in the fontfamily toolbar and menu items.

The array should contain a font family name that matches the default fonts configured in the `content_css` CSS file.

Example
```
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  toolbar: 'fontsize',
  default_font_stack: [ '-apple-system', 'Arial' ]
});
```

### Added `force_hex_color` editor option. Option `'always'` converts all RGB & RGBA colours to hex, `'rgb_only'` will only convert RGB and **not** RGBA colours to hex, `'off'` won’t convert any colours to hex

Previously, when applying colors to content within the editor via the `forecolor` and `backcolor`, HEX colors were always converted to RGB.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, by adding the new editor option `force_hex_color: 'off'` which is set as **default**, can now be added to the TinyMCE config by;

* **force\_hex\_color: 'always'**: all colors are converted and applied as HEX format.
* **force\_hex\_color: 'rgb\_only'**: only RGB and not RGBA colors are converted and applied as HEX.
* **force\_hex\_color: 'off'**: (default option) no conversion to hex is applied, and they are left as their input format.

### New `sandbox_iframes` option that controls whether iframe elements will be added a `sandbox=""` attribute to mitigate malicious intent

Recently it was discovered that iframes could embed resources that can cause nefarious effects when inserted into the editor via scripting and other mechanisms. This was especially problematic if the iframe had scripts that triggered automatic downloads of malicious files, or if the iframe resource is hosted on the same origin as the editor, which could lead to highly impactful scripting in the same context. In addition, since iframes can be modified to have very small, near-invisible dimensions, they could be unintentionally copied and pasted by users into the editor.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this, by introducing a new `sandbox_iframes` boolean option. When set to `true`, it will add a `sandbox=""` attribute to all iframes inserted into the editor. According to [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox), this will restrict the iframe’s embedded resource from performing potentially malicious actions including scripting, file downloads, browser popups, passing the same-origin policy, among others.

|  | `sandbox_iframes`: is set to `false` by default, which is the existing behavior. This is because enabling `sandbox_iframes` may break **existing media embeds** such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Codepen, as actions such as scripting and same-origin access are prevented. |
| --- | --- |

### New `convert_unsafe_embeds` option that controls whether `<object>` and `<embed>` elements will be converted to more restrictive alternatives, namely `<img>` for image MIME types, `<video>` for video MIME types, `<audio>` audio MIME types, or `<iframe>` for other or unspecified MIME types

Previously the `<object>` and `<embed>` elements, similar to `<iframe>` elements, could embed external resources. However, unlike `<iframe>`, `<object>` and `<embed>` elements did not have a sandboxing mechanism to neutralize resources which have potentially nefarious effects such as malicious scripting, automatic downloads of dangerous files, among others.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this by introducing a new `convert_unsafe_embeds` boolean option. When set to `true`, `<object>` and `<embed>` elements will be converted to different safer alternatives based on their embedded content’s MIME type, set via the `type` attribute:

* an image MIME type (starts with `image/`) will be converted to the `<img>` element;
* a video MIME type (starts with `video/`) will be converted to the `<video>` element;
* an audio MIME type (starts with `audio/`) will be converted to the `<audio>` element; and
* any other MIME type or if it is unspecified will be converted to the `<iframe>` element.

The first three types of conversions will prevent scripting and other potentially malicious actions by the embedded resource.

To ensure any embeds converted to `<iframe>` elements are also neutralized, it is recommended to enable the new `sandbox_iframes` option. This will add a `sandbox=""` attribute to the converted iframe and prevent the embedded resource from performing potentially malicious actions such as executing scripts, triggering downloads, passing the same-origin policy, etc.

|  | `convert_unsafe_embeds`: is set to `false` by default to prevent breaking changes to content output. |

## Bug fixes

TinyMCE 6.8.1 also includes the following bug fixes:

### Pressing Enter when focusing on the `details` component for an Accordion deletes its structure

Previously, clicking on the expand arrow of a `details` element would result in the editor selection to be external of the `summary` element when the host browser was Safari.

As a consequence, the plugin failed to detect if the selection was at the beginning of the `details` element, which resulted in a unsuccessful attempt to toggle the Accordion component when the **Enter** key is pressed

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the predicate considers that the selection can be right before the `summary` element, so the Accordion toggling can work as expected on Safari.

### Directionality would not be consistently applied to the entire accordion block

Previously, when applying directionality to the accordion, the `dir` attribute was modified in both the `summary` and auxiliary accordion body `div` element. However, the auxiliary accordion body `div` element disappeared during the editor serialization process, resulting in the loss of the applied `dir` value for the accordion content.

As a consequence, when selecting the accordion block and applying **RTL** directionality, the alignment was only applied to the `summary`, not the entire accordion.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue.

As a result, when selecting an accordion component, the selection now encompasses the entire details element. This ensures that alignment is applied to the entire accordion block when applying directionality, such as **RTL**, to the component.

### A closing notification brings focus to the editor even when focus is outside of the editor

Previously TinyMCE’s notification system would bring the focus to the editors content after the user;

* inserted new content by typing;
* was then displayed a notification;
* closed it; then
* immediately resumed typing without having to click again

As a consequence, the `focus` would consistently shift back to the editor, irrespective of its current location when the notification closed.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the focus is only retained within the editor if the notification closure was initiated by user interaction.

### Selecting a cell with only `&nbsp;` in a table inside a `td` and then press `backspace` the entire table is deleted

Previously, the editor checked the number of tables included in a selection by identifying the closest parent to the selected elements within the table. However, when selecting part of a nested table along with some other element, two different tables were detected: the nested one and the one containing both the nested table and the additional element.

The consequence of this issue was that deleting the selection emptied the main table containing the additional element because it was the last part of the selection, and the selection also included another table (the nested one). Since the entire nested table was contained in the main table, it was completely deleted as well.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now the editor recognizes this scenario and manages it as if the additional element was not contained in any table. As a result, the deletion now behaves as if it were outside a table, and it functions as expected.

### All applied inline formats are lost when format is removed

Previously, a formatted caret was mistakenly perceived as an empty element, which resulted in,

* a unintended consequence which forced the editor to clear the entire editor DOM when toggling the formatted node, and;
* the de-formatting logic which iterates from the **innermost** to the **outermost** formatted node until a match is found, **failed** to execute the expected behavior as it did not account for parent formatted nodes.

However, with the recent fix in TinyMCE 6.8.1, the caret is now disregarded when clearing the editor, and before removing the caret format, the system now checks if the matching format node is **non-nullable** and retrieves the parent nodes when necessary.

As a result, formatting can now be correctly removed in both empty and non-empty editors.

### Editor would convert urls that are not http/s or relative resulting in broken links

In previous versions of TinyMCE, when using the **Link Plugin**, and inserting a link that is not http/s or relative (such as onenote link), the editor would modify/update the link by adding a new hostname to the url.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the editor no longer changes links that are not http/s or relative.

### Applying heading formatting to the content of the summary element extended its application to the content of the parent details element

Previously, editor schema heading elements were **invalid** children of a `<summary>` node within the Accordion component.

As a consequence of this, any attempt to apply a heading format to the `<summary>` content within the Accordion component was unsuccessful.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, updates have been applied to the editor schema for heading elements, so they can now be converted as **valid** children of the `<summary>` element.

|  | To remove the heading format applied to a <summary> element, click on the same applied heading format in the dropdown to "unset" the format. |
| --- | --- |

### Resize handles would not appear on editable images in a non-editable context

In previous versions of TinyMCE, a regression was identified that affected images nested within a `NonEditable` section.

As a consequence, the editor would only check the parent element within a nested editable section, which neglected to inspect the image itself and treated the image as a readonly element, rendering it uneditable.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the editor checks the **"readonly"** attribute on images, rather than just the parent element.

### Setting the content with an attribute that contains a self-closing HTML tag did not preserve the tag

In previous versions of **DOMPurify**, a critical issue was identified where attributes containing the self-closing `/>` tags were erroneously removed during the sanitization process.

This issue stemmed from a older version of DOMPurify was inadvertently truncating attributes associated with self-closing tags.

Truncated attributes
```
<div>Attribute with empty element (&lt;br/&gt;)</div>
```

Expected attributes
```
<div data-macro-parameters="title=<br/>">Attribute with empty element (&lt;br/&gt;)</div>
```

As a consequence, the removal of these attributes by **DOMPurify** would cause significant problems in the users web applications.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue by updating **DOMPurify** to the latest version. By doing so, these attributes are no longer removed, which preserves the integrity of their content.

### Screen readers now announce the selected color of forecolor and backcolor buttons

Previously, when changing the color for either `forecolor` and `backcolor`, screen readers didn’t announce the last selected color for that button.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the last selected color for Text/Background color are read aloud by the screen reader as expected.

### Custom block element’s where not considered block elements in some cases

Before, if a user copied and pasted a block element that was inside a custom element like the example config below, the editor would make an duplicate copy of the outer wrapper for the custom block element when pasting the content back. This happened because the function didn’t check if the element is a wrapper element.

```
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  extended_valid_elements: 'mycustomblock[id],mycustominline',
  custom_elements: 'mycustomblock,~mycustominline' // Notice the ~ prefix to force a span element for the element
});
```

TinyMCE 6.8.1, now also considers **custom elements** as part of its process when checking if the element is a wrapper element.

### Creating a new li via enter inside a nested list would not inherit styles from the source li

Previously, when the user created a new `li` from a nested list within its parent by keypress **Enter** the editor would ignore the styles applied to the nested list.

As a consequence, the new `li` did not **inherit** the nested list styles.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, when the user creates a new `li` item within a nested list, the styles are copied over from the âsourceâ to the newly created `li` as expected.

### Removing an LI element containing a details element would incorrectly merge its content

Previously, when a caret was positioned at the start of a list item containing only one block element, pressing the Backspace key caused the block content to unwrap.

This had the unintended consequence of detaching the child `details` element content and appending it to the content of the preceding list item. Unfortunately, this action left the `summary` element devoid of its requisite parent `details` element, rendering it structurally invalid.
TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue. now, the details content is no longer unwrapped and moved to the upper list item, which preserves the component’s expected structure.

### Merging an external p inside a list via delete or backspace would incorrectly try to move a parent element inside a child element

Previously, when the caret was positioned at either the,

1. **beginning** of the `<p>` and the `backspace` key is pressed; or
2. **end** of the `<li>` with **id child** and the `delete` key is pressed.

the `<p>` tag element would be moved inside the child element, rather than the context being merged with the `<li>` child element context.

Example
```
<ol>
  <li>List 1</li>
  <li id="parent">
    <p>p1</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="child">List 1-1 </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Place cursor at the start of this line and hit backspace.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
```

As a consequence, a console error `"Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': The new child element contains the parent"`, would be displayed in the developer console.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, after pressing the backspace or delete key, the parent element no longer attempts to merge into the child element, but rather unwraps the parent element and merges the context into the child element, resulting in:

Example (result)
```
<ol>
  <li>List 1</li>
  <li id="parent">
    <p>p1</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="child">List 1-1 Place cursor at the start of this line and hit backspace.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
```

As a result, the developer console, no longer displays the console error and the merge between the two elements behaves as expected.

### The `fontsizeinput` toolbar item was causing console warnings when toolbar items were clicked

The console error warning "The component must be in a context to execute: triggerEvent" stemmed from two distinct causes.

1. Firstly, the toolbar was unintentionally initialized twice during the rendering process.
2. Secondly, the 'fontsizeinput' exhibited a flaw in its 'destroy' action, as it was applied only to one of its three components (namely, the `+` button, input, and `-` button).

As a consequence, these issues manifested between the first and second initialization of the toolbar resulting in the input of the first 'fontsizeinput' not been entirely unmounted, leading to attempts to update a **non-existent** input.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now the editor removes the redundant second initialization of the toolbar, and fix the 'fontsizeinput' 'destroy' action, so all its components are now properly unmounted. This fix ensures that updates are only applied to components that genuinely exist.

### Menubar buttons with more than one word would sometimes wrap into two lines

Previously when rendering the menubar in sync with the fetch of the styles, it was possible in some situations that the styles would render after the menubar.

As a consequence, the menubar would not correctly render such as the `width` of a button, as a result the button width would force the button to wrap vertically rather then display the button content as intended.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this issue, now, the rendering for the toolbar is done after the styles have been fetched.

As a result, the `width` of the buttons now display correctly.

### Dialog collection items would not display any icons chosen from icon pack

In earlier versions of TinyMCE, collection items set in a [collection dialog component](../dialog-components/#collection) would not display any icon as set in the `icon` property, instead only displaying the `string` itself.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, dialog collection items will now use any specified `icon` from the [icon pack](../editor-icons/#icons), with the `string` itself used in the case where no such icon exists. This is the current behaviour, as in most uses of dialog collections in TinyMCE, the `icon` property is set as an individual character, such as in the [Emoticons](../emoticons/) and [Charmap](../charmap/) plugins.

For information on the **Dialog layout components for collections** plugin see [dialog components](../dialog-components/#collection).

### Screen readers now announce the active autocompleter item

As focus is required to be in the editor when interacting with the autocompleter or mentions plugins, a issue was identified when the user would navigate through the autocompleter menu.

As a consequence, this may have cause difficulty navigating through the autocompleter menu for users relying on screen readers.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this, now, by adding `aria-owns` and `aria-activedescendant` attributes into the editor body. This will now ensure that the screen reader can announce the current active autocomplete item when the user navigates through the menu.

|  | Closing the autocompleter will remove the attributes. |
| --- | --- |

As a result, these modifications significantly enhance the accessibility of autocompleter and mentions plugins for users relying on screen readers.

### Translation syntax for announcement text in the table grid was incorrectly formatted

In TinyMCE 6.7.0, each cell in the table grid menu item was updated so that it would announce the number of columns and rows currently selected.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1 translations were added for this text, though this announcement was still only available in English as the syntax used for the table grid announcement text in detecting strings which are to be translated was invalid.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 addresses this, now, the syntax has been corrected and each cell in the table grid announces the current selected columns and rows in the correct language, *not only* in English.

### The functions schema.isWrapper and schema.isInline didn’t exclude element names that started with # those should not be considered elements.

Previously the `isInline` and `isWrapper` functions in the Schema module would incorrectly output `true` for elements nodes when their name begins with `#` such as `#text` and `#comment`.

As a consequence, in certain cases the editor would attempt to append a child node inside such a element node, which is forbidden and resulted in an error being thrown.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, `Schema.isInline` and `Schema.isWrapper` now, excludes element nodes for those which names starts with `#`, such as `#text` and `#comment`.

As a result, these elements are no longer considered as valid inline or wrapper elements, preventing errors caused by element methods being called on specific element nodes like these.

For information on the **Markdown** plugin, see [Markdown](../markdown/).

## Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside TinyMCE 7.0.

### TinyMCE 7.0 plugin naming unification

With the release of TinyMCE 7.0, the below plugins are adopting the following name changes.

| Old Name | New Name |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced Code Editor | Enhanced Code Editor |
| Advanced Lists | List Styles |
| Advanced Tables | Enhanced Tables |
| Advanced Templates | Templates |
| Enhanced Image Editing | Image Editing |
| Skins & Icons Packs | Enhanced Skins & Icons Packs |
| Spell Checker Pro | Spell Checker |

|  | That while these changes are to update the plugin names used in documentation and communication materials, this does not alter the plugin identifiers themselves at this time. This means that existing integrations and configurations will remain unaffected by this change. |
| --- | --- |

### Templates

The TinyMCE 7.0 release includes an accompanying release of the **Templates** premium plugin.

**Templates** includes the following improvement.

#### Missing tooltip for category and template three dots menu button in the **Templates** dialog.

Previously, the three dots menu button for category and template in the **Templates** dialog were missing a tooltip, making them inaccessible.

In TinyMCE 7.0, the three dot menu buttons for categories and templates in the Templates dialog now have informative tooltips. This clarifies their purpose for all users, enhancing discoverability and improving the overall experience, especially for those relying on assistive technologies.

|  | The **Templates** plugin mentioned here refers to the premium plugin that has been renamed, not the open-source plugin. See [TinyMCE 7.0 plugin naming unification](#tinymce-7-0-plugin-naming-unification) for more information. |
| --- | --- |

### Enhanced Code Editor

The TinyMCE 7.0 release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Code Editor** premium plugin.

**Enhanced Code Editor** includes the following fixes, additions, and improvements.

#### Updated CodeMirror to version 6.

TinyMCE 7.0 introduces CodeMirror 6.

With this update, users have gained access to improved features "to be expanded on in future releases" and a more responsive editing experience.

During the integration process, TinyMCE made necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility between TinyMCE 7.0 and CodeMirror 6. Specifically, our CSS reset rules were refined to accommodate the dynamically generated styles of CodeMirror 6 and as a result the `codemirror.css` file was removed from the plugin deployment.

This update from CodeMirror 5 to 6 should have no impact on customers utilizing the Enhanced Code Editor feature. More information about CodeMirror 6 will be included in future patch releases.

#### Updated keyboard shortcuts for Enhanced Code Editor.

With the update to CodeMirror 6 with TinyMCE 7.0, brings the below updated keyboard shortcuts for Enhanced Code Editor.

### Enhanced Code Editor search and replace keyboard shortcuts

Enhanced Code Editor provides the following shortcuts within the code dialog.

| Action | Windows Shortcut | macOS Shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find | Ctrl+F | Command+F |
| Find Next | F3 | F3 |
| Find Previous | Shift+F3 | Shift+F3 |
| Go to Line | Ctrl+G | Command+G |
| Close Search Panel | Esc | Esc |
| Indent Code | Ctrl+] | Command+] |
| Outdent Code | Ctrl+[ | Command+[ |
| Fold Code | Ctrl-Shift-[ | Command-Option-[ |
| Unfold Code | Ctrl-Shift-] | Command-Option-] |
| Fold All | Ctrl-Alt-[ | Ctrl-Option-[ |
| Unfold All | Ctrl-Alt-] | Ctrl-Option-] |
| Accept Completion | Enter | Enter |

For information on the Enhanced Code Editor plugin, see: [Enhanced Code Editor](../advcode/).

#### Tab and shift + tab didn’t not navigate to the next tab stop inside the code dialog.

Previous versions of the Enhanced Code Editor (formally known as Advanced Code Editor), in the code dialog, the `tab` and `shift + tab` functionalities failed to navigate to the next tab stop.

As the Enhanced Code Editor serves as the container for `Codemirror`, this absence resulted in ineffective tab navigation.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, by implementing the new tab behavior for the Enhanced Code Editor, thereby resolving the problem.

As a result, both the Enhanced Code Editor and `Codemirror` now exhibit managed tabbing behavior’s, ensuring smoother navigation within the code dialog.

#### Add `Cmd+g`/`Ctrl+g` shortcut for `gotoLine` command.

Enhanced Code Editor introduces a new shortcut: `ctrl+g` for Linux and Windows, and `cmd+g` for Mac users with TinyMCE 7.0.

The shortcut allows the user to:

* quickly jump to any line in your code.
* specify line numbers
* use relative offsets like + or -
* document percentages with %, and;
* even add a column position with a colon and a number after the line.

Find more details in the documentation here: [gotoLine](https://codemirror.net/docs/ref/#search.gotoLine)

#### Add `aria-label` to Enhanced Code Editor.

During an internal audit, it was discoverd that the `<textarea>` element within the "Source Code" dialog, which allows users to input code, was missing an accessible name.

This meant that screen reader users could not read the proper information about the purpose of the input field when navigating it.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, by adding an `aria-label` attribute to the `<textarea>` element with the value "Source code".

As a result, screen readers now announce the input field as "Source code" when users navigate into it.

## Accompanying open source plugin end-of-life announcement

The following open source plugin has been announced as reaching its end-of-life:

### The open-source `template` plugin has been removed.

The open-source `template` plugin and associated config options have been removed in TinyMCE 7.0.

Customers using the `template`Â plugin will need to migrate to the premium ['advtemplate'](../advanced-templates/) plugin in TinyMCE 7.0, which contains all the functionality except some esoteric options.

For more information, see [Migrating from TinyMCE 6 to TinyMCE 7](../migration-from-6x/#removed-plugins-template-plugin).

## Accompanying Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs changes

The TinyMCE 7.0 release includes an accompanying release of the **Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs**.

### Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs

The **Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs** release includes the following updates:

The **Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs** were rebuilt to pull in the changes also incorporated into the default TinyMCE 7.0 skin, Oxide.

#### Fixed some focus issues related to TinyMCE 5 skin and Enhanced skins.

The current colors for various UI buttons didnât provide suitable contrast against the background/neighboring components.

As a consequence, users with accessibility requirements had difficulty determining the current `active/focused/hovered/enabled` component in the UI.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the colors for many of these UI components have been updated for each of these states.

As a result, these components now have appropriate levels of contrast for ease of use by users with accessibility requirements.

For information on using Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs, see: [Enhanced Skins & Icon Packs](../enhanced-skins-and-icon-packs/).

## Improvements

TinyMCE 7.0 also includes the following improvements:

### Shortcut included in tooltips for basic and toggle toolbar buttons.

Previously, basic and toggle toolbar buttons lacked keyboard shortcut information in the native browser tooltip. This could leave users unaware of available shortcuts and, therefore unable to use them.

To address this, TinyMCE 7.0, introduces custom tooltips for these buttons. These tooltips now clearly display the keyboard shortcut alongside the button’s description as follows:

* Default buttons: This includes commonly used functions like `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `selectall`, `redo`, `undo`, heading levels (`h1-h6`), `help`, `link`, `save`, `searchreplace`, and `fullscreen`.
* Custom buttons: Any custom toolbar button registered with a keyboard shortcut will also display the shortcut in its tooltip.

See the [Basic toolbar button](../custom-basic-toolbar-button/), [Toggle toolbar button](../custom-toggle-toolbar-button/) and [Keyboard Shortcuts](../shortcuts/) documentation for more information.

### Added custom tooltip for dialog collection items, now visible on both mouse hover and keyboard focus.

Previously, collection items set in a [collection dialog component](../dialog-components/#collection) would not display a tooltip on keyboard focus.

This means that keyboard-only users were not able to see the tooltip, as it was only shown on mouse hover.

In TinyMCE 7.0, dialog collection items with `data-mce-tooltip` attribute, such as those used in [Emoticons](../emoticons/) and [Charmap](../charmap/) plugins, now display relevant tooltips on both mouse hover and keyboard focus. This ensures all users, including those relying solely on keyboard navigation, can access helpful information about these items.

### Make table ghost element better reflect height changes when resizing.

Previously, the table ghost element did not accurately reflect changes in table height when resized using the corner resize handles.

In TinyMCE 7.0, this problem has been addressed.

As a result, the table ghost element now accurately mirrors adjustments in table height when resized using the corner resize handles.

### Autocompleter did not work when attempting to insert a `mention` or `emoji` when using an `IME`.

Previously when attempting to insert a **mention** or **emoji** using an `IME` on Android and using Korean, users encountered an obstacle where it wasn’t possible to complete the insertion.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, by rewriting the handler for `autocompleter`, ensuring that it no longer interferes with the DOM during composition with an IME.

As a result, users can now insert **mentions** and **emojis** using the `autocompleter`.

For information on the **Autocompleter** plugin, see: [Autocompleter](../autocompleter/).

### Improved accessibility for interactive elements with custom tooltips.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, buttons without visible labels displayed browser native tooltips which only shows on mouse hover, not keyboard focus. This meant keyboard-only users couldn’t access these tooltips, hindering their understanding of button functionality.

To address this, TinyMCE 7.0 introduces custom tooltips for various elements:

* Toolbar buttons
* Resize handle
* Buttons in a dialog
* Buttons in a view container

These custom tooltips appear on both mouse hover and keyboard focus, ensuring all users, including those relying solely on keyboard navigation, can access essential information about interactive elements.

|  | Interactive elements with visible labels do not display custom tooltips, and the browser native tooltips have been removed, as the visible label provides sufficient information. |
| --- | --- |

|  | The `max-width` of the tooltips is set to `15em`, to overwrite the default `max-width` of the tooltips, update the `@tooltip-max-width` variable in your custom skin. |
| --- | --- |

### Added tooltips to `Click for more info` button in the accessibility checker dialog.

The absence of a tooltip on the "Click for more info" button within the `accessibility` dialog rendered it inaccessible for keyboard-only users, affecting their ability to fully engage with the functionality.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, by adding the tooltip to the button, ensuring its visibility both on mouse hover and keyboard focus.

### Improved Custom Elements.

TinyMCE 7.0 introduces enhancements to the existing [custom\_elements](../content-filtering/#custom_elements) option and [addCustomElements](../apis/tinymce.html.schema/#addCustomElements) API. This update allows the structure of custom elements to be refined, offering users more flexibility and customization options.

Key Improvements:

* **New Custom Element Structure:** The custom\_elements option and `addCustomElements` API now support a more complex structure. Each element is defined by a key-value pair, allowing for detailed specifications.
* **Attributes and Inheritance:** Elements can inherit attributes and children from other specified elements using the extends property in the Custom Element Spec.
* **Attribute and Children Specifications:** The Custom Element Spec includes properties such as attributes and children, enabling precise customization of element behavior.

For more information and details for `addCustomElements` see [custom\_elements](../content-filtering/#custom_elements).

### Improved support of `data` elements.

Previously, when inserting a `data` element within the editor, the `data` element would be removed.

In TinyMCE 7.0, this problem has been addressed.

As a result, the `data` elements are recognized as valid elements within the editor, ensuring they are properly retained along with their value attributes.

## Additions

TinyMCE 7.0 also includes the following addition:

### A new `trigger` property for block text pattern configurations, allowing pattern activation with either Space or Enter keys.

This release introduces a new `trigger` property for block text pattern configurations, allowing pattern activation with either `Space` or `Enter` keys.

In TinyMCE 7.0 the default preconfigured text patterns **was changed from**:

Example preconfigured text\_patterns prior to TinyMCE 7.0
```
[
  { start: '*', end: '*', format: 'italic' },
  { start: '**', end: '**', format: 'bold' },
  { start: '#', format: 'h1' },
  { start: '##', format: 'h2' },
  { start: '###', format: 'h3' },
  { start: '####', format: 'h4' },
  { start: '#####', format: 'h5' },
  { start: '######', format: 'h6' },
  // The following text patterns require the `lists` plugin
  { start: '1. ', cmd: 'InsertOrderedList' },
  { start: '* ', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList' },
  { start: '- ', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList' }
]
```

to the following new preconfigured defaults:

Example preconfigured text\_patterns for TinyMCE 7.0+
```
[
  { start: '*', end: '*', format: 'italic' },
  { start: '**', end: '**', format: 'bold' },
  { start: '#', format: 'h1', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '##', format: 'h2', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '###', format: 'h3', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '####', format: 'h4', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '#####', format: 'h5', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '######', format: 'h6', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '1.', cmd: 'InsertOrderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '*', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '-', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '>', cmd: 'mceBlockQuote', trigger: 'space' },
  { start: '---', cmd: 'InsertHorizontalRule', trigger: 'space' },
]
```

|  | Customers that wish to revert back to the previous default block `text_patterns` execution on `Enter` key pressing will be required to replace the preconfigured `text_patterns` with following array: |
| --- | --- |

```
[
  { start: '*', end: '*', format: 'italic' },
  { start: '**', end: '**', format: 'bold' },
  { start: '#', format: 'h1', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '##', format: 'h2', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '###', format: 'h3', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '####', format: 'h4', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '#####', format: 'h5', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '######', format: 'h6', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '1. ', cmd: 'InsertOrderedList', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '* ', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'enter' },
  { start: '- ', cmd: 'InsertUnorderedList', trigger: 'enter' },
]
```

|  | The `trigger` property is exclusively applicable to the configuration of block text patterns. It is not recognized in the configurations for inline and replacement text patterns. |
| --- | --- |

For information on the **text\_patterns**, see [Text Patterns](../content-behavior-options/#text_patterns)

### Added custom tooltip for `autocompleter`, now visible on both mouse hover and keyboard focus, except single column cases.

Previously when using [Autocompleter](../autocompleter/), the native browser tooltip was only shown on mouse hover, but not on keyboard focus.

This means that keyboard-only users were not able to see the tooltip, as it was only shown on mouse hover.

To address this in TinyMCE 7.0, custom tooltips have been implemented for `autocompleter` items.

Now, tooltips are now shown on `autocompleter` items both on mouse over and keyboard focus, providing visual indication for keyboard-only users.

|  | The tooltip will only be displayed when the `autocompleter` columns are set to a value greater than `1`. This is because when there is a visible label, the tooltip functionality is not needed and therefore omitted. |
| --- | --- |

### Element preset support for the `valid_children` option and `Schema.addValidChildren` API.

TinyMCE 7.0 updates the [`valid_elements`](../content-filtering/#valid_elements) option and `schema.addValidChildren` function, which now support preset names such as `@blocks`, `@phrasing`, and `@flow`. These presets will be automatically expanded into corresponding lists of valid elements, simplifying the definition process.

For instance, specifying valid\_children: `'custom-elm[@flow]'` will configure the `custom-elm` element to accept any child element classified as a flow element. This streamlines the process of defining valid elements and eliminates the need to manually list all elements from the schema spec.

Example
```
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",
	custom_elements: 'block-container,phrasing-container,flow-container',
	valid_children: 'block-container[@blocks],phrasing-container[@phrasing],flow-container[@flow]'
});
```

For more information on content filtering for custom elements, see [custom\_elements](../content-filtering/#custom_elements.adoc).

## Changes

TinyMCE 7.0 also includes the following changes:

### `convert_unsafe_embeds` editor option is now defaulted to `true`.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, [convert\_unsafe\_embeds](../content-filtering/#convert-unsafe-embeds) editor option was introduced to allow `object` and `embed` elements to be converted by default to the correct element, respective of the MIME type, automatically when inserted into the editor.

In TinyMCE 7.0, the default value for `convert_unsafe_embeds` will change from `false` to `true`, meaning that all `object` and `embed` tags will automatically be converted to different elements when inserted to the editor. If this behaviour is undesirable, set `convert_unsafe_embeds` to `false` in your editor configuration.

For further details on the `convert_unsafe_embeds` option, see the [content filtering options](../content-filtering/#convert-unsafe-embeds), or refer to the [security guide](../security/#convert-unsafe-embeds), or the [TinyMCE 6.8.1 release notes](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-convert_unsafe_embeds-option-that-controls-whether-object-and-embed-elements-will-be-converted-to-more-restrictive-alternatives-namely-img-for-image-mime-types-video-for-video-mime-types-audio-audio-mime-types-or-iframe-for-other-or-unspecified-mime-types).

### `sandbox_iframes` editor option is now defaulted to `true`.

In TinyMCE 6.8.1, the [sandbox iframes](../content-filtering/#sandbox-iframes) editor option was introduced to allow iframes to be sandboxed by default when inserted into the editor.

In TinyMCE 7.0, the default for `sandbox_iframes` will change from `false` to `true`, meaning that all `iframe` elements inserted into the editor will be given the `sandbox=""` attribute by default, preventing most actions, including scripting and same-origin access, which may break existing editor content or produce undesirable effects.

To prevent any expected iframes from being sandboxed, we recommend adding the source domains of such iframes to the new [`sandbox_iframes_exclusions`](../content-filtering/#sandbox-iframes-exclusions) option list, and including the domains in the default list where necessary. To prevent all iframes from being sandboxed, set the option `sandbox_iframes` to `false` in your editor configuration.

For further details on the `sandbox_iframes` option, see the [the content filtering options](../content-filtering/#sandbox-iframes), or refer to the [security guide](../security/#sandbox-iframes), or the [TinyMCE 6.8.1 release notes](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-sandbox_iframes-option-that-controls-whether-iframe-elements-will-be-added-a-sandbox-attribute-to-mitigate-malicious-intent).

### The `DOMUtils.isEmpty` API function has been modified to consider nodes containing only comments as empty.

In previous versions of TinyMCE (prior to version 7.0), the function `DomUtils.isEmpty` behaved inconsistently, considering elements with only comment nodes as non-empty.

As a consequence, elements visually appearing empty due to containing only comment nodes could lead to inconsistent behavior in caret placement and selection handling.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, when using `DomUtils.isEmpty`, elements containing only comment nodes are correctly recognized as empty.

As a result, caret placement and selection handling within elements containing only comment nodes now behave consistently.

|  | Users who relied on `DOMUtils.isEmpty` returning `false` for elements with only comments should update their implementation. Elements with only comment nodes are now recognized as empty in TinyMCE 7.0. |
| --- | --- |

### The `highlight_on_focus` option now defaults to true, adding a focus outline to every editor.

In TinyMCE 6.4, the option `highlight_on_focus` was introduced, that provides a blue outline to an instantiated TinyMCE editor when the editor is in `focus`.

As of TinyMCE 7.0, the `default` value of this has now been set to `true`.

For more information about `highlight_on_focus` see the [highlight\_on\_focus](../accessibility/#highlight_on_focus) option.

|  | Any editors using this `highlight_on_focus: true` option, can remove this option from their TinyMCE init configuration when upgrading to TinyMCE 7.0. |
| --- | --- |

### Remove the height field from the `table` plugin cell dialog. The `table` plugin row dialog now controls the row height by setting the height on the `tr` element, not the `td` elements.

The height field within the table plugin cell dialog has been removed, thereby restricting the ability to adjust individual cell heights `td/th`.

However, this modification directs users to utilize the table plugin row dialog to alter the height of entire rows along with all enclosed cells.

|  | When adjusting row height through the row dialog, any height styles previously applied to `td/th` elements will be automatically removed. |
| --- | --- |

### Change table height resizing handling to remove heights from `td`/`th` elements and only apply to `tr` elements.

When resizing a table using either the row resize bars or corner resize handles, any existing `height` styles are removed from the `td`/`th` elements and only apply to `tr` elements and `table` element. Additionally, the heights calculated and applied for the `tr` elements and `table` element more accurately represent the actual visual height in the editor.

As part of the changes to table height resizing handling, resizing via the corner resize handles is more consistent. If the table **does not** have any height styles and the table is resized using one of the corner resize handles, each row has its height increased evenly. If the table **does have** existing height styles, corner resizes will only change the height of the first row (if using top corner handles) or last row (if using bottom corner handles) equivalent to `table_column_resizing: 'resizetable'` option for columns [Table options: table\_column\_resizing](../table-options/#table_column_resizing)

### Removed incorrect `aria-placeholder` attribute from editor body when `placeholder` option is set.

Previously, when the `placeholder` option was set, the editor would automatically append an `aria-placeholder` attribute to the editor body.

However, the `aria-placeholder` attribute is not a valid attribute for the body element according to accessibility guidelines. As a result, certain screen readers and assistive technologies encountered difficulties in correctly interpreting the content.

In TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this, by removing the `aria-placeholder` attribute from the editor body. This solution ensures that the editor is accessible to all users.

### Optional Tooltip for Dialog Footer Toggle Buttons.

Previously, the `DialogFooterToggleButton` component required a tooltip property. This meant including a tooltip for all toggle buttons displayed in dialog footers, even if the information wasn’t necessary.

As of TinyMCE 7.0, the tooltip property is now optional for `DialogFooterToggleButton`. This flexibility allows developers to omit the tooltip for buttons where it’s not required, providing a cleaner and more focused user experience.

### Changed the `media_url_resolver` option to use promises.

In TinyMCE 6, the `media_url_resolver` option used a callback rather than a promise, which lead to unforeseen consequences.

To rectify this, all instances of `media_url_resolver` were refactored to utilize promises.

As a result, this fix not only standardized the codebase but also significantly enhanced error handling.

For more information on using `media_url_resolver`, see [media\_url\_resolver](../media/#media_url_resolver)

### Accurate default options in the `styles` bespoke select toolbar button.

Previously, the bespoke `styles` select toolbar button in TinyMCE defaulted to "Paragraph" as the selected option even when there was no actual "Paragraph" style configured.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this, the fallback option for the bespoke `styles` toolbar button has been reverted to "Formats" in situations where the "Paragraph" style is not defined in the `style_formats` option. This ensures a more accurate reflection of available styles.

## Removed

TinyMCE 7.0 also includes the following removals:

### Removed `force_hex_color` option, with the default now being all colors are forced to HEX format and as lower case.

Previously in TinyMCE 6, all colors in the content HTML were set to use `rgb` values by default. As the common practice is using `hex` values, this change has been **reverted**.

As a result, in TinyMCE 7, only RGB values in absolute value like `rgb(255, 255, 255)` are converted to HEX values. Other RGB formats such as those with non-absolute values, and color options such as RGBA and HSL remain unchanged. The `forced_hex_color` option has been removed.

For more information, see [Migrating from TinyMCE 6 to TinyMCE 7](../migration-from-6x/#force-hex-color).

### Removed `InsertOrderedList` and `InsertUnorderedList` commands from core.

Previously, native list commands could be executed by various text patterns.

This resulted in undefined browser behavior due to the inherent list code within it.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this, by removing the core list commands, effectively eliminating the insertion of lists into the content.

As a result, users no longer experience unexpected list insertions.

### The autocompleter `ch` configuration property has been removed. Use the `trigger` property instead.

Previously, the `ch` configuration property was used to specify the character that would trigger the autocompleter.

This property was deprecated in [TinyMCE 6.2](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.2-release-notes/#deprecated) and has been removed in TinyMCE 7.0. Instead, use the `trigger` property to specify the `string` that will trigger the autocompleter.

If `editor.ui.registry.addAutocompleter(name, options)` was used in your configuration, updating your configuration from `ch: '<string>',` to `trigger: '<string>',` is required.

|  | The new `trigger` option can handle multiple character strings as the trigger. |
| --- | --- |

For more information, visit the updated [Autocompleter](../autocompleter/) documentation.

### Removed `closeButton` from `NotificationSpec`, close button in notification is now rendered by default.

To improve keyboard navigation and accessibility in TinyMCE 7.0, notifications have been standardized by removing the ability to customize the presence of a close button. This change ensures a consistent tabbing order across different notifications.

As a result, the close button is now a standard feature in all notifications. Any customizations or configurations related to the `closeButton` setting will no longer affect the functionality of notifications.

## Bug fixes

TinyMCE 7.0 also includes the following bug fixes:

### `mceTableDeleteRow` did not calculate the correct row index for colgroup tables.

Previously, when deleting a row or column in a table within TinyMCE, the caret or cursor position would relocate to the first cell of the table.

As a consequence, users expected it to be repositioned much closer, such as to an adjacent cell in the previous row or column.

In TinyMCE 7.0, this issue is addressed, now, when a user deletes a row or column in a table, the caret/cursor position is now relocated to the adjacent cell in the previous row or column.

### Heading formatting would be partially applied to the content within the `summary` element when the caret was positioned between words.

With the release of TinyMCE 6.8, applying heading formatting to the content within the `<summary>` element was introduced. However, an issue was identified: if the caret was positioned between words, the editor’s selection expand range functionality would not expand the selection to include the entire content within the `<summary>` element.

As a consequence, the heading formatting was partially applied to some of the content within the `<summary>` element.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, updates were made to the editor’s selection expand range functionality.

As a result, the heading format is applied to the entire content within the `<summary>` element, regardless of the carets location.

### Moving focus to the outside of the editor after having clicked a menu would not dispatch a `blur` event as expected.

In TinyMCE, an issue was identified where clicking outside the editor while a menu was in either the opened or closed state resulted in the blur event not being triggered as expected.

Consequently, the `blur` event was not dispatched when switching focus outside the editor, as the UI was still considered part of the editor.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this by now considering UI events as part of the normal editor events.

As a result, the `blur` event is now properly dispatched when switching focus outside the editor.

### Autocomplete would sometimes cause corrupt data when starting during text composition.

Previously in TinyMCE, the autocomplete feature did not properly interrupt or consider composing mode for keyboards when typing in `Korean`.

For example, when typing 'neko' with `Korean` keyboard the following states will be passed through:

* `ã`
* `ãã·`
* `ãë¤`
* `ãë¤ã`

As a consequence, the autocomplete feature triggers as the composition mode changes from `ã` to `ãã·`, with `ã·` being in composing mode. While it copies the text into a new element, it disrupts the composing mode. As a result, when typing `k`, nothing appeared to happen, although in the background, the composing mode actually changes to `ë¤`. Then, when `o` is pressed, the content of the composing mode is added, and the new character is put into composing mode instead, resulting in the text `ãã·ë¤ã`.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue by, now avoiding `DOM` mutation during IME composition, ensuring uninterrupted composition sessions without introducing new elements to the DOM.

### Inline mode with persisted toolbar would show regardless of the skin being loaded, causing css issues.

Previously when `toolbar_persist` and `inline` mode was set to `true`, the toolbar could be shown before the skin was loaded. Whereas now it will always wait for the skin to load first.

### Table classes couldn’t be removed via setting an empty value in `table_class_list`.

Previously, it was not possible to remove all classes on a table when setting an empty value in the `table_class_list` option and using the "Class" listbox field in the "Table Properties" dialog.

TinyMCE 7.0 introduces improvements for handling and removing classes on table, row and cell elements, including:

* An empty value in the `table_class_list` option, `table_row_class_list` option, and `table_cell_class_list` option will allow all classes to be removed on the selected table for the "Table Properties" dialog, selected rows for the "Row Properties" dialog, or selected cells for the "Cell Properties" dialog respectively.
* For a table with a class that does not match any of the values set in the `table_class_list` option, a "Select…​" item becomes the default choice in the "Class" listbox field in the "Table Properties" dialog. (This selection maintains the existing class upon saving). Conversely, if the table has a class that does match one of the values set in the `table_class_list` option, it is automatically selected.
* For selected rows with classes that do not match any of the values set in the `table_row_class_list`, a "Select…​" item becomes the default choice in the "Class" listbox field in the "Row Properties" dialog. (This selection maintains the existing classes upon saving). Conversely, if the selected row classes do match one of the values set in the `table_row_class_list`, it is automatically selected.
* For selected cells with classes that do not match any of the values set in the `table_cell_class_list`, a "Select…​" item becomes the default choice in the "Class" listbox field in the "Cell Properties" dialog. (This selection maintains the existing classes upon saving). Conversely, if the selected cell classes do match one of the values set in the `table_cell_class_list`, it is automatically selected.

### Directly right clicking on a `<ol>`/ `<li>` in FireFox didn’t enable the button `List Properties…​` in the context menu.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, two issues where identified that affected `list properties` for `<ol><li>` tags:

1. in old versions of Firefox (prior to version 121), the caret was not moved to the target position when using the right click, and;
2. as TinyMCE creates a bookmark when there is no selection for Firefox, when a user opened a context menu the editor would jump back to the newly created bookmark.

As a consequence, since the selection is still on the first element, the `List Properties…​` context menu item was `disabled`.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now when the user opens a context menu, TinyMCE creates a new bookmark to avoid the jump back.

As a result, the selection is in the correct place and the `List Properties…​` context menu item is `enabled`.

### The `link_default_target` option wasn’t considered when inserting a link via `quicklink` toolbar.

Previously when using `quicklink`, the `link_default_target` value was not being considered.

As a consequence, the `target` attribute would not be applied to links created using `quicklink`.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the `quicklink` has been enhanced to consider the `link_default_target` value.

As a result, if a `link_default_target` is specified, `quicklink` will appropriately incorporate it when creating a link.

### When inline editor toolbar wrapped to multiple lines the top wasn’t always calculated.

Previously when shrinking the inline editor, the top position of the toolbar was calculated before wrapping the toolbar into multiple rows.

As a consequence, the additional rows in the wrapped toolbar would cover the editor content.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the editor shrinking is applied before calculating the top position of the toolbar.

As a result, the truncated toolbar is correctly displayed above the editor content.

#### Removed manually dispatching `dragend` event on drop in Firefox.

Dragging and dropping an image between two cells in a table with the **PowerPaste** plugin enabled triggered the manual dispatching of the `dragend` event when the host browser was Firefox.

As a consequence, the image was duplicated into the new cell instead of being moved from the old cell to the new one.

In TinyMCE 7.0, this manual dispatching of the `dragend` event in Firefox has been removed.

As a result, when an image is `dragged` and `dropped` from one cell to another, it now correctly moves without duplicating itself.

### Pressing Backspace at the start of an empty `summary` element within a `details` element nested in a list item no longer removes the `summary` element.

Previously in TinyMCE, when a details element was placed inside a list item and contained an empty summary, pressing the Backspace key (with the cursor at the beginning of the summary) resulted in the summary being deleted.

This caused the unexpected behavior of replacing the summary contents with the default summary placeholder.

To address this, the summary element has been included in the list of non-empty elements within the editor’s schema.

With this adjustment, the summary element will no longer be deleted under the previously mentioned conditions.

### The toolbar width was miscalculated for the inline editor positioned inside a scrollable container.

Previously in TinyMCE, the inline editor’s toolbar width was calculated using the `outerContainer` width.

Consequently, the toolbar was given a width of `0`, resulting in the toolbar collapsing to the minimum width.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, a check has been introduced to prevent the adjustment of the toolbar’s width if the calculated value is `0`.

As a result, the inline editor now correctly displays the toolbar’s width when positioned inside a scrollable container.

example setup
```
tinymce.init({
  selector: "div",
  inline: true,
  toolbar_persist: true
});
```

As a consequence, this would result in the menubar and/or the toolbar to be squashed when the host browser was operating over a relatively slow connection.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the toolbar is no longer squashed in `inline` mode with `toolbar_persist` enabled, when the page takes longer to load the skin.

### Fixed incorrect object processor for `event_root` option.

Previously in TinyMCE, the `inline` mode `event_root` option incorrectly used an `object` processor.

This caused the option to be unregistered when passing a `string` value, resulting in the option being unusable.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this, now, the `event_root` option uses the correctly uses the `string` processor.

As the result, the `event_root` option can now be correctly used to specify a CSS selector for an element.

### Adding newline after using `selection.setContent` to insert a block element would throw an unhandled exception.

Previously in TinyMCE, there was an issue with `selection.setContent` when using certain tags (such as `pre`) as the parent element. The selection would not recognize that it was at the end of the line, resulting in an error when trying to insert a new line afterwards.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue. The selection now correctly recognizes that it is at the end of the line when using `selection.setContent`. As a result, the insertion of a new line behaves as expected.

### Floating toolbar buttons in inline editor incorrectly wrapped into multiple rows on window resizing or zooming.

An issue was identified where the floating toolbar’s functionality, specifically regarding the incorrect rendering of the overflow button on a second row when the window was resized or the browser was zoomed.

Previously, when the toolbar contained more buttons than could be displayed within the available space, an overflow button (depicted by three dots) `…​` would appear at the toolbar’s end, enabling users to access the remaining buttons. However, due to a bug, this overflow button would occasionally shift to a second row, disrupting the layout, especially during window resizing.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, by adding improvements to the resizing behavior of the toolbar to ensure it consistently fits within one row.

As a result, the toolbar now adjusts its size appropriately and maintains a single-row layout, effectively preventing the overflow button from erroneously moving to a second row under any circumstances.

### When setting table border width to 0 and `table_style_by_css` is `true`, only the border attribute is set to 0 and border-width styling is no longer used.

Previously in TinyMCE 6, when the `table_style_by_css` option was `true` and the table border width was set to `0px` within the "Table Properties" dialog, the table’s border attribute would be set to 1 and `border-width: 0px` would be applied to all cells in the table. This behaviour was unintentional and differed from setting the `table_style_by_css` option to `true` in TinyMCE 5.

In TinyMCE 7.0 addressed this issue. Now, setting the border width to 0 consistently sets the table border attribute to 0, removing `border-width` styles from all table cells, and aligning the behavior of the "Border width" property with TinyMCE 5.

### Clicking to the left or right of a non-editable `div` in Firefox would show two cursors.

Previously in Firefox, when the `FakeCaret` was rendered, in some cases the real caret was incorrectly rendered too.

As a consequence, the `FakeCaret` was visible at the same time as the real caret which should have been `hidden`.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this issue, now, the container containing the real caret, when we render the `FakeCaret`, is styled with `'caret-color': 'transparent'`.

As a result, the real caret is now hidden when TinyMCE renders the `FakeCaret`.

### The `mceTablePasteRowAfter` command, `mceTablePasteColAfter` command, `"Paste row after"` menu item and `"Paste column after"` menu item now place the cursor in the newly pasted row/column to be consistent with the other pasting operations.

Previously, the cursor position was incorrectly calculated after pasting a new row or column when using the `mceTablePasteRowAfter` command, `mceTablePasteColAfter` command, or `"Paste row after"` and `"Paste column after"` UI menu items.

As a consequence, after pasting, the cursor remained in the same position instead of moving to the newly pasted row or column.

TinyMCE 7.0 addresses this, fixing the cursor calculation.

Now, when using the `mceTablePasteRowAfter` command, `mceTablePasteColAfter` command, or `"Paste row after"` and `"Paste column after"` UI menu items, the cursor is correctly positioned in the newly pasted row or column as expected.

## Security fixes

TinyMCE 7.0.0 includes two fixes for the following security issues:

### TinyMCE Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in handling iframes

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content insertion code. This allowed `iframe` elements containing malicious code to execute when inserted into the editor. These `iframe` elements are restricted in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations such as downloading of malicious assets.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new [sandbox iframes](../content-filtering/#sandbox-iframes) boolean option which adds the `sandbox=""` attribute to every `iframe` element by default when enabled. This will prevent cross-origin, and in special cases same-origin, XSS by embedded resources in `iframe` elements. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards the default value of this option is `true`.

In TinyMCE 7.0.0 a new [`sandbox_iframes_exclusions`](../content-filtering/#sandbox-iframes-exclusions) option was also added, allowing a list of domains to be specified that should be excluded from having the `sandbox=""` attribute applied when the `sandbox_iframes` option is enabled. By default, this option is set to an array of domains that are provided in embed code by popular websites. To sandbox iframe elements from every domain, set this option to [].

### TinyMCE Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in handling external SVG files through Object or Embed elements

A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.

TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new [convert\_unsafe\_embeds](../content-filtering/#convert-unsafe-embeds) option to automatically convert `object` and `embed` elements respective of their type attribute. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards, the `convert_unsafe_embeds` option is enabled by default.

|  | If you are using TinyMCE 6.8.1 or higher, set `convert_unsafe_embeds` to `true`. For any earlier versions, a custom NodeFilter is recommended to remove or modify any `object` or `embed` elements. This can be added using the `editor.parser.addNodeFilter` and `editor.serializer.addNodeFilter` APIs. |

## Known issues

This section describes issues that users of TinyMCE 7.0 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

### Non-breaking spaces `&nbsp;` may be inadvertently inserted around content during Markdown conversion.

Currently, Non-breaking spaces `&nbsp;` may be inadvertently inserted around content inside `<p> </p>` during Markdown conversion, requiring users to manually remove them post-conversion as the current workaround.

Example of unexpected insertion of `&nbsp;`
```
<p>&nbsp;</p> // unexpected
<h3>Heading</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p> // unexpected
```

|  | This issue [is addressed](../7.0.1-release-notes/#pasting-markdown-into-some-situations-would-cause-the-pasted-data-to-be-placed-in-unexpected-places) in TinyMCE 7.0.1. |
| --- | --- |

### Tab navigation inside the Enhanced Code Editor function as expected when the host browser is Safari.

Tab navigation inside the Enhanced Code Editor does not function as expected when the host browser is Safari, as tab-key navigation through browser elements is not enabled by default on MacOS.

|  | Keyboard navigation is essential for accessibility. While tab-key navigation is supported by default on Windows, MacOS requires users to manually enable it within their browser or system settings.   1. Launch your Safari browser. 2. Navigate to the Safari menu on the menu bar and select Preferences. 3. Click on the Advanced tab. 4. Enable the accessibility option: "Press Tab to highlight each item on a web page"   Setting this checkbox will ensure Safari functions properly with tab-key navigation through browser elements. |
| --- | --- |

### Incorrect text color display with TinyMCE `skin: 'oxide-dark'`.

Enhanced Code Editor currently has an issue with the display of text color when TinyMCE is set to `skin: 'oxide-dark'`. When this setting is applied, the text color inside the Enhanced Code Editor does not display correctly.

Workaround:

1. Open the Advanced Code (advcode) dialog.
2. Click on the `Dark/light mode` button within the dialog.

   1. This action will set the text color to white on a black background, resolving the display issue temporarily.

|  | This workaround serves as a temporary solution until a permanent fix is implemented. |
| --- | --- |

### Table that has `colgroup` attribute is highlighted as new in Revision History.

When a `table` element has `colgroup` attribute, Revision History highlights it as new even though it has no change.

Currently, there is no current workaround for this issue.

### Revision History has no integration for saving a version.

For now, the current workaround is to add a custom toolbar button.

Example
```
const revisions = [];

tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea', // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'revisionhistory',
  toolbar: 'revisionhistory saveversion',
  setup: (editor) => {
    // Save the current content of the editor as a new version
    editor.ui.registry.addButton('saveversion', {
      text: 'Save a version',
      onAction: () => {
        // Change this according to your setup
        const revision = {
          content: editor.getContent({ format: 'raw' }),
          revisionId: (revisions.length + 1).toString(),
          createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
        };
        revisions.unshift(revision);
      }
    });
  },
  revisionhistory_fetch: () => Promise.resolve(revisions)
});
```

## Description

### Impact

A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.

### Fix

TinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new `convert_unsafe_embeds` option to automatically convert `object` and `embed` elements respective of their `type` attribute. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards, the `convert_unsafe_embeds` option is enabled by default.

### Workarounds

If you are using TinyMCE 6.8.1 or higher, set `convert_unsafe_embeds` to true. For any earlier versions, a custom NodeFilter is recommended to remove or modify any `object` or `embed` elements. This can be added using the `editor.parser.addNodeFilter` and `editor.serializer.addNodeFilter` APIs.

### Acknowledgements

Tiny Technologies would like to thank Toni Huttunen of [Fraktal Oy](https://www.fraktal.fi/) for discovering this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
