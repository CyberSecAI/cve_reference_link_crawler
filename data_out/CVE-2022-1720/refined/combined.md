Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
