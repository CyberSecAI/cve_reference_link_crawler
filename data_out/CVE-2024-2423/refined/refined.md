Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the UsersWP plugin's shortcode(s). Specifically, the `user-title` widget was vulnerable to stored XSS, because the `tag` attribute was not being properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows authenticated users (with contributor-level permissions or higher) to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `tag` attribute of the `user-title` widget shortcode. This code is then stored in the database and executed when other users access the page where the shortcode is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, which may lead to account compromise.
*   **Malware Injection:** It is possible for attackers to redirect users to malicious sites or inject malware into the page.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the website's content for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector involves an attacker with at least Contributor level permissions, injecting a malicious script via shortcode attribute on the WordPress site. The malicious code is stored in the database.
*   **Web Page Access:** The injected script will execute when other users (including administrators) visit the page where the vulnerable shortcode is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least the Contributor role or higher.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker must be able to create or edit content and use the `user-title` widget shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.7 of the UsersWP plugin.
*   The fix includes sanitizing the tag attribute to only allow specific header tags (`h1` to `h6`).
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c of CERT PL.
