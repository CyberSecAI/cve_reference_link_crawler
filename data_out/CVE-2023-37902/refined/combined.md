# ecrecover can return undefined data for invalid signatures

Moderate

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-f5x6-7qgp-jhf3
Jul 25, 2023

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.3.9

## Patched versions

0.3.10

## Description

### Impact

the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify, see <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b058cf454b3bdc7e770e2b3cec83a0bcb48f55ee/core/vm/contracts.go#L188>. however, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0.

this means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature.

A contract search was performed. Most uses of `ecrecover` are used for erc2612-style permit implementations, which typically look like:

```
    assert _owner != empty(address)
    assert block.timestamp <= _deadline

    nonce: uint256 = self.nonces[_owner]
    digest: bytes32 = keccak256(
        concat(
            b"\x19\x01",
            self.DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(_abi_encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, _owner, _spender, _value, nonce, _deadline))
        )
    )
    assert ecrecover(digest, convert(_v, uint256), convert(_r, uint256), convert(_s, uint256)) == _owner
```

in this case, the immutable `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is loaded into `ecrecover`'s output buffer right before `ecrecover()`, and so the output of `ecrecover()` here when the signature is invalid will be the value of `PERMIT_TYPEHASH`. in this case, since `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is not a valid address, it will never compare `==` to `_owner`, and so the behaviour is exactly the same as if `ecrecover()` returned 0 in this case.

in general, a contract could have unexpected behavior (i.e. mistakenly pass this style of signature check) if an immutable representing a real address (ex. `OWNER`) was read right before the `ecrecover` operation.

### Patches

v0.3.10 (with [019a37a](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/019a37ab98ff53f04fecfadf602b6cd5ac748f7f) and [#3586](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3586))

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-37902

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
