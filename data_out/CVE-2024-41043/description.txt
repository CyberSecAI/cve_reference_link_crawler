In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: drop bogus WARN_ON

Happens when rules get flushed/deleted while packet is out, so remove
this WARN_ON.

This WARN exists in one form or another since v4.14, no need to backport
this to older releases, hence use a more recent fixes tag.
