Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient filtering of template attributes during the creation of HTML for custom widgets in the "Unlimited Elements For Elementor" WordPress plugin. This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an OS command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to potentially steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin:** The vulnerability exists within the "Unlimited Elements For Elementor" WordPress plugin.
- **Template Attributes:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing template attributes during the rendering of custom widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.5.102.
- Version 1.5.103 and later versions contain the necessary fix to prevent this vulnerability.
- The provided code diff highlights changes in `unitecreator_template_engine.class.php`, which seems to be related to handling of items from posts and post data in templates. While the diff doesn't directly expose the command injection, it points to areas where template processing occurs, which aligns with the vulnerability description.
- The code diff also introduces a function `validateFilterCallable` which checks if a passed callable function is in a list of forbidden functions such as `exec`, `eval`, `system`, etc. This is likely a part of the mitigation, but may not have been fully implemented prior to the fix for this vulnerability.
- The Wordfence article explicitly states the vulnerability is an **"Authenticated (Admin+) Command Injection"**
