- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists in the plugin and can be triggered by a user with subscriber privileges.
