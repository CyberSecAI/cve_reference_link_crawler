## Security Fixes

* Fix [CVE-2023-4759 Arbitrary File Overwrite](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4759)

## Bug Fixes

* [582039](https://eclip.se/582039) Express the explicit intention of creating bitmaps in GC to allow the GC.repack() phase to explicitly generate bitmaps only for the heads packfile and not for the others.
* [581532](https://eclip.se/581532) GC: prune all packfiles after the loosen phase. This prevents a series of exceptions previously thrown when loosening the packfiles.
* [582044](https://eclip.se/582044) Revert "RefDirectory: Throw exception if compare-and-swap of packed ref list fails"
