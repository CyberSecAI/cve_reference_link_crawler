In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: ops: Check bounds for second channel in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx()

The bounds checks in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx() are only being applied to the
first channel, meaning it is possible to write out of bounds values to the
second channel in stereo controls. Add appropriate checks.
