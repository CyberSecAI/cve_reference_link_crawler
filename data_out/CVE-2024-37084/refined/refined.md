- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the upload path in the Skipper server, allowing a malicious user to write arbitrary files to any location on the file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation and path sanitization during file uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution by writing arbitrary files to the server's file system, potentially leading to server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted upload requests to the Skipper server API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the Skipper server API. The document notes that this API is not exposed to external users, making exploitation less likely.
