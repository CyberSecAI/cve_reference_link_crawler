- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input in the username parameter during the admin login process, directly embedding it into the SQL query without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/rental_0/rental/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint. Specifically, the username parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database, modify data, execute administration operations, potentially recover content from the DBMS file system, and issue commands to the operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, injecting SQL code via the `username` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server, which can often be done remotely if the application is accessible over a network. The attacker also needs a method to craft the SQL injection payload.
