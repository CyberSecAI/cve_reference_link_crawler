- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Consul HTTP server response did not explicitly specify a `Content-Type` header, which allowed user-provided inputs to be interpreted as a different content-type. Go's `net/http` package attempts to guess and set the `Content-Type` of the HTTP response based on the HTTP request body content value when a `Content-Type` is not explicitly set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of explicit `Content-Type` header in HTTP responses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can perform reflected XSS attacks, potentially leading to account takeovers.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the HTTP request body content, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that the server will interpret and return as part of the response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Consul server.
