Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider in the Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin handles credentials created via the Blue Ocean pipeline creation wizard. These credentials are stored in the per-user credentials store, and the plugin allows pipelines to access them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Credential Access:** The Blue Ocean Credentials Provider allows pipelines to access credentials stored in a per-user credential store.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers with `Job/Configure` permission can rewrite job configurations to access attacker-specified credentials from any user's private credential store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers can access and capture sensitive credentials from other users' private credential stores. This can lead to further unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by the captured credentials.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive information contained within the captured credentials can be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Job Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers must have the ability to configure Jenkins jobs. This can be achieved through having the 'Job/Configure' permission.
*   **Rewriting Job Configurations:** Attackers need to rewrite job configurations in a way to use the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and request an arbitrary credential.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Job/Configure Permission:** An attacker must possess `Job/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job.
*   **Knowledge of Credential Store Location:** While not stated directly, the attacker would need knowledge of the credential store's location within the Blue Ocean plugin.
*  **Ability to Rewrite Job Configurations:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify existing job configurations to inject the malicious credential retrieval code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.4 by deprecating the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and disabling it by default.
*   Administrators are advised to reconfigure affected pipelines to use credentials from the Jenkins credential store or a folder credential store.
*  It is possible to re-enable the unsafe functionality via a system property, which is highly discouraged.
* The vulnerability is specific to pipelines created using the pipeline creation wizard in Blue Ocean.
