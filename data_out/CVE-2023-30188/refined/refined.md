Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-30188:

**Vulnerability:** Memory Exhaustion

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `Save_Alloc` function within the `CNativeControl` class in ONLYOFFICE Document Server. This function allows a user to allocate a new chunk of memory of an arbitrary size, initialized with `0xff`. The allocated memory is not released, therefore, calling this function in an infinite loop leads to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation via the `Save_Alloc` function, lacking a mechanism to release allocated memory.
- Lack of validation or limits on the size or number of allocations, allowing for unlimited allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) on the Document Server application.
- Potential denial of service on the host system due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted JavaScript file to the `/docbuilder` API route.
- This API requires a JWT token for requests, but any valid user, including an attacker, can obtain these tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the ONLYOFFICE Document Server's `/docbuilder` endpoint.
- Knowledge of a valid JWT token to interact with the `/docbuilder` API after version 7.2.
- Ability to craft a JavaScript file containing the malicious code to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The `CNativeControl` class has a `m_pSaveBinary` pointer and `m_nSaveLen` variable to manage allocated memory.
- The `Save_Alloc` function allocates memory using `new BYTE[m_nSaveLen]` without a corresponding `delete`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `Save_Alloc` is called repeatedly in a loop.

**Additional Information from provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in ONLYOFFICE Document Server versions 4.0.3 through 7.3.2.
- The provided fix involves removing the vulnerable `Save_Alloc` and `Save_ReAlloc` functionalities from `DesktopEditor/doctrenderer/embed/jsc/jsc_NativeControl.mm`.
- A sample JavaScript code is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability:

```javascript
builder.CreateFile("docx");

engine = CreateNativeEngine();

while (true) {
    engine.Save_AllocNative(0x808);
}
```
- The vulnerable code is present in both the JSC and V8 embedding of the JavaScript engine
- The vulnerability is reachable through the `/docbuilder` API which is used to execute custom js files and generate documents.
