- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) is susceptible to a Directory Traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory Traversal, leading to Remote Code Execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request that leverages the directory traversal weakness.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. Network access to the vulnerable service is required.
