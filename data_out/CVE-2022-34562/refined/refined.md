- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization in the status box allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary web scripts or HTML can be executed, leading to potential session hijacking, credential theft, or manipulation of user interactions.
- **Attack vectors:**
  1.  An attacker creates a post containing an XSS payload in the status box.
  2.  The attacker mentions another user in the comments of that post.
  3.  The mentioned user receives a notification and when they try to view the post, the XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the platform and have the ability to create posts and mention other users. The targeted user needs to be a user on the platform who will view the post.
