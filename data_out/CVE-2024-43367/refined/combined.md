# JavaScript specification issue may lead to type confusion, pointer dereference, and uncaught exception in implementations

High

Aug 13, 2024

## Package

ECMA-262

## Affected versions

>=2022, <2025

## Patched versions

2025

## Description

## Impact

A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a [May 2021 spec refactor](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2413), may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as type confusion, pointer dereference, and uncaught exception.

### Details

The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.

## Fix

The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to [the latest specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-asyncgenerator-objects) and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Package

cargo

boa\_engine
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>=0.16, <0.19.0

## Patched versions

0.19.0

## Description

A wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts.

## Details

Boa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`.

However, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user.

## Patches

Version 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case.

## Workarounds

Users unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use [`std::panic::catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html) to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
