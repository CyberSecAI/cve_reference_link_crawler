- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unverified password change vulnerability exists in FortiADC due to a lack of proper verification of the old password during the password change process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-620 (Missing Password Change Verification) - The application fails to properly verify the old password before allowing a password change.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can bypass the old password check when changing the password of the account they are logged into or other accounts (except 'admin'). This allows the attacker to change the password of an existing account without knowing the old password, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP request to the FortiADC web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with read-write access on System to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be a user with regular login credentials.
