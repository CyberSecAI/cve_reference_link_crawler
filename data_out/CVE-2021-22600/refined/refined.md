Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET) implementation within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue arises from incorrect memory freeing within this module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect memory freeing. The code was freeing memory that was already freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to:
  - Denial of service (memory corruption or crash)
  - Potential privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**
- Local user access is required.
- The attacker needs the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability. This capability can be acquired in any user namespace.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the system
- Ability to obtain the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the syzbot tool.
- The fix involves a change in `net/packet/af_packet.c` to ensure `rx_owner_map` is only freed if a packet ring (`pg_vec`) was allocated.
- This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to the fixes.
- Netapp also states that multiple NetApp products incorporate Linux Kernel, and a successful exploit could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or DoS. They provide a list of affected products.
