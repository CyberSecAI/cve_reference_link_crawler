- **Root cause:** A logic issue within AppKit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** An unprivileged application is able to log keystrokes in other applications, even when those applications use secure input mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, like passwords or personal messages, by logging keystrokes from other applications.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious, unprivileged application needs to be installed on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to install an application on the target macOS system.
