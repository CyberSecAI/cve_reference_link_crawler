  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization in the 'wiscan.scan' function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By supplying malicious input to the 'wiscan.scan' function. The attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `wiscan.scan` function with a malicious string as input. No privileges are required prior to the attack."
