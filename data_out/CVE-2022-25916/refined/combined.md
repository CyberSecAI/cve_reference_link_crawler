### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

[CVE-2022-25916  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25916) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-78  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `mt7688-wiscan` to version 0.8.3 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection due to improper input sanitization in the 'wiscan.scan' function.

## PoC

```
var wiscan = require('mt7688-wiscan');
wiscan.scan(';touch EXPLOITED;#', function(){});

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.4 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*Arguments:\*\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1. `intf` (\_String\_, optional): A default value of `'ra0'` will be used if not given. |
|  |  | 2. `essid` (\_String\_): The ESSID of the AP to scan for. |
|  |  | 3. `callback` (\_Function\_): `function(err, result) { ... }`. The `result` is a number between 0 and 100 to indicate the relative link quality between the station and access point. The value is bigger to show better link quality. If given 'essid' is not found after scan, `result` will be `null`. |

|  |  | \*\*[Note]\*\* |
|  |  | \* It takes around 5 seconds to accomplish a single scan. |
