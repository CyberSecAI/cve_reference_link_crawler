Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input within the `/Employee/changepassword.php` page of the Prison Management System. Specifically, the `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, and `txtconfirm_password` parameters are directly echoed back into the HTML without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a reflected XSS vulnerability due to the unsanitized user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute within the context of the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies or other sensitive information
  - Defacing the web page
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/Employee/changepassword.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker includes malicious JavaScript code within the values of the `txtold_password`, `txtnew_password`, or `txtconfirm_password` parameters of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to access the vulnerable page.
- The attacker can potentially exploit this via a malicious link, or by injecting the payload into a form themselves, then using social engineering to get the victim to submit the form.

**Additional Details:**

- The content provides a specific payload example: `"><svg/onload=alert``>`.
- It includes a sample Burp request demonstrating how an attacker would exploit this vulnerability.
- It lists the affected software as "SourceCodester Prison Management System 1.0".
- It specifies that the vulnerability was tested on a PHP, Apache, and MySQL environment.
- It provides valid login credentials for testing the application.
- It includes screenshots demonstrating the successful execution of the XSS payload.
