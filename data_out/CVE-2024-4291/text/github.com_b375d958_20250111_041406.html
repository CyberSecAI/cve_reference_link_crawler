# Tenda A301 v2.0 US\_A301V2.0RTL\_V15.13.08.12\_multi\_TDE01 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the deviceList parameter in the formAddMacfilterRule function.

## Vulnerability Description

Vendor: Tenda

Product: A301 v2.0

Version: US\_A301V2.0RTL\_V15.13.08.12\_multi\_TDE01

Type: Buffer Overflow

Firmware link: <https://www.tendacn.com/download/detail-3328.html>

## Vulnerability Details

In formAddMacfilterRule function, get deviceList via websGetVar and pass first argument to parse\_macfilter\_rule

[![1706007607087](/L1ziang/Vulnerability/raw/main/image/formAddMacfilterRule/1706007607087.png)](/L1ziang/Vulnerability/blob/main/image/formAddMacfilterRule/1706007607087.png)

The parse\_macfilter\_rule function, however, is not passed to the dest\_rule->name variable via strcpy without any length checksum, which could lead to an attacker using this buffer overflow to perform a DOS attack and an RCE attack.
