Last RevisedJuly 06, 2021
Alert CodeICSA-21-187-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Moxa
* **Equipment:** NPort IAW5000A-I/O Series Wireless Device Server
* **Vulnerabilities:** Classic Buffer Overflow, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input Validation, OS Command Injection

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed, cause a buffer overflow condition, or allow remote code execution.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Moxa reports these vulnerabilities affect the following wireless device server:

* NPort IAW5000A-I/O Series firmware Version 2.2 or earlier

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [CLASSIC BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)

Two buffer overflows in the built-in web server may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2021-32968](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32968) has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)

Five buffer overflows in the built-in web server allow a remote attacker to initiate a denial-of-service attack and execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2021-32976](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32976) has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

Data can be copied without validation in the built-in web server, which may allow a remote attacker to cause denial-of-service conditions.

[CVE-2021-32970](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32970) has been assigned to these vulnerabilities. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [OS COMMAND INJECTION CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)

Improper input validation in the built-in web server may allow a remote attacker to execute commands.

[CVE-2021-32974](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-32974) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Konstantin Kondratev, Evgeniy Druzhinin and Ilya Karpov of Rostelecom-Solar reported these vulnerabilities to Moxa.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Moxa has developed solutions to address these vulnerabilities. Please contact [Moxa Technical Support](https://www.moxa.com/support/support/technical-support) for a security patch.

Moxa has also published a [security advisory](https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/security-advisory/nport-iaw5000a-io-serial-device-server-vulnerabilities) to provide more information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
