|  | CVE-2023-28452 |
| --- | --- |
|  | > [Suggested description] |
|  | > An issue was discovered in CoreDNS through 1.10.1. |
|  | > There is a vulnerability (called TuDoor Attack) in DNS resolving software, |
|  | > which triggers a resolver to ignore valid responses, thus causing DoS |
|  | > (denial of service) for normal resolution. The effects of an exploit |
|  | > would be widespread and highly impactful, because the attacker could just |
|  | > forge a response targeting the source port of a vulnerable resolver |
|  | > without the need to guess the correct TXID. |
