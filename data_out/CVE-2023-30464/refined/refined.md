{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a birthday attack that allows attackers to inject fake DNS responses.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "DNS cache poisoning (TuDoor for birthday-based cache poisoning). The system does not properly validate DNS responses, allowing an attacker to inject malicious responses.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to DNS cache poisoning, allowing attackers to redirect traffic to malicious servers.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers send a query to CoreDNS and inject fake DNS responses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable CoreDNS server."
