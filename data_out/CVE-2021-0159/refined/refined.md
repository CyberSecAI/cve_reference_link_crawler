Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to "Improper input validation" in the BIOS authenticated code module for some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The BIOS authenticated code module does not properly validate input, which can lead to further vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to escalate their privileges.
*   Other impacts like sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service are not mentioned specifically for CVE-2021-0159, though the broader advisory indicates those impacts are possible for other related CVEs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via local access to the system.
*   **Privileged User:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
