The content is related to CVE-2021-26076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `jira.editor.user.mode` cookie, set by the Jira Editor Plugin, lacks the `secure` attribute when Jira is configured to use HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The absence of the `secure` attribute on the `jira.editor.user.mode` cookie. This allows an attacker to intercept the cookie over an insecure (HTTP) connection even when the website is accessed over HTTPS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can learn the editing mode a user is using.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user and the Jira server (MitM attack).
- The attacker must be able to see the network traffic when the user is accessing the Jira instance over HTTP even if the application is configured for HTTPS.
