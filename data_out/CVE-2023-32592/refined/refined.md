- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Sunny Search Plugin <= 1.0.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case, but it could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the victim's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and lure a logged-in user to execute it (e.g., through a malicious link or website). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
