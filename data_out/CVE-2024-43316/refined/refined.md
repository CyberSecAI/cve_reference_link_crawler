- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform unwanted actions within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into triggering the malicious request.
