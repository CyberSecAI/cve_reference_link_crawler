| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2319036#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-16 01:01:45 UTC  ``` There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-41128](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-41128).  Impact ------  Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.   Releases -------- The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- Users on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.   Credits -------  Thanks to [scyoon](<https://hackerone.com/scyoon>) for the report and patches!   ``` |  |

# Possible ReDoS vulnerability in query parameter filtering in Action Dispatch

Low

[jhawthorn](/jhawthorn)
published
GHSA-x76w-6vjr-8xgj
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

bundler

actionpack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 3.1.0, < 6.1.7.9
>= 7.0.0, < 7.0.8.5
>= 7.1.0, < 7.1.4.1
>= 7.2.0, < 7.2.1.1

## Patched versions

6.1.7.9
7.0.8.5
7.1.4.1
7.2.1.1

## Description

There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-41128](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x76w-6vjr-8xgj "CVE-2024-41128").

## Impact

Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.

Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

Users on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.

## Credits

Thanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon) for the report and patches!
