**Root Cause:**
A flaw in the resolver code of BIND 9 causes the server to spend excessive time processing large DNS delegations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The resolver code is inefficient in handling large delegations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The excessive time spent processing large delegations can severely degrade resolver performance and lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the DNS server unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted DNS queries that result in the server having to handle large delegations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending malicious DNS queries. The attacker does not require any prior privileges or access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is described as a "processing large delegations may severely degrade resolver performance".
- This vulnerability is publicly known.
- NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of BIND are also impacted.
