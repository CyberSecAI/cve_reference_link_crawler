The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities found in BandiView v7.05:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation when loading crafted JXR files. Specifically, when the code encounters an unsupported content type, it fails to handle it correctly, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient checks for supported file content during parsing and lack of proper exception handling.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application crashes due to an access violation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious JXR files disguised with other image file extensions can be loaded via the application's file loading mechanism.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JXR file with specific content that triggers the vulnerable code path. The attacker also needs to have the user open the crafted file with BandiView.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient verification of PSD files.
*  **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input validation when processing PSD files, leading to stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Buffer Overflow, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The application crashes due to a stack buffer overrun.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious PSD file is loaded using BandiView’s file handling.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PSD file that overflows the buffer. The attacker also needs to have the user open the crafted file with BandiView.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation when loading crafted PSD files, similar to Vulnerability 2 but triggering a different crash.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient verification of PSD file content.
*  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application crashes due to an access violation
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious PSD file loaded via BandiView’s file handling mechanism.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PSD file that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to have the user open the crafted file with BandiView.

The report also provides the following information:

*   **Affected Software:** BandiView v7.05 (2024/7/15, BuildNo=26122)
*   **Operating Systems:** Vulnerability 1 tested on Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and Vulnerability 2 and 3 tested on Windows 11 Pro 23H2.
*   **Mitigation:** Strengthen exception handling in the image loading function.
*   **Discovery Method:** Fuzz testing and debugging.
