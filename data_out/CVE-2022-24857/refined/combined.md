## 0.14.0 (2024-12-06)

* Use `autocomplete="one-time-code"` on form inputs
* Set `Auto-Submitted` header in emails
* Align handling of localhost as a secure context with upstream. Notably,
  this means that `DEBUG` no longer has any effect and that `127.0.0.1` is no
  longer treated as a secure context.
* Drop support for Python 3.8

## 0.13.0 (2024-06-18)

* Add suport for `LoginRequiredMiddleware` from django 5.1

## 0.12.1 (2024-03-26)

* Fix failed package build

## 0.12.0 (2024-03-26)

* Set ID field independent of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`
* Add support for async in `MFAEnforceMiddleware`
* Fix: include `login_failed_subject.txt` in package
* Add support for django 5.0, drop support for django 4.1
* Add support for python 3.12, drop support for python 3.7
* Replace setup.py by pyproject.toml

## 0.11.0 (2023-04-14)

* Add setting `MFA_FIDO2_USER_VERIFICATION`
* Allow to use FIDO2 on localhost without HTTPS if DEBUG is True (thanks to
  humphrey)
* Avoid autocompletion in the code field
* Fix minimum supported django version (3.2) in the package

## 0.10.0 (2023-03-19)

* Add french translation (thanks to hleroy)

## 0.9.0 (2023-02-27)

* Autofocus in auth form
* Work around rendering bug in qrcode (see
  [lincolnloop/python-qrcode#317](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode/issues/317))

## 0.8.0 (2022-12-08)

* Add option to send an email on failed login

## 0.7.0 (2022-06-24)

* Add new setting `MFA_TOTP_VALID_WINDOW` to compensate for clock drifts
  (thanks to Tobias Bölz)

## 0.6.0 (2022-06-08)

* Adapt to fido2 1.0.0

## 0.5.1 (2022-06-08)

* Pin fido2 dependency

## 0.5.0 (2022-04-15)

* Security fix: The admin login was not adapted, so it could be used to
  bypass MFA. As a fix, django-mfa3 will now automatically patch `AdminSite`
  so the admin login redirects to regular login. (CVE-2022-24857)
* Drop support for django 2.2
* Use a more efficient string encoding for FIDO2 messages

## 0.4.0 (2022-01-25)

* Drop support for python 3.6, add support for python 3.10
* Drop support for django 3.1, add support for django 4.0
* No longer include MFA code in credentials for `user_login_failed`

## 0.3.0 (2021-08-25)

* Add recovery codes. Check the example templates for references to
  "recovery" to see what needs to be changed.
* Add new setting `MFA_METHODS` to change the set of enabled methods.

## 0.2.5 (2021-07-18)

* Fix usage with custom User models that use a different username field
  (thanks to Ashok Argent-Katwala)

## 0.2.4 (2021-07-07)

* Security fix: Do not allow users to see the names of/delete other user's
  keys (secrets were not leaked)

## 0.2.3 (2021-07-05)

* Fix packaging: include .mo files

## 0.2.2 (2021-07-05)

* Fix packaging: include templatetags

## 0.2.1 (2021-07-02)

* Fix packaging: exclude tests

## 0.2.0 (2021-07-02)

* Fix form validation on missing code
* Add german translation
* Use `never_cache` and `sensitive_post_parameters` decorators
* Do not generate a new challenge on validation errors

## 0.1.0 (2021-06-29)

* Trigger `user_login_failed` on failed second factor. This can be used to
  integrating with external rate limiting solutions such as django-axes.
* Fix: include JS files in python package

* Convenience: redirect to TOTP auth if no FIDO2 key exists
* Add optional `MFAEnforceMiddleware`

# Multi factor authentication bypass via admin login

High

[xi](/xi)
published
GHSA-3r7g-wrpr-j5g4
Apr 15, 2022

## Package

pip

django-mfa3
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0

## Patched versions

0.5.0

## Description

### Impact

django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed.

You are affected if you have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0.

### Workarounds

It is possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition *before* the admin routes:

```
url('admin/login/', lambda request: redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)

```
### References

* [django-mfa3 changelog](https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/blob/main/CHANGES.md#050-2022-04-15)

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24857

### Weaknesses
