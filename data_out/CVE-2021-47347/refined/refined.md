- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `wl1251_cmd_scan` function in the `wl1251` driver copies the SSID using `memcpy` without validating the length of the provided SSID, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `wl1251_cmd_scan` function due to the lack of length validation before using `memcpy` to copy the SSID.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or achieve arbitrary code execution by providing an overly long SSID during a scan operation, overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted scan command with a long SSID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to trigger a scan request with a user-controlled SSID on a system using a vulnerable `wl1251` driver.
