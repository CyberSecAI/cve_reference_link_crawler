- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Authentication Required**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System.
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `getFilterString` method.
- NETGEAR has released a patch in version 1.7.0.37 of the NMS300 software.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-23399.
