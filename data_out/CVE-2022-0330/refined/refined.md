  "cveId": "CVE-2022-0330",
  "description": "A missing GPU TLB flush has been discovered in the i915 kernel driver which could be exploited by malicious userspace. When the GPU is not running behind an active IOMMU, malicious userspace can gain access (from the code executing on the GPU) to random memory pages. When an IOMMU is present, malicious userspace can trigger DMAR read/write faults logged to the kernel log. The underlying reason for the memory access vulnerability is a missing TLB flush upon releasing memory. All Intel integrated and discrete GPUs starting from Gen8 (Broadwell) are affected.",
  "technicalDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) flush in the i915 kernel driver when releasing memory that was previously used by a GPU buffer object.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing TLB flush when releasing memory used by GPU buffer objects.",
        "The driver assumes that flushing the TLB at the start of every userspace GPU execution is sufficient."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n\t- Disclosure of sensitive information.\n\t- Addition or modification of data due to memory corruption.\n\t- Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attackVectors": [
         "Malicious userspace code can exploit the vulnerability.",
         "If IOMMU is not active, the GPU can access random memory pages.",
         "If IOMMU is active, the malicious userspace can trigger DMAR read/write faults.",
         "Userspace can avoid declaring all memory accesses, allowing the GPU to continue accessing memory after it is released."
       ],
       "requiredCapabilities": "Local user with the ability to execute code on the GPU."

        "remediation": "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S, and NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C have no plans to address this vulnerability. See the EOA announcement for more information."
