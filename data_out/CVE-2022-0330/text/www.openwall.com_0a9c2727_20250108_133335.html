Subject: Linux kernel: Security sensitive bug in the i915 kernel driver​ (CVE-2022-0330)

[This is a public disclosure of an issue reported 7 days ago to
linux-distros at openwall. CVE-2022-0330 has been assigned to the
issue since.]

Hi all,

A missing GPU TLB flush has been discovered in the i915 kernel driver
which could be exploited by malicious userspace and can manifest in two
flavours, depending on whether the GPU is running behind an active IOMMU
(address translation) or not:

1. IOMMU with address translation - malicious userspace can trigger DMAR
read/write faults getting logged to the kernel log.

2. Without an active IOMMU malicious userspace can gain access (from the
code executing on the GPU) to random memory pages.

Second case is therefore the serious one.

It is currently not known whether specific memory could be targeted, but
random memory corruption or data leaks are a known possibility.

Underlying reason for the access to memory not owned is a missing TLB
flush upon releasing memory which used to back a GPU buffer object back
to the system.

Flawed assumption was that flushing the TLB at the start of every
userspace GPU execution is sufficient, given the programming model where
userspace is expected to declare which graphics virtual memory address
ranges it will be accessing at the start of every execution. However
what was not considered is that userspace can legitimately (it is
allowed in uapi) _not_ declare those accesses.

This allows userspace to continue GPU access to memory, while the kernel
driver (i915) is unaware of it being in use, and therefore is allowed to
release the backing store back to the system. Should the system then
give out those pages back for a different use, the exploit situation can
arise.

Return of the pages back to the system can either be specifically
engineered by the malicious software, or can happen innocently via
system memory pressure.

All Intel integrated and discrete GPUs starting from Gen8 (Broadwell)
are affected.

Fix has already been developed and consists of explicitly flushing the
TLBs before releasing memory back to the system for any GPU buffer
objects which were in use from the GPU.

Note that this will have a varying performance impact depending on the
specific GPU, GPU workload and overall system workload.

Fix for the issue has been provided to the Linus distributions and Linux
kernel maintainers and is expected to be merged to top of the tree and
stable and LTS releases shortly. Fix carries the title of "drm/i915:
Flush TLBs before releasing backing store".

Kind regards,

Tvrtko
