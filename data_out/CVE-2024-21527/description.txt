Versions of the package github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/v8/pkg/gotenberg before 8.1.0; versions of the package github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/v8/pkg/modules/chromium before 8.1.0; versions of the package github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/v8/pkg/modules/webhook before 8.1.0 are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the /convert/html endpoint when a request is made to a file via localhost, such as <iframe src="\\localhost/etc/passwd">. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve local file inclusion, allowing of sensitive files read on the host system. WorkaroundAn alternative is using either or both --chromium-deny-list and --chromium-allow-list flags.
