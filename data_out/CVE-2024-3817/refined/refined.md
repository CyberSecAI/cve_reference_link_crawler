- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The go-getter library is vulnerable to argument injection when executing Git to discover remote branches. Specifically, when a Git reference is not provided in the Git URL, go-getter attempts to determine the default branch by passing arguments to the Git binary. An attacker can manipulate the Git URL to inject additional Git arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Argument injection vulnerability in the go-getter library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The injected arguments can be used to potentially manipulate the git command execution. The specific impact depends on the injected arguments and the context of the go-getter usage, but it could potentially lead to unintended actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a Git URL with malicious arguments injected, which are then passed to the git command by go-getter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the Git URL provided to the go-getter library.
