- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data in Management Central.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service of network ports.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the deserialization of untrusted data within the Management Central component of IBM i.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send untrusted data to Management Central to trigger the deserialization vulnerability.
