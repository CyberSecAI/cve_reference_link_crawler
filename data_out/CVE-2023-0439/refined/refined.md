- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NEX-Forms plugin does not properly sanitize the form name when creating a new form. This allows for the injection of malicious code through the form name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to create forms can inject malicious JavaScript code within the form name field. When the form dashboard is accessed, the injected code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the capability to create new forms. By default, this is limited to SuperAdmins (in multisite) or admins (in single site). However, the plugin has a setting to allow lower-level roles access to this feature.
