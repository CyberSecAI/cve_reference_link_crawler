{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `url` parameter of a POST request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser when the crafted request is processed by the vulnerable application. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious redirects.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the `/emgui/rest/preferences/PREF_HOME_PAGE/sponsor/3/` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `url` parameter."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request to the specified endpoint. No specific authentication or privilege is mentioned but it is assumed to be a self-reflected XSS so the user interacting with the crafted url is most likely needed. "
