Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. When using the built-in `extract32(b, start)`, if the `start` index provided has for side effect to update `b`, the byte array to extract `32` bytes from, it could be that some dirty memory is read and returned by `extract32`. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.
