Reason RPV311

Flash Player EOL and hard-coded credentials on RPV311

Security Notice

GE Publication Number: GES-2021-005
Copyright © 2021 GE
Security: GE Proprietary Information – Public

Release Date: 26 March 2021
CVSS: See below in “Vulnerability details”
ICS-CERT Advisory:
CVE Identifier:

Overview

Zero Day Initiative OT Security Team found a vulnerability in GE Grid Solution Reason RPV311 multifunctional digital
fault recorder (DFR) including hard-coded credentials which could allow adversaries to partially take control of the DFR.
In  parallel  Adobe  has  discontinued  Flash  Player  plugin,  causing  security  concerns.  This  document  provides  more
information on the nature of these vulnerabilities as well as the recommended mitigation steps for RPV311 with the
affected firmware versions.

Background

RPV311 is a Multifunctional Digital Fault Recorder (DFR). GE’s Reason RPV311 has distributed architecture capable to
acquire  data  through  IEC  61850-9-2LE  sampled  value  subscription  or  proprietary  protocol  interface  with  remote
acquisition units RA331, RA332 or RA333, connected to conventional current and voltage transformers. The RPV311
calculate measures based on acquired data and is capable to generate fault, disturbance, continuous, steady-state and
sequence of events records with flexible thresholds and triggers configured by the user. As multifunctional platform,
the RPV311 also has capabilities for applications as PMU, power quality and precise fault location using Traveling Waves
methods.

The Multifunctional Digital Fault Recorder RPV311 is designed to be installed and operated in industrial and power sub-
station environments and connected to private networks.

RPV311 Vulnerabilities – Security Notice

Vulnerability details

The next vulnerabilities where found in RPV311:

•  Use of hard-coded password in the device. Adversaries could take limited control of the fault recorder using

some hard-coded credentials.

o  CVSS: 6.3 (severity medium)
o  Note that the impact is limited considering that the device is designed to be connected to private

networks, installed and operated in closed/protected industrial and power substation environments,
which reduces exploitability.

•  Use of Adobe Flash Player Plugin after EOL period (potential vulnerability no CVSS)

Thanks to Zero Day Initiative OT Security Team who initially reported the first vulnerability.

Affected products/versions

Products

RPV311

Versions

All firmware versions prior or equal to v14A03

Workarounds and mitigation

Considering the RPV311 is designed to be installed and operated in industrial and power substation environment, in
applications where it is not needed access to public networks, for the vulnerabilities herein described GE recommend
RPV311 devices to be protected using network defense-in-depth practices. This includes, but is not limited to, placing
RPV311 devices inside the control system network security perimeter, and having access controls, monitoring (such as
an Intrusion Detection System), and other mitigating technologies in place.

Regarding Flash player plugin, Adobe has decided the end-of-life for product due to vulnerabilities. To reduce risks of
existent vulnerabilities protective mechanisms for blocking access to malicious Flash Player movies were implemented.
To  overcome  these  mechanisms  in  a  safe  way  GE  recommends  the  users  to  update  Flash  Player  configuration  file
whitelisting the IP addresses of the desired RPV311 by following the procedure named “How to use Reason RPV311
