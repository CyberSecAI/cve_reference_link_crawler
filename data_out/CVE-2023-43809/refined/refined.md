Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43809:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the public key during the SSH handshake process when keyboard-interactive authentication is enabled and the `allow-keyless` setting is set to `true`. Specifically, when a client attempts to authenticate with a public key requiring additional client-side verification (e.g., using FIDO2, GPG, or a passphrase), the server initially accepts the public key identity. If the client-side verification fails, the authentication process falls back to the `keyboard-interactive` method. However, the server fails to invalidate the previously accepted public key identity, leading to a bypass of public key authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Public key authentication bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the intended public key authentication by intentionally failing client-side key verification and then using the `keyboard-interactive` method to gain access with the permissions of the initially accepted public key identity.
- **Insufficient validation:** The server does not properly validate that the key used for the connection is the same key used for authentication.
- **Incorrect handling of authentication fallbacks:** The server incorrectly handles the fallback to `keyboard-interactive` authentication after a failed public key authentication attempt.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Soft Serve instance, potentially gaining access to private repositories and administrative functions.
- **Privilege escalation:** The attacker gains access with the privileges associated with the initially accepted public key identity, which may be an administrative user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely via the SSH protocol.
- **Manipulated SSH requests:** The attacker needs to present manipulated SSH requests that initially include a valid public key (requiring client-side verification) and then trigger a fallback to keyboard-interactive authentication after failing the client-side verification.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Soft Serve server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand the vulnerability, specifically how the server handles public key authentication and fallback to keyboard-interactive method.
- **Ability to manipulate SSH requests:** The attacker must be able to construct and send SSH requests that can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Valid soft-serve user:** The attacker must know a valid username, to exploit the vulnerability by attempting authentication with a public key associated with that user.

The fix involves adding an authentication middleware that verifies the key used for establishing the connection matches the key used for authentication. The commit `407c4ec72d1006cee1ff8c1775e5bcc091c2bc89` implements this fix. It also resets the stored public key fingerprint if keyless access is allowed.
