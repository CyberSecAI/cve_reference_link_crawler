### **[JJGadgets](/JJGadgets)** commented [Sep 27, 2023](#issue-1916246880)

| **Describe the bug**  **Summary:** Identity: publickey identity accepted, not invalidated/revoked when client-side key verification and thus publickey authentication method fails Authentication: publickey method failed, but `allow-keyless` always returns successful authentication using `keyboard-interactive` method to allow open `anon-access` functionality Authorization: assumes publickey identity's account, authentication returns successful from `keyboard-interactive`, grants access  When `allow-keyless` server setting is set to `true`, the `keyboard-interactive` SSH authentication method is enabled, prioritized after `publickey` method.  If a client uses a keypair that requires additional client-side verification to complete authentication, the server first accepts the public key identity so the client can invoke the client-side verification.  When the client-side verification fails (e.g. bad passphrase, YubiKey not plugged in etc), the `publickey` method fails entirely (with failure message logged on client), and the next method, in this case `keyboard-interactive`, is used. From my understanding, for soft-serve, the correct flow would mean that this is the `anon-access` mode with no user account.  However, it was observed that the previously accepted identity is not invalidated/revoked when the client-side verification and thus publickey authentication method failed, granting access to soft-serve as the keypair identity's account but using the `keyboard-interactive` method to fulfill authentication.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Use an SSH keypair for a soft-serve account that requires client-side verification, such as passphrase, FIDO2 key types (ssh-sk), or GPG via gpg-agent with private key on smartcard like YubiKey. 2. For demo purposes of impact, create private repo in this keypair's account, and make account admin. 3. Ensure SSH will use the keypair created in step 1, e.g. ssh-agent, `ssh -i` etc. 4. Set `allow-keyless` server setting to true and verify SSH to soft-serve with no keys (kill ssh-agent and clear ~/.ssh/id\_\* files if needed) will allow anon-access, as a baseline. 5. SSH to soft-serve with the keypair (if needed, check `ssh -v` for "Server accepts key"), but intentionally fail client-side verification (e.g. disconnect YubiKey, enter wrong passphrase, etc). 6. soft-serve successfully grants access as keypair's account, and if step 2 is done, the test private repo(s) should be shown and, admin-only settings can be changed.   **Expected behavior** When client-side reports authentication failed, the keypair identity should be invalidated or revoked by the server, and access *as said user* should be denied.  **PoC Demo** <https://social.jjgadgets.tech/fileserver/01DQFBVR418A95WMKNYP0XFTVH/attachment/original/01MK1P51AZSVAWXXJ0Y8QB8BSQ.mp4>  **Environment (please complete the following information):** 2 devices were used:   1. ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 AMD, Void Linux, WezTerm, ssh-sk-ed25519 keys via ssh-agent and GPG ssh-ed25519 authn subkeys via gpg-agent, OpenSSH\_9.2p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1t 7 Feb 2023 2. Google Pixel 5, GrapheneOS, Termux, GPG ssh-ed25519 authn subkeys (stored on YubiKey) via OpenKeychain + okc-agent (gpg-agent compatible with OpenKeychain), OpenSSH\_9.1p1, OpenSSL 3.0.8 7 Feb 2023   **Additional context** This issue was first raised in the Discord server under a #help thread, so that the issue can be verified and confirmed by the devs in a relatively more private manner before it is publicised on this GitHub issue. |
