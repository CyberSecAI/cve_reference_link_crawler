**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266):** The vulnerability lies in how privileges are assigned during poll worker authentication, allowing access to sensitive cryptographic secrets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could gain access to sensitive election information.
*   An attacker could perform privileged actions on the voting system.
*   The vulnerability could potentially affect other election equipment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the ImageCast X device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to interact with the device as a poll worker.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate the authentication process in order to expose the cryptographic secrets.
