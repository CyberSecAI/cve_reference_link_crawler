{
  "CVE-2024-26874": {
    "description": "It's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip(). pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but in mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens. Instead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more efficient to just check if mtk_crtc->event is null before use.",
    "root_cause": "Race condition due to lack of proper locking when accessing mtk_crtc->event, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference can lead to a crash, causing a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability occurs within the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically within the MediaTek display driver. It could be triggered by activities that involve page flipping or display configuration changes on MediaTek based devices.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to trigger page flips or interact with the DRM subsystem on a vulnerable MediaTek device. This likely requires local access and possibly specific privileges."
