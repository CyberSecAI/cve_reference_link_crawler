The provided content is related to CVE-2023-40920.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of an SQL parameter within the `prixanconnect` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, sensitive SQL calls in the `PrixanconnectUpdateProductsModuleFrontController::importProducts()` method were vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This was due to unsanitized data within a JSON string posted in the body content being directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
- Obtain admin access
- Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
- Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™s ajax scripts
- Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or disrupt operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges are required.
- The attacker can be unauthenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted POST request with a malicious JSON payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
