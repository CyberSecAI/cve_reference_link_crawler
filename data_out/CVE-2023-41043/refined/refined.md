{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malicious agent could create a theme with a large number of theme components, each of which could contain a large icons-sprite upload, which are bundled and cached in each process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unbounded growth of the SvgSprite cache due to a large number of theme components with large icon-sprite uploads.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If the cache grows large enough, it would cause the unicorn processes to be killed, rendering the entire cluster inoperable (Denial of Service).",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to create a theme with many theme components. Low privileges required."
