Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `main.referenceURL` configuration setting in phpMyFAQ. The application was not properly validating that the provided URL was a valid URL, which allowed for the injection of non-URL data into the field which would later be used in contexts where a URL is expected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application failed to validate the `main.referenceURL` input as a proper URL. Specifically, it appears that it was treating any input as a valid URL which could be passed along further in the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The commit message "fix: only URLs should be allowed" strongly suggests that the injection of arbitrary data into this field could lead to various issues in parts of the application that consume the configuration value and expects a URL. The precise impact would depend on the context where the `main.referenceURL` is used. However, common impacts include:
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the URL is output in an HTML context without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript.
  - **Redirection:** The attacker could control where a user is redirected to.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** If an invalid URL or a very long URL is used, it could lead to the application to crash in contexts where the URL is used.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could modify the `main.referenceURL` configuration value via the admin panel or API with any non-URL value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need administrative access to the phpMyFAQ application to modify the `main.referenceURL` configuration setting.
