- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the handling of XML data provided to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DAP-1325 router.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint by sending crafted XML data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be in a network-adjacent position to the vulnerable device. Authentication is not required for exploitation.
