Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Social Feed plugin fails to properly validate and escape certain shortcode attributes before outputting them into the page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize the following attributes:
    - `fb_appid`
    - `locale`
    - `animate_effect`
    - `fanpage_url`
    - `box_width`
    - `box_height`
   
**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website which will then be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the page. This can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, steal session cookies, redirect to malicious sites, etc. Given the stored nature of this XSS the attack is persistent.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by the following shortcode attributes of the `efb_likebox` shortcode: `fb_appid`, `locale`, `animate_effect`, `fanpage_url`, `box_width`, and `box_height`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" role in the WordPress instance to be able to add/modify page content. This means the attacker needs to have an account with the capability to publish/edit posts.

The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.5.6.
