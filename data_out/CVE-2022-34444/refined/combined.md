| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2022-23089 | Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 9.0.0.x, 9.1.0.x, 9.2.0.x, 9.2.1.x, 9.3.0.x, and 9.4.0.x contain an Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability. An attacker with ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_SSH or ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_CONSOLE may potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to a Denial of Service situation. | 5.5 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |
| CVE-2022-23091 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.1.0.x through 9.4.0.x contains a use after free vulnerability. A low privilege local attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure, system takeover, or complete outage. | 6.7 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2022-33934 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.x through 9.4.x contain multiple stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. A remote authenticated malicious user with high privileges may potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code through multiple affected fields. | 7.7 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2022-34438 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.x through 9.4.0.x, contain a privilege context switching error. A local authenticated malicious user with high privilegesmay potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to full system compromise. This issue impacts compliance mode clusters. | 6.7 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2022-34439 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.0.x through 9.4.0.x contain allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability. A malicious unauthenticated network user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service and performance issue on that node. | 5.3 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L |
| CVE-2022-34444 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.2.0.x through 9.4.0.x contain an information vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause data leak. | 5.9 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE-2022-34445 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.x through 9.3.x contain a weak encoding for a password. A malicious local privileged attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure. | 6.0 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE-2022-34454 | Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.x-9.3.x contain a heap-based buffer overflow. A local privileged malicious user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to system takeover. This issue impacts compliance mode clusters. | 6.7 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |

**Note:** CVE-2022-34454 and CVE-2022-34438 scores 6.7 Medium, however in compliance mode cluster it is 6.7 (Business Critical) as it may affect compliance restrictions.
