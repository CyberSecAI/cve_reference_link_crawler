- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The driver `ddcdrv.sys` does not properly restrict access to its functionality, allowing low-privileged users to call the driver through `DeviceIoControl` and execute functions that allow for arbitrary physical memory mapping, and read/write access to I/O ports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of privilege checks on IOCTL handlers, specifically for operations involving physical memory mapping and I/O port access.
    - Exposure of primitives to read and write arbitrary I/O ports via IOCTL codes 0x222024, 0x222028 and 0x22202c.
    - Exposure of a primitive to map arbitrary physical memory via IOCTL code 0x222030.
    - Exposure of primitives to read arbitrary I/O ports via IOCTL codes 0x222018, 0x22201C and 0x222020.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users can use the driver's functionality to gain higher privileges.
    - Arbitrary code execution: Exploiting the vulnerability can lead to code execution under high privileges.
    - Information disclosure: Memory mapping can expose sensitive information.
    - Bypassing driver-signing policies: The signed vulnerable driver can be leveraged to deploy malicious unsigned code by circumventing the Microsoft driver-signing policy.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - IOCTL calls: By sending crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs the ability to interact with the driver via `DeviceIoControl`.
    - The attacker can be a low-privileged user on the target system.
