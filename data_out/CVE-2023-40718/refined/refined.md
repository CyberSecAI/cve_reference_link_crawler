- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An interpretation conflict within the FortiOS IPS engine when processing crafted TCP packets. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the IPS engine's failure to correctly handle custom TCP flags.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Interpretation conflict [CWE-436] leading to improper access control, and allowing for potential evasion of firewall policies and IPS protection.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can evade NGFW policies or IPS Engine protection, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious activities that the IPS engine is designed to block.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting special TCP packets with custom flags that cause the IPS engine to misinterpret the traffic.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic towards the vulnerable FortiOS device. The attacker doesn't need any authentication.
