Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-24017:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied parameters in the `/common/dict/list` endpoint. Specifically, the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into these parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches: Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Unauthorized access: Bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
    - Complete compromise of the application and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/common/dict/list` endpoint. The attacker would craft malicious SQL code within the `offset`, `limit`, or `sort` parameters of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/common/dict/list`. They do not need to be authenticated as this endpoint is commonly exposed to any user.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the application's SQL database structure to formulate effective SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable product is Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior versions.
- The identified fixed version is Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1, which seems to indicate a potential patch or fixed version with the same version number, which could be an indication that a fix has been introduced or that the vulnerability was misclassified.
