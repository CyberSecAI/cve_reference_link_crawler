The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47265.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The mlx5_ib driver was missing a validation check for the port value provided by the user when creating a flow rule. This missing check could lead to a kernel oops.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing input validation for the port value in the mlx5_ib driver.
- The lack of validation in the driver could allow an attacker to pass an invalid port value that would trigger a kernel oops.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A kernel oops will occur causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could provide an invalid port value when creating a flow rule using the ib_uverbs interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the ib_uverbs interface to create flow rules.
- The attacker would also need to have the ability to set the port value in the flow rule creation.
