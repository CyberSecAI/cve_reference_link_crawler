| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=25319#c0)  Nguyễn Đức Mạnh    2019-12-27 08:12:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 12151](attachment.cgi?id=12151 "PoC") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=12151&action=edit "PoC") PoC  Hello, There is a usage of uninitialized heap in opcodes/tic4x-dis.c:tic4x_print_cond()  ## Analysis Look at the initialization code of tic4x_conds: -------------------------------------------- /* Define conditional branch/load suffixes.  Put desired form for    disassembler last.  */ static const tic4x_cond_t tic4x_conds[] = {   { "u",    0x00 },   { "c",    0x01 }, { "lo",  0x01 },   { "ls",   0x02 },   { "hi",   0x03 },   { "nc",   0x04 }, { "hs",  0x04 },   { "z",    0x05 }, { "eq",  0x05 },   { "nz",   0x06 }, { "ne",  0x06 },   { "n",    0x07 }, { "l",   0x07 }, { "lt",  0x07 },   { "le",   0x08 },   { "p",    0x09 }, { "gt",  0x09 },   { "nn",   0x0a }, { "ge",  0x0a },   { "nv",   0x0c },   { "v",    0x0d },   { "nuf",  0x0e },   { "uf",   0x0f },   { "nlv",  0x10 },   { "lv",   0x11 },   { "nluf", 0x12 },   { "luf",  0x13 },   { "zuf",  0x14 },   /* Dummy entry, not included in num_conds.  This      lets code examine entry i+1 without checking      if we've run off the end of the table.  */   { "",      0x0} }; -------------------------------------------- Here you see the largest cond of a tic4x_cond is 0x14.  Look at the following code of opcodes/tic4x-dis.c:tic4x_print_cond(): -------------------------------------------- 272:  static int 273:  tic4x_print_cond (struct disassemble_info *info, unsigned int cond) 274:  { 275:    static tic4x_cond_t **condtable = NULL; 276:    unsigned int i; 277: 278:    if (condtable == NULL) 279:      { 280:        condtable = xmalloc (sizeof (tic4x_cond_t *) * 32); 281:        for (i = 0; i < tic4x_num_conds; i++) 282:  	condtable[tic4x_conds[i].cond] = (tic4x_cond_t *)(tic4x_conds + i); 283:      } 284:    if (cond > 31 || condtable[cond] == NULL) 285:      return 0; 286:    if (info != NULL) 287:      (*info->fprintf_func) (info->stream, "%s", condtable[cond]->name); 288:    return 1; 289:  } -------------------------------------------- At lines 280, condtable is malloced as an array of 32 elements. At line 382, condtable is intialized with condtable[tic4x_conds[i].cond] = (tic4x_cond_t *)(tic4x_conds + i). Because the largest tic4x_cond.cond is 0x14 = 20, so the element from offset 21 to 31 is not initialized. This can lead to information leak due to the print function at 287.  ## Reproduction --------------------PoC code---------------- #include "sysdep.h" #include "bfd.h" #include "dis-asm.h" #include "disassemble.h"  #include <stdint.h>  #define MAX_TEXT_SIZE 256 #define MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE 100 int gDebug = 0;
