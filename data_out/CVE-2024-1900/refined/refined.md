The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities in Devolutions Server. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-1900:

**CVE-2024-1900**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper session management in the identity provider authentication flow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The application fails to properly invalidate sessions after a user is disabled or deleted in the identity provider (Okta, Microsoft O365).
    *   The application relies on its own token expiration rather than checking with the identity provider upon each request
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could maintain access to the system even after their account has been disabled or deleted in the identity provider, until the Devolutions Server token expires.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Network
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user via an identity provider.
    *  The user account needs to have been disabled or deleted in the IDP, but the Devolutions token is still valid.

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Devolutions Server 2023.3.16 and earlier.
    *   Devolutions Server 2024.1.0 that were upgraded from an older Devolutions Server version.
*   **Fix:** New installations of Devolutions Server 2024.1.0 are not affected. For upgraded Devolutions Server 2024.1.0, the security dashboard will warn about using TokenID for authentication, requiring action from the administrator.
