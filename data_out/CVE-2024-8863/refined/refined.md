The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in aimhubio aim version 3.24 and earlier.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function in React is used within the `textbox.tsx` file. This function renders raw HTML, making it susceptible to XSS if user-supplied input isn't sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability due to the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the text input area which is then executed when other users view the content, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Defacement of the application.
    - Data theft.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious JavaScript within the input box that is processed by `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable text input field, often implying a user or other authenticated role within the application.
