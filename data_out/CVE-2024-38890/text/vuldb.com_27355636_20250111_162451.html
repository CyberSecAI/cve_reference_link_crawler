| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability was found in [Horizon Business Services Caterease up to 24.0.1.2405](?product.horizon_business_services:caterease) ([Hospitality Software](?type.hospitality_software)). It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is an unknown part. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a authentication replay vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-294](?vulnerability_cwe.273374 "Cwe"). A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes). Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CVE summarizes:
> An issue in Horizon Business Services Inc. Caterease Software 16.0.1.1663 through 24.0.1.2405 and possibly later versions allows a local attacker to perform an Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay attack due to insufficient protection against capture-replay attacks.

The bug was discovered 04/13/2024. The weakness was shared by Calvin Star (Skelet4r) with jTag Labs as security advisory (VulDB). The vendor cooperated in the coordination of the public release. Caterease is vulnerable to authentication bypass through a capture-replay attack.This vulnerability arises because the application relies on the UID for authentication without proper session validation. A local attacker can exploit this by capturing the authentication request sent by the client and modifying the UID within the request. By replaying the modified request, the attacker can impersonate any user whose UID is known or can be guessed, gaining unauthorized access to their account. This vulnerability is handled as [CVE-2024-38890](?source_cve.273374 "Cve") since 06/21/2024. The exploitation is known to be difficult. Local access is required to approach this attack. Technical details are unknown but a private exploit is available. This vulnerability is assigned to [T1040](?vulnerability_attck.273374 "Attck") by the MITRE ATT&CK project.

A private exploit has been developed by Skelet4r in Python. It is declared as proof-of-concept. The vulnerability was handled as a non-public zero-day exploit for at least 110 days. During that time the estimated underground price was around . Although an exploit is not currently publicly available, a proof-of-concept exploit has been developed by Skelet4r and jTag Labs to confirm the existence of this vulnerability within the Caterease application. This exploit was created for internal use only and is not being released publicly. To exploit this vulnerability, you need to proxy the traffic between the client application and the database server to intercept the authentication packet. Once intercepted, the authentication UID is modified, and the packet is replayed within the TCP stream to take over the targeted user account.

There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.
