The provided content includes a security bulletin from JetBrains which contains information about CVE-2021-31898.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the use of HTTP requests instead of HTTPS requests in WebStorm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is using insecure HTTP requests, which can expose sensitive data to eavesdropping or tampering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially intercept network traffic and gain access to sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where an attacker intercepts the unencrypted HTTP traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between WebStorm and the server it is communicating with. This could be a local network position or through a compromised network device.
