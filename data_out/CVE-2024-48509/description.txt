Learning with Texts (LWT) 2.0.3 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. This occurs when the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL statements into URL parameters. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, modify or delete data, and execute arbitrary commands.
