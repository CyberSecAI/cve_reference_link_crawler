The provided content discusses a path traversal vulnerability found in multiple Flask applications. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from using `flask.send_file` with untrusted user-controlled input. Specifically, the `filename` parameter is directly passed to `send_file` without proper sanitization.
- In some cases, the vulnerability also arises from the unsafe use of `os.path.join` with user-controlled input. The `os.path.join` function, when encountering an absolute path, ignores any preceding paths making it vulnerable to path traversal when combined with `flask.send_file`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use `../` sequences or absolute file paths to access files and directories outside the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including application source code, configuration files, and sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Partial Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially make multiple requests for large files, leading to a partial denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests, manipulating the filename parameter in the URL to include path traversal sequences.
- Specifically, an attacker can use `curl` to send a request such as `curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/download//../../../../etc/passwd'`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can typically be exploited without prior authentication or specific user privileges.

**Remediation:**
- **Sanitize Input:** Prevent user-controlled input from directly reaching `flask.send_file`.
- **Use `flask.safe_join`:**  Utilize `flask.safe_join` to validate and combine user-provided paths with a base path.
- **Use `flask.send_from_directory`:** Replace calls to `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory` , where the base directory is trusted and the filename is validated.
