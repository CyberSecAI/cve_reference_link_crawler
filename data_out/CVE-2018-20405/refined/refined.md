Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of restriction on parameters within POST requests. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code that is then evaluated within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to reveal the full path of the BigTree-CMS installation on the server.
*   **Unrestricted Parameter Handling:** The system does not sanitize or validate POST request parameters, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Code Evaluation:** Unrestricted parameters are directly evaluated within the application leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** An attacker can learn the full server path of the BigTree-CMS installation.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the primary issue is information disclosure, the underlying vulnerability (lack of input sanitization and code evaluation of POST parameters) suggests the potential for more serious attacks, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), if an attacker finds a way to execute arbitrary code in this context. However, the discussion in the issue suggests that developer-level access is required to fully leverage this code execution vector.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted POST requests with malicious parameters.
*   **Backstage Access Required:** The attacker needs to first log in to the BigTree-CMS administration interface (backstage) to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of the BigTree-CMS administrative interface (backstage). The initial report also states the need for "developer level access" to fully exploit the code execution aspects.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The assigned CVE was disputed as the identified behavior is considered normal for developer-level accounts, which have full write access to the filesystem, suggesting this might not be a vulnerability.
*   The github issue includes images demonstrating the output which disclose the file path of the BigTree-CMS installation.
*   The discussion suggests that while the vulnerability reveals information, its root cause is in unrestricted code evaluation which could have more serious consequences when combined with further attack vectors, but such a scenario might require a higher level of privilege.
