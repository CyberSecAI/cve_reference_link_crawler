| This looks like it requires developer level access which allows for full code execution through a variety of means (template creation, module creation, extension installation, etc). Am I missing the privilege escalation aspect? |

| Hi [@timbuckingham](https://github.com/timbuckingham) , Was this vulnerability ever addressed? note that there was a [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20405) assigned, if you wish, you can contact MITRE to dispute it if you disagree with it. Kind regards ! |

| No, this was not a vulnerability to be addressed as developer level accounts have full write access to the filesystem by design. |

| [@timbuckingham](https://github.com/timbuckingham) would you be contacting MITRE in order to dispute this ? Because as of now it appears as a valid/active vulnerability.  Thanks for your quick reply !  No, this was not a vulnerability to be addressed as developer level accounts have full write access to the filesystem by design. |

| I've submitted a rejection request at MITRE. I'm new at that process so hopefully I did it right! I'll follow up here when I hear back. |
