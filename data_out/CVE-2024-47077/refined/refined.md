Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-47077:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation during the token introspection process in the `/application/o/introspect/` endpoint. Specifically, the implementation validates the `client_id`, `client_secret` (of the proxy provider), and the `token` separately, without ensuring that the token corresponds to the same provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Cross-Provider Token Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper linkage between the provided token and the OAuth2 provider it was issued by.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Token Stealing and Impersonation:** An attacker can steal an access token issued to one application and use it to impersonate the user against any other proxy provider.
- **Unauthorized Access:** A user can potentially use an access token they were legitimately issued for one application to access another application they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can obtain a valid access token from one application.
- The attacker then presents the stolen access token to a different proxy provider's `/application/o/introspect/` endpoint, along with valid `client_id` and `client_secret` for the target proxy provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid access token from any application managed by the vulnerable authentik instance.
- The attacker needs to know the client ID and secret of the target proxy provider.
- The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests to the `/application/o/introspect/` endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in authentik versions <= 2024.6.4 and <= 2024.8.2 and is fixed in versions 2024.6.5 and 2024.8.3.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
- The vulnerability was reported by @quentinmit.

The provided patch modifies the introspection logic to ensure that the access or refresh token is associated with the authenticating provider.
