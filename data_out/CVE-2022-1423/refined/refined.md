{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GitLab CI/CD caching mechanism does not properly isolate caches between protected and unprotected branches.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient isolation of CI/CD cache",
       "Lack of privilege separation in cache management"
    ],
    "impact": "A user with the ability to create pipelines on an unprotected branch can poison the cache used by a protected branch, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the protected branch's pipeline. This can result in sensitive information leakage, build process alteration, and backdooring of the final product.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user creates a pipeline on an unprotected branch with a modified cache entry (e.g. by overwriting a cached file with malicious code) using a predictable cache key. When a pipeline on a protected branch runs and reuses the poisoned cache, the malicious code will be executed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to push code and trigger a pipeline on an unprotected branch. This usually requires 'developer' permissions or any permissions allowing to run a pipeline."
  },
    "content_summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in GitLab's CI/CD caching mechanism (CVE-2022-1423), where the cache is not isolated between protected and unprotected branches. This allows a user with developer or similar permissions to poison the cache of a protected branch by running a pipeline on an unprotected branch. This enables arbitrary code execution on protected branches."
