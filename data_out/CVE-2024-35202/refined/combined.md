# [Disclosure of CVE-2024-35202](/en/2024/10/08/disclose-blocktxn-crash/ "Disclosure of CVE-2024-35202")

by .

Before Bitcoin Core v25.0, an attacker could remotely crash Bitcoin Core
nodes by triggering an assertion in the blocktxn message handling logic.

This issue is considered **High** severity.

## Details

When receiving a block announcement via a cmpctblock message, Bitcoin Core
attempts to reconstruct the announced block using the transactions in its own
mempool as well as other available transactions. If reconstruction fails due to
missing transactions it will request them from the announcing peer via a
getblocktxn message. In response a blocktxn message is expected, which should
contain the requested transactions.

The compact block protocol employs shortened transaction identifiers to reduce
bandwidth. These short-ids are 6 byte in size, resulting in a small chance for
collisions (i.e. transaction A has the same short-id as transaction B) upon
block reconstruction. Collisions will be detected as the merkle root computed
from the reconstructed set of transactions will not match the merkle root from
the block announcement. Peers should not be punished for collisions as they may
happen spuriously, therefore they are handled by falling back to requesting the
full block.

Bitcoin Core will create an instance of `PartiallyDownloadedBlock`
whenever a new compact block is received. If missing transactions are
requested, the instance is persisted until the corresponding blocktxn message
is processed. Upon receiving the blocktxn message,
`PartiallyDownloadedBlock::FillBlock` is called, attempting to
reconstruct the full block. In the collision case described above, the full
block is requested but the `PartiallyDownloadedBlock` instance as
well as the other state related to the underlying block request is left
untouched. This leaves room for a second blocktxn message for the same block to
be processed and trigger `FillBlock` to be called again. This
violates the assumption (documented as an `assert` statement) that
`FillBlock` can only be called once and causes the node to crash.

An attacker does not need to get lucky by triggering a collision, as the
collision handling logic can easily be triggered by simply including
transactions in the blocktxn message that are not committed to in the blockâs
merkle root.

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.4 | 0.3.5 |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One exploited a bug in the transaction handling code and allowed an attacker to spend coins that they did not own. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

```
Date: 2010-09-29
Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

## CVE-2012-2459

Date: 2012-05-14
Summary: Block hash collision (via merkle tree)
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitcoin-Qtbitcoind | \* - 0.4.6rc10.5.0rc1 - 0.5.5rc10.6.0rc1 - 0.6.0.7rc10.6.1rc1 - 0.6.1rc1 | 0.4.60.5.50.6.0.70.6.1rc2 |

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.
