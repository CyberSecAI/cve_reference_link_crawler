Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `fbcon_do_set_font` function within the Linux kernel's framebuffer console (fbcon) driver.  Specifically, when setting a new font, the code was designed to restore the old font data only when the new font was a "user" font. If the `vc_resize` function failed during the font setting process, and the original font was an internal "system" font, then the old font data was not restored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Conditional Font Data Restoration:** The primary vulnerability is the conditional restoration of font data. The code incorrectly assumed that only user-defined fonts needed to be restored upon failure of `vc_resize()`. This left the kernel in a state where the system font data could be corrupted/lost without being restored if `vc_resize` fails for any reason.
- **Missing Failure Handling:** The initial implementation failed to account for cases where `vc_resize()` might fail when dealing with internal fonts, leaving the system in an inconsistent state with a missing font.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to a page fault when `font_get()` is called after the font data has been lost/corrupted. The system becomes unusable and requires a reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Font Setting:** The vulnerability can be triggered by attempting to set a new font using the `fbcon_do_set_font` function and forcing a failure of `vc_resize()` which can be achieved by various methods including fault injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Trigger Font Setting:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the font setting mechanism which is exposed via `ioctl` operations on tty devices.
- **Ability to Cause `vc_resize` Failure:** The attacker needs to be able to somehow trigger a failure of the `vc_resize()` function during the font setting process. This might be achieved by manipulating resource allocation or using fault injection techniques.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

The provided content gives significantly more detail than a typical CVE description:
- It identifies the specific function `fbcon_do_set_font` where the vulnerability exists.
- It clarifies that the issue is due to a conditional restore of font data only for user fonts, and not for system fonts.
- It provides a detailed crash report including stack traces and registers.
- It mentions that the vulnerability can be triggered via a `vc_resize()` allocation failure during the first font setting, and the use of fault injection to facilitate this.
- It explicitly notes the Syzkaller test case used to identify the issue and the test user `Sirius` who reported it.
- It provides the fix that changes the logic to ensure the font data is restored in all cases, regardless if its a user or internal font.
