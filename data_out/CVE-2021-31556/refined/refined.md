Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31556:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in `MWOAuthConsumerSubmitControl.php`. This file does not validate that the length of a generated RSA key will fit into the MySQL blob field used to store it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The code fails to check if the size of an RSA key will exceed the maximum length for a MySQL blob field.
- Data truncation: When an RSA key is too large, it is truncated when saved into the database, resulting in an incomplete or unusable key.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data integrity loss: The vulnerability could lead to an incomplete RSA key being stored, causing authentication or authorization issues with the MediaWiki application.
- Application failure:  The truncation could result in a non-functional consumer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input: An attacker could exploit this by providing an RSA key that is too large for the field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to a vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
- Ability to influence the creation of MWOAuth consumers with RSA keys.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes references to bugzilla entries which provide more details about this CVE and how it was fixed in MediaWiki.
- The issue was addressed in MediaWiki version 1.35.4 and 1.36.2.
- This vulnerability is related to a data storage limitation within the MySQL database.
