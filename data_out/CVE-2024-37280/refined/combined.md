**Elasticsearch StackOverflow vulnerability (ESA-2024-14)**

A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.

**Affected Versions:**

Elasticsearch version 8.13.1 through 8.13.4.

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

The issue is resolved in Elasticsearch 8.14.0.

**Severity:** CVSSv3: 4.9(Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-37280
