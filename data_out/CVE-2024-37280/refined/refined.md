Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-37280:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A StackOverflow exception occurs during document ingestion in Elasticsearch when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of "passthrough" type, an experimental feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The "passthrough" field mapping type within Elasticsearch index templates leads to a StackOverflow exception upon document ingestion, under certain circumstances.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to the StackOverflow exception.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs during document ingestion. An attacker would need to create an index template with a vulnerable dynamic field mapping configuration and then ingest data to trigger the StackOverflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create an index template containing a dynamic field mapping of the "passthrough" type, and ingest data into an index using that template. The NetApp advisory indicates "High" privileges are needed to exploit.
- The vulnerability is present in Elasticsearch versions 8.13.1 through 8.13.4.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is resolved in Elasticsearch 8.14.0.
- The NetApp advisory confirms that multiple NetApp products incorporate Elasticsearch, and versions 8.13.1 through 8.13.4 are susceptible to this vulnerability.
- NetApp is still investigating which products are affected and no patches are available as of the time of the advisory.
- NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
