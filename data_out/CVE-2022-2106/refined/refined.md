Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient validation of filenames within the software. This lack of validation allows for relative path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate filenames, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.
- The impact is rated as having a low impact on confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely.
- The attack complexity is low.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges.
- No user interaction is required.
