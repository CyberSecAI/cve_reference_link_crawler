Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-36314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied data within the "Notifications" feature of the Callback Widget. Specifically, the `value-text-o_email_request_message`, `value-text-o_sms_request_message`, `value-text-o_admin_email_request_message`, and `value-text-o_sms_email_request_message` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the notifications settings page that will be executed in the victim's browser when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the "Notifications" page of the Callback Widget. The attacker would need to modify one of the vulnerable parameters with the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Callback Widget Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the administration panel of the Callback Widget to modify notification settings.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs to use a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP POST request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker crafts a payload like `"%3C%2Ftextarea%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E%3Ctextarea%3E"` and injects it into vulnerable parameters.
*   The vulnerable parameters are related to notification messages: `value-text-o_email_request_message`, `value-text-o_sms_request_message`, `value-text-o_admin_email_request_message` or `value-text-o_sms_email_request_message`.
*   The injected script executes when the notification settings page is rendered.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerable parameters, the payload required for exploitation, and the required attacker capabilities.
