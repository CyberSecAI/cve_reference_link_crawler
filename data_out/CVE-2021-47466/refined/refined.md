Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2021-47466**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak could occur in the `kmem_cache_open()` function within the Linux kernel's SLUB memory allocator when an error occurs during cache creation. Specifically, the `random_seq` field of the SLUB cache was not being properly released in the error path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `random_seq` resource was not freed when `alloc_kmem_cache_cpus` failed in `kmem_cache_open`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering the error path in `kmem_cache_open()` could lead to a gradual memory leak. This could eventually cause system instability due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an error condition during kmem_cache creation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger the allocation of a kmem_cache in a way that leads to `alloc_kmem_cache_cpus` failing to trigger the vulnerable code path.

The provided patches correct this vulnerability by ensuring that `__kmem_cache_release()` is called in the error path, which releases all allocated resources, including `random_seq`.
