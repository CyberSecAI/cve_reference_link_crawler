{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an authorization bypass in the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` script allows an attacker to obtain the router's apmib configuration file without requiring any authentication or authorization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain the `apmib` configuration file, which contains sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, which can then be decoded for use by the attacker.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a request to the `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` endpoint to obtain the configuration file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable router to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
