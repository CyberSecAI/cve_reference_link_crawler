**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the HTTPD daemon. This occurs when the daemon processes a malformed PUT request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: A buffer on the stack is overflowed due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a PUT request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Service Crash: A successful exploit can cause the HTTPD service to crash.
- Improper access control: Although code execution is not confirmed, a successful attack leads to a denial of service and potentially allows for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
