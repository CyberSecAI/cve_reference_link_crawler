Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-4036:

**CVE-2022-4036: Appointment Hour Booking <= 1.3.72 â€“ CAPTCHA Bypass**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin uses an insufficiently strong hashing algorithm for the CAPTCHA secret, which is also exposed to the user via a cookie. This allows attackers to predict valid CAPTCHA values.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Weak CAPTCHA implementation, insecure handling of CAPTCHA secret.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can bypass CAPTCHA protection, potentially leading to automated submission of booking forms, spam, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation occurs through automated requests to booking forms, bypassing CAPTCHA verification. The cookie with the weak hash is used to predict CAPTCHA values and bypass verification.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs no specific capabilities beyond being able to send HTTP requests and having access to the cookie. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
