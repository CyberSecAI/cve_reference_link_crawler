The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35797.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from two race conditions in the `filemap_cachestat` function when dealing with shared memory (shmem) and swap operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Poisoned Swap Entry:** A swap-in error can lead to a "poisoned" swap entry within the shmem inode's xarray. This can result in an out-of-bounds access when `get_shadow_from_swap_cache()` is called, because it directly accesses the `swapper_spaces[]` array using the swap entry as an index without proper validation.
2. **Missing Shadow Entry:** When a valid swap entry is found in the shmem's inode, the corresponding shadow entry in the swap cache might not exist. This can occur if swap I/O is still in progress, or the shadow has been removed due to a swap-in, invalidation, or swapoff operation that occurred after the shmem swap entry was observed. This can lead to a NULL pointer being passed to `workingset_test_recent()`, resulting in a potentially bogus test and a false "recently evicted" count.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Out-of-bounds access:** The first vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access when `get_shadow_from_swap_cache()` attempts to access `swapper_spaces[]` using a poisoned swap entry.
2. **Incorrect cache statistics:** The second vulnerability could potentially lead to inaccurate cache statistics being reported by the `cachestat` syscall, resulting in a false "recently evicted" count. This might not cause immediate system instability but will produce incorrect metrics.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are triggered through the `cachestat` syscall, which is part of the memory management subsystem and is used to query information about page cache eviction. The race condition exists when `filemap_cachestat` is processing swap entries for shared memory pages while swap operations (swapin, swapoff) or invalidation are occurring concurrently.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger the `cachestat` syscall and also cause swapping or invalidation operations to interact with the same shared memory concurrently to exploit the race conditions. Specifically, they need to create shared memory regions, fill them with data so they are swapped out, and then call the cachestat system call.
