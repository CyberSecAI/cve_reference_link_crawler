| Is it obvious what the impact of this is? Are there any attackers utilising this in the wild? I understand it is probably not a great design choice and the validation should have been stronger, but it would be great to get an idea of exposure |

| [@hueypeard](https://github.com/hueypeard) Seconding what [@sreetamdas](https://github.com/sreetamdas) mentioned. We wrote up an [FAQ](https://blog.sentry.io/next-js-sdk-security-advisory-cve-2023-46729/#faqs) with everything we could think of that might be relevant to the vulnerability. If you're still missing information, let us know how we can improve it! |
