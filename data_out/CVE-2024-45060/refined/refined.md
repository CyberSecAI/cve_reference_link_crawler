The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php` sample script. The script concatenates user-provided parameters directly into spreadsheet formulas without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Formula injection is possible due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page by manipulating the spreadsheet formulas.
- This can lead to various attacks, including but not limited to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack, performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with malicious input values for parameters A, B and C when accessing `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php` script through a web browser.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.
- User interaction is required to submit the malicious input via the form on the page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the sample file `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php`.
- Affected versions:
    - >= 2.2.0, < 2.3.0
    - < 1.29.2
    - >= 2.0.0, < 2.1.1
- Patched versions:
    - 2.3.0
    - 1.29.2
    - 2.1.1
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject JavaScript code by manipulating the 'a' parameter.
- The suggested remediation is to ensure that the parameters are forced to be numerical values using `floatval()` function.
