Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within the GlobalProtect Gateway in PAN-OS software, specifically related to the handling of user sessions in the SSL VPN component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The system fails to properly manage user privileges, allowing an authenticated user to act as another user.
- **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The system fails to correctly authorize user actions, leading to the ability to impersonate other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can impersonate another user.
- The attacker can send network packets to internal assets, potentially accessing sensitive resources.
- The attacker cannot receive response packets from those internal assets. This limits the scope of the impact but still enables malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Requires an attacker to have valid credentials to authenticate on the GlobalProtect portal

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GlobalProtect portal.
- No special privileges are required beyond having a valid user account.
- The vulnerability is applicable if SSL VPN is enabled (either as fallback or as the only available tunnel mode)
