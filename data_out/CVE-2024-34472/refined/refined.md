- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ordemGrid` parameter in a POST request to `/mailinspector/mliRealtimeEmails.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to the disclosure of the entire application database.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can send a crafted POST request to `/mailinspector/mliRealtimeEmails.php` with a malicious SQL payload within the `ordemGrid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
