  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-39917",
      "root_cause": "The `MaxLoginRetry` parameter in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini` is not effectively enforced, allowing an unlimited number of login attempts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The mechanism to limit login attempts using `MaxLoginRetry` is not functioning as intended."
      ],
       "impact": "Attackers can make an infinite number of login attempts, potentially leading to brute-force attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "No specific privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker only needs network access to the xrdp service."

    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-39917",
       "root_cause": "When the `require_credentials` option is set to true, the server does not handle the case when the credentials are invalid, causing the connection to terminate without displaying a login screen.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Logic error in handling of `require_credentials` option, leading to immediate connection termination upon invalid credentials without displaying the login screen"
       ],

          "Network-based attacks"
        ],
      "required_capabilities":"An attacker must have network access to the xrdp service, and knowledge of the username/password requirements if require_credentials is set."
