{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` script in Wavlink WN579X3 devices does not enforce proper authorization, allowing unauthenticated access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Sensitive information exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can download the device's configuration file, which contains sensitive information including the administrator password. Although the data is encrypted, decryption information is publicly available, allowing for full compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted POST request to `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` via HTTP. No authentication is required.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device on the local network (or via a publicly exposed IP)."
