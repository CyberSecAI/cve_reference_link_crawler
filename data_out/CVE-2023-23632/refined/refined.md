- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect validation of a randomly generated secret used for authentication when establishing shell jump sessions using external tools. The system only checks if the provided characters of the secret are in the correct position, but not the length, accepting a connection if just the first character of the secret is correct.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Flawed authentication logic. The system does not properly verify the entire secret, making it vulnerable to a bypass. Lack of brute-force protection allows attackers to quickly guess the first character.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to a jump item (network device, server, etc.), leading to a complete compromise of the target system. This can result in full control of the targeted system, including data and operational disruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to be on the same host as the vulnerable BeyondTrust Access Console Client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user or process on the same host where the vulnerable application is running. They also need the ability to enable external tools for shell jump sessions within the Access Console Client and access the SSH connection string that includes the secret. They also need to execute external tools like SSH to connect.
