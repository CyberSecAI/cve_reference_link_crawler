{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in Process Explorer. Specifically, Process Explorer does not adequately handle process names exceeding 255 characters when combined with the PID, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) against all Process Explorer users (including admins), rendering the tool unusable by creating a process with a name that exceeds 255 characters before the PID is added. This effectively prevents administrators from using Process Explorer to manage the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted process name",
        "The attacker must be able to create a process with a specific name"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a process with a specially crafted name that is 255 characters long and does not have a file extension. This can be achieved by an unprivileged user. The attacker doesn't need any admin privileges."
  }
