```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of the signature counter value. The webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly persist the counter value when an authenticator returns an incremented signature counter during authentication. This causes cloned authenticator detection to fail.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper signature counter value handling that leads to cloned authenticator detection failure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use a cloned authenticator without being detected by the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker clones a valid authenticator and uses the clone to authenticate.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have cloned a valid authenticator somehow. No specific position within the system is noted."
