"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 and RV345 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n"
