These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.
