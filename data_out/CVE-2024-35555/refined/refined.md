The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in idccms V1.35.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability is present in `share_switch.php` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially modify data, change configurations, or perform actions within the application without the user's knowledge or consent. Specifically, the provided PoC suggests that the state of a news web item can be toggled.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or email containing a crafted HTML form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint. The victim's browser will send the request along with any existing session cookies, leading to successful exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page that will be opened by a logged-in user of the idccms application. The attacker doesn't require direct access to the victim's session or the application itself, just the ability to serve malicious HTML.
