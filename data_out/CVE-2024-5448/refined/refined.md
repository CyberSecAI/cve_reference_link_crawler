- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the page. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and data theft.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a crafted shortcode with malicious script in an attribute value into a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in WordPress to create or edit posts/pages.
