- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. When an administrator views the affected settings page, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, and able to access the "WP Staging > Backup & Migration" page. The attacker modifies the "Backup Name" field with malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges or equivalent high-privilege access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
