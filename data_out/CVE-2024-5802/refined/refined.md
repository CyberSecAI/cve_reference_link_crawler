- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Anchor Text" input field in the advanced settings for URL shortener creation is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the shortlinks page, leading to potential compromise of user accounts or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have admin privileges and can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Anchor Text" field while creating or editing a URL shortener within the plugin's admin settings page. When the shortlink is viewed, the injected script is executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site.
