CVE ID         : CVE-2023-22655 CVE-2023-28746 CVE-2023-38575 CVE-2023-39368
                 CVE-2023-43490
Debian Bug     : 1066108

Intel has released microcode updates, addressing serveral vulnerabilties.

CVE-2023-22655

    Protection mechanism failure in some 3rd and 4th Generation Intel(R)
    Xeon(R) Processors when using Intel(R) SGX or Intel(R) TDX may allow
    a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via
    local access.

CVE-2023-28746

    Information exposure through microarchitectural state after
    transient execution from some register files for some Intel(R)
    Atom(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially
    enable information disclosure via local access.

CVE-2023-38575

    Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts
    in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to
    potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVE-2023-39368

    Protection mechanism failure of bus lock regulator for some Intel(R)
    Processors may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable
    denial of service via network access.

CVE-2023-43490

    Incorrect calculation in microcode keying mechanism for some
    Intel(R) Xeon(R) D Processors with Intel(R) SGX may allow a
    privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via
    local access.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.20240312.1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.

### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some Intel¬Æ Processors may allow information disclosure. Intel is releasing a firmware update to mitigate this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID:[CVE-2023-38575](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38575)

Description: Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel¬Æ Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 5.5 Medium

CVSS Vector:[CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

A list of impacted products can be found¬†[here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html).

### Recommendation:

Intel recommends that users of affected Intel¬Æ Processors¬†update to the latest version firmware provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.

Intel has released microcode updates for the affected Intel¬Æ Processors that are currently supported on the public github repository. Please see details below on access to the microcode:

GitHub\*: Public Github:¬†<https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files>

For non Intel¬Æ Software Guard Extension (SGX) customers the microcode patch can be OS loadable.

For the mitigation to be effective for Intel¬Æ SGX enabled systems, Intel recommends updating the microcode located in platform flash designated by firmware interface table (FIT) entry point1.

Detailed steps on the microcode loading points can be found at:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/secure-coding/loading-microcode-os.html>

End users and systems administrators should check with their system manufacturers and system software vendors and apply any available updates as soon as practical.

To address this vulnerability, a SGX TCB recovery is planned, refer¬†[here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/resources/q1-2024-intel-tcb-recovery-guidance.html)¬†for more information on the SGX TCB recovery process.

Attestation responses will change as a result of the TCB Recovery. Refer to the¬†[Intel SGX Attestation Technical Details](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/technical-details/sgx-attestation-technical-details.html)¬†documentation for further details.

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Intel employees for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
