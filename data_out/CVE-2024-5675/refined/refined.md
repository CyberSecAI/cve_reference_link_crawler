Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the insecure deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to code injection via a malicious payload injected into the "ViewState" field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe Deserialization: The application deserializes data from the "ViewState" field without proper validation or sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- CWE-502: This vulnerability is classified as CWE-502, which refers to "Deserialization of Untrusted Data."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is network-accessible (CVSS AV:N).
- Injection through "ViewState" Field: The attacker injects a malicious payload into the "ViewState" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No privileges required: No authentication or user interaction is necessary to exploit this vulnerability (CVSS PR:N/UI:N).
- Low Attack Complexity: The attack requires low complexity (CVSS AC:L).
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application with the malicious payload in the "ViewState" parameter.

**Affected Product:**
- Mentor â€“ Employee Portal, version 3.83.35.

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability has been fixed in Mentor - Employee Portal, version 3.87.7.
