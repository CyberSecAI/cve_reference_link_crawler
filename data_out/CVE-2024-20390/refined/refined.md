- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error validation of ingress XML packets in the Dedicated XML Agent feature of Cisco IOS XR Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation of XML packets. Specifically, a lack of proper error validation of ingress XML packets received by the Dedicated XML Agent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the XML TCP port 38751 to become unreachable, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a sustained, crafted stream of XML traffic to the target device on the XML TCP listen port 38751.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device's XML TCP port (38751). No authentication is required.
