This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error validation of ingress XML packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained, crafted stream of XML traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause XML TCP port 38751 to become unreachable while the attack traffic persists.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-xml-tcpdos-ZEXvrU2S>  This advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IOS XR Software if it had Dedicated XML Agent enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine Whether Dedicated XML Agent Is Configured To determine whether Dedicated XML Agent is configured on a device, use the **show running-config “| include xml”** command. If the command returns **xml agent**,1 the device is considered vulnerable, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router# show running-config | xmlxml agent   ```  1. The **xml agent tty** configuration command is a different service and does not indicate that the device is affected. If only the **xml agent tty** configuration command is present in the running configuration, the device is not affected. An affected device will return only the **xml agent** command. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, if the Dedicated XML Agent feature is not needed and is disabled in the configuration, the device is not affected.  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases In the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases or trains. The right column indicates whether a release (train) is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.       | Cisco IOS XR Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 7.11 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 24.1 | 24.1.2 |       At the time of publication, Cisco had released the following SMUs to address this vulnerability. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information, including SMU availability. Customers who require SMUs for platforms or releases that are not listed are advised to contact their support organization.       | Cisco IOS XR Software Release | Platform | SMU Name |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 7.11.2 | IOSXRWBDNCS5500 | iosxrwbd-7.11.2.CSCwj39201ncs5500-7.11.2.CSCwj39201 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
