Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control on the `/currentsetting.htm` page of the Netgear R6850 router's web management interface. This hidden interface exposes sensitive information without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information, such as firmware version, region, model, internet connection status, parental control support, SOAP version, Readyshare support level, XCloud support, Login method, blank state information, and SOAP HTTPS port.
- **Missing Authentication:** The lack of authentication requirements for accessing the `/currentsetting.htm` page is a critical security flaw that enables unauthorized access to the sensitive information.
- **Hidden Interface:** The fact that the vulnerable interface is hidden suggests a lack of comprehensive security assessment during the development process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the router and its configuration.
- **Reputational Damage:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a loss of customer trust and damage to the Netgear's reputation.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The leaked information could be used as a reconnaissance step for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router to access its web management interface and the exposed `/currentsetting.htm` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Netgear R6850 router.
- No specific technical skills are needed other than being able to visit a URL via a web browser.
