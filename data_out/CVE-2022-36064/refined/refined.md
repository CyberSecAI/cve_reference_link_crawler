Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inefficient regular expressions used in the `shescape` library when escaping arguments for Unix shells (Bash and Dash) with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Specifically, two regular expressions are susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Polynomial backtracking:** One of the regular expressions used for escaping is vulnerable to polynomial backtracking, where specific input strings can cause the regex engine to take an excessive amount of time to process, leading to performance issues.
- **Quadratic runtime:** Another regular expression can exhibit quadratic runtime complexity, meaning the processing time grows quadratically with the input string length, causing the program to slow down significantly or even become unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service by providing specially crafted input strings to the `shescape.escape` or `shescape.escapeAll` functions. This will cause the program to be slow or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific input strings, for example, using repeated characters such as `{`, `:`, or `,`, combined with other characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input strings that are passed to the `shescape.escape` or `shescape.escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true` and targeted towards Bash or Dash shells or any not-officially-supported shell.
- No specific position is required, but the attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable input to the shescape library functions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Bash and Dash shells or any not-officially-supported shell, and when using the `escape` or `escapeAll` function with the `interpolation` option set to `true`.
- The issue was resolved by modifying the regular expressions to avoid polynomial backtracking and quadratic runtime.
- The vulnerability was patched in versions 1.5.10 (and 1.5.9 for Dash only) of `shescape`.
- As a workaround, users can enforce maximum length on the input strings, but detecting vulnerable strings is not recommended since it could introduce additional vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-1333 (Regular Expression Denial of Service).
