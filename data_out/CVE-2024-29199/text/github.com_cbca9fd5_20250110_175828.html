# Closes [GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4 "GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4")

# What's Changed

## Security fixes

* The endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/` now requires user authentication to access, and also enforces appropriate JobResult `view` permissions now.
* The endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/` now requires user authentication to access.
* Removed the URL endpoints `/api/users/users/my-profile/`, `/api/users/users/session/`, `/api/users/tokens/authenticate/`, and `/api/users/tokens/logout/` as they are unused at this time.
* The `/api/graphql/` REST API endpoint now requires user authentication to execute GraphQL queries, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured.
* The `nautobot.apps.api.APIRootView` class now enforces user authentication by default. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication.
* The endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/` now require user authentication, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured.

## Additional permissions enforcement

* The `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint now requires the requesting user to have `view` permission on the specified `peer_interface`.
* The endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/dry-run/` have corrected permissions now - a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions.
* Viewing Notes associated to a given model now requires `extras.view_note` permissions for each note to display (this is consistent with how change log views for a model enforce `extras.view_objectchange` permissions).

## Bug fixes, housekeeping, documentation

* Fixed a 500 error when accessing any of the `/dcim/<port-type>/<uuid>/connect/<termination_b_type>/` view endpoints with an invalid/nonexistent `termination_b_type` string.
* The `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter` class now accepts a `view_name` and/or `view_description` as parameters. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs.
* Updated example views in the App developer documentation to include `ObjectPermissionRequiredMixin` or `LoginRequiredMixin` as appropriate best practices.
* Updated custom views in the `example_plugin` to include `LoginRequiredMixin` as a best practice.
* Added integration test case that enumerates all registered URL patterns and verifies that they return appropriate response codes when accessed by an unauthenticated user.

# Screenshots

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Example Plugin Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design

Sorry, something went wrong.

Yeah 😢 This one scope crept, but I think everything in it is still relevant/necessary.

Should this be `get_valid_url_for_url_pattern` or `get_fake_url_for_url_pattern` maybe?

This would be a good test to expose to apps. Not blocking but should we write a generic test for this?

I do plan/want to add a generic test to the cookiecutter that takes in the app's urlconf and iterates/validates its url patterns, yeah. I like the idea of implementing the bulk of it in core rather than in the cookiecutter but that'll take some thinking about how to do it.

Is there a reason this is not:

```
if getattr(view, "name", None) is not None:
    return view.name
```

OR

```
name = getattr(view, "name", None)
if name is not None:
    return name
```

Just looks weird to me as written?
