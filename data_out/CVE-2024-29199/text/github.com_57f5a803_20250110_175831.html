## What's Changed

### Security

* [#5450](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5450) - Updated `django` to `~3.2.25` due to `CVE-2024-27351`.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`; furthermore it will not allow an authenticated user to view log entries for a JobResult they don't otherwise have permission to view. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/dry-run/`; a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint; a user who has `view` permissions for a subset of interfaces is no longer permitted to query other interfaces for which they lack permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on all `<app>/<model>/<uuid>/notes/` UI endpoints; a user must now have the appropriate `extras.view_note` permissions to view existing notes. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the REST API endpoints `/api/redoc/`, `/api/swagger/`, `/api/swagger.json`, and `/api/swagger.yaml`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the `/api/graphql` REST API endpoint, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))

### Added

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_for_url_pattern` and `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_patterns` lookup functions.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added `nautobot.apps.views.GenericView` base class.

### Changed

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added support for `view_name` and `view_description` optional parameters when instantiating a `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter`. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication by default on the `nautobot.apps.api.APIRootView` class. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication.

### Removed

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Removed the URL endpoints `/api/users/users/my-profile/`, `/api/users/users/session/`, `/api/users/tokens/authenticate/`, and `/api/users/tokens/logout/` as they are unused at this time.

### Fixed

* [#5413](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5413) - Updated Device "LLDP Neighbors" detail panel to handle LLDP neighbors with MAC address as port-id.
* [#5423](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5423) - Fixed collapsable navbar for GraphiQL page `/graphql`.
* [#5423](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5423) - Fixed collapsable navbar for Admin page `/admin`.
* [#5423](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5423) - Fixed collapsable navbar for Django Rest Framework (DRF) page `/api/`.
* [#5423](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5423) - Improved footer responsiveness for certain media sizes.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Fixed a 500 error when accessing any of the `/dcim/<port-type>/<uuid>/connect/<termination_b_type>/` view endpoints with an invalid/nonexistent `termination_b_type` string.
* [#5466](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5466) - Remove duplicated location param in vlan table.

### Dependencies

* [#5296](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5296) - Fixed bug in pyproject.toml that added `coverage` as a nautobot dependency instead of a development dependency.

### Documentation

* [#5340](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5340) - Added installation documentation about recommended health-checks for Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Updated example views in the App developer documentation to include `ObjectPermissionRequiredMixin` or `LoginRequiredMixin` as appropriate best practices.

### Housekeeping

* [#1746](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1746) - Replaced `OrderedDict` instance in `nautobot/core/api/routers.py#21` with with a plain `dict` instance.
* [#1746](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/1746) - Replaced `OrderedDict` instance in `nautobot/dcim/models/racks.py#275` with a plain `dict` instance.
* [#5435](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5435) - Added `--pattern` argument to `invoke unittest`.
* [#5435](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5435) - Added `--parallel-workers` argument to `invoke unittest`.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Updated custom views in the `example_plugin` to use the new `GenericView` base class as a best practice.
