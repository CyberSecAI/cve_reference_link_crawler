|  |  | Added support for `view\_name` and `view\_description` optional parameters when instantiating a `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter`. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs. |
|  |  | Added requirement for user authentication by default on the `nautobot.core.api.AuthenticatedAPIRootView` class. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication. |
|  |  | Added requirement for user authentication to access `/api/docs/` and `/graphql/` even when `HIDE\_RESTRICTED\_UI` is False. |

## What's Changed

### Security

* [#5450](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5450) - Updated `django` to `~3.2.25` due to `CVE-2024-27351`.
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`; furthermore it will not allow an authenticated user to view log entries for a JobResult they don't otherwise have permission to view. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<str:slug>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<str:slug>/dry-run/`; a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint; a user who has `view` permissions for a subset of interfaces is no longer permitted to query other interfaces for which they lack permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on all `<app>/<model>/<lookup>/notes/` UI endpoints; a user must now have the appropriate `extras.view_note` permissions to view existing notes. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the REST API endpoints `/api/redoc/`, `/api/swagger/`, `/api/swagger.json`, and `/api/swagger.yaml`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the `/api/graphql` REST API endpoint, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))

### Added

* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_for_url_pattern` and `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_patterns` lookup functions.
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added `nautobot.apps.views.GenericView` base class.

### Changed

* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added support for `view_name` and `view_description` optional parameters when instantiating a `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter`. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs.
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication by default on the `nautobot.core.api.AuthenticatedAPIRootView` class. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication.
* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Added requirement for user authentication to access `/api/docs/` and `/graphql/` even when `HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI` is False.

### Fixed

* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Fixed a 500 error when accessing any of the `/dcim/<port-type>/<uuid>/connect/<termination_b_type>/` view endpoints with an invalid/nonexistent `termination_b_type` string.

### Documentation

* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Updated example views in the App developer documentation to include `ObjectPermissionRequiredMixin` or `LoginRequiredMixin` as appropriate best practices.

### Housekeeping

* [#5465](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5465) - Updated custom views in the `example_plugin` to use the new `GenericView` base class as a best practice.

|  |  | Added support for `view\_name` and `view\_description` optional parameters when instantiating a `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter`. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs. |
|  |  | Added requirement for user authentication by default on the `nautobot.apps.api.APIRootView` class. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication. |

# Closes [GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4 "GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4")

# What's Changed

Cross-port of [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5464) to ltm-1.6. Due to divergence between the branches there was a decent amount of changes needed to adapt to this branch, so please review carefully, especially looking at the changes in [de5f8a6](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/de5f8a62e314fb8741d59f2661168b9e2b90da2e)

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Unauthenticated views may expose information to anonymous users

GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4
Mar 25, 2024

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.6.16,<2.1.9

## Patched versions

1.6.16,2.1.9

## Description

### Impact

A number of Nautobot URL endpoints were found to be improperly accessible to unauthenticated (anonymous) users, including the following:

* `/api/graphql/` (1)
* `/api/users/users/session/` (Nautobot 2.x only; the only information exposed to an anonymous user is which authentication backend classes are enabled on this Nautobot instance)
* `/dcim/racks/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)
* `/dcim/devices/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)
* `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`
* `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/` (the only information exposed to an anonymous user is the fact that a secrets provider with the given slug (e.g. `environment-variable` or `text-file`) is supported by this Nautobot instance)
* `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)
* `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)
* `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)
* `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid:pk>/dynamic-groups/` (1)

(1) These endpoints will not disclose any Nautobot data to an unauthenticated user unless the Nautobot configuration variable `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is changed from its default value (an empty list) to permit access to specific data by unauthenticated users.

Of these endpoints, the only one that poses any significant risk of sensitive information disclosure under normal Nautobot operation with a default configuration is `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`. This endpoint returns an HTML table containing all of the logs associated with the specified JobResult; while these logs may contain sensitive information depending on the Jobs executed in Nautobot, this exposure is mitigated somewhat by the fact that any attacker would have to have prior knowledge of the existence of a JobResult with a particular UUID.

In the interest of full disclosure, the following additional endpoints were also accessible to anonymous users, but do not disclose any sensitive data when accessed (only a listing of other API endpoints).

* `/api/`
* `/api/circuits/`
* `/api/dcim/`
* `/api/extras/`
* `/api/ipam/`
* `/api/plugins/`
* `/api/tenancy/`
* `/api/users/`
* `/api/virtualization/`

All of the above endpoints have been corrected to require user authentication, with the exception of `/api/users/users/session/` which is unused at this time and therefore has been simply removed from Nautobot 2.1.9. Additionally, we have added test automation which enumerates available Nautobot URL endpoints and verifies that appropriate authentication requirements are in place; this test was instrumental in identifying the above comprehensive list.

### Patches

Fixes will be included in Nautobot 1.6.16 and 2.1.9.

### Workarounds

Partial workaround: If your configuration includes a non-default value for `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` (the Nautobot default is an empty list), reverting it to default will prevent exposure of Nautobot information to unauthenticated users via the endpoints marked with (1) above.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## What's Changed

### Security

* [#5450](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5450) - Updated `django` to `~3.2.25` due to `CVE-2024-27351`.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/`; furthermore it will not allow an authenticated user to view log entries for a JobResult they don't otherwise have permission to view. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/dry-run/`; a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on the `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint; a user who has `view` permissions for a subset of interfaces is no longer permitted to query other interfaces for which they lack permissions. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added narrower permissions enforcement on all `<app>/<model>/<uuid>/notes/` UI endpoints; a user must now have the appropriate `extras.view_note` permissions to view existing notes. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the REST API endpoints `/api/redoc/`, `/api/swagger/`, `/api/swagger.json`, and `/api/swagger.yaml`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the `/api/graphql` REST API endpoint, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication to access the endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/`. ([GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4))

### Added

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_for_url_pattern` and `nautobot.apps.utils.get_url_patterns` lookup functions.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added `nautobot.apps.views.GenericView` base class.

### Changed

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added support for `view_name` and `view_description` optional parameters when instantiating a `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter`. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs.
* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Added requirement for user authentication by default on the `nautobot.apps.api.APIRootView` class. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication.

### Removed

* [#5464](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5464) - Removed the URL endpoints `/api/users/users/my-profile/`, `/api/users/users/session/`, `/api/users/tokens/authenticate/`, and `/api/users/tokens/logout/` as they are unused at this time.

### Fixed

* [#5413](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/5413) - Updated Device "LLDP Neighbors" detail panel to handle LLDP neighbors with MAC address as port-id.

# Closes [GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4 "GHSA-m732-wvh2-7cq4")

# What's Changed

## Security fixes

* The endpoint `/extras/job-results/<uuid:pk>/log-table/` now requires user authentication to access, and also enforces appropriate JobResult `view` permissions now.
* The endpoint `/extras/secrets/provider/<str:provider_slug>/form/` now requires user authentication to access.
* Removed the URL endpoints `/api/users/users/my-profile/`, `/api/users/users/session/`, `/api/users/tokens/authenticate/`, and `/api/users/tokens/logout/` as they are unused at this time.
* The `/api/graphql/` REST API endpoint now requires user authentication to execute GraphQL queries, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured.
* The `nautobot.apps.api.APIRootView` class now enforces user authentication by default. As a consequence, viewing the browsable REST API root endpoints (e.g. `/api/`, `/api/circuits/`, `/api/dcim/`, etc.) now requires user authentication.
* The endpoints `/dcim/racks/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/dcim/devices/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/prefixes/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/ipam/ip-addresses/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, `/virtualization/clusters/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/`, and `/virtualization/virtual-machines/<uuid>/dynamic-groups/` now require user authentication, even when `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` is configured.

## Additional permissions enforcement

* The `/api/dcim/connected-device/?peer_device=...&?peer_interface=...` REST API endpoint now requires the requesting user to have `view` permission on the specified `peer_interface`.
* The endpoints `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/sync/` and `/extras/git-repositories/<uuid:pk>/dry-run/` have corrected permissions now - a user who has `change` permissions for a subset of Git repositories is no longer permitted to sync or dry-run other repositories for which they lack the appropriate permissions.
* Viewing Notes associated to a given model now requires `extras.view_note` permissions for each note to display (this is consistent with how change log views for a model enforce `extras.view_objectchange` permissions).

## Bug fixes, housekeeping, documentation

* Fixed a 500 error when accessing any of the `/dcim/<port-type>/<uuid>/connect/<termination_b_type>/` view endpoints with an invalid/nonexistent `termination_b_type` string.
* The `nautobot.apps.api.OrderedDefaultRouter` class now accepts a `view_name` and/or `view_description` as parameters. Specifying these parameters is to be preferred over defining a custom `APIRootView` subclass when defining App API URLs.
* Updated example views in the App developer documentation to include `ObjectPermissionRequiredMixin` or `LoginRequiredMixin` as appropriate best practices.
* Updated custom views in the `example_plugin` to include `LoginRequiredMixin` as a best practice.
* Added integration test case that enumerates all registered URL patterns and verifies that they return appropriate response codes when accessed by an unauthenticated user.

# Screenshots

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Example Plugin Updates (when adding/changing features)
* Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design

Sorry, something went wrong.

Should this be `get_valid_url_for_url_pattern` or `get_fake_url_for_url_pattern` maybe?

This would be a good test to expose to apps. Not blocking but should we write a generic test for this?

I do plan/want to add a generic test to the cookiecutter that takes in the app's urlconf and iterates/validates its url patterns, yeah. I like the idea of implementing the bulk of it in core rather than in the cookiecutter but that'll take some thinking about how to do it.

Is there a reason this is not:

```
if getattr(view, "name", None) is not None:
    return view.name
```

OR

```
name = getattr(view, "name", None)
if name is not None:
    return name
```

Just looks weird to me as written?
