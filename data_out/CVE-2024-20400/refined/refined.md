Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of HTTP request parameters within the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is an open redirect, which allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary, potentially malicious, webpage.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of proper validation on HTTP request parameters allows manipulation of the redirect target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Redirection:** A successful exploit redirects a user to a malicious web page. This could lead to:
    *   Phishing attacks by directing users to fake login pages.
    *   Malware distribution by redirecting users to sites hosting malicious software.
    *   Other malicious activity that can be carried out via a compromised website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by intercepting and modifying HTTP requests sent by a user to the Cisco Expressway device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted Cisco Expressway device.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or User Interaction:** The attacker needs to intercept and modify a legitimate user's HTTP request (MitM) or trick the user to click on a crafted malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects both Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
