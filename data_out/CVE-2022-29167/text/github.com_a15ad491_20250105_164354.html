# ReDoS vulnerability in header parsing

Moderate

[lotas](/lotas)
published
GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq
May 4, 2022

## Package

npm

hawk
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<9.0.1

## Patched versions

9.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially.

### Patches

`parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead.

### Workarounds

`Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.
