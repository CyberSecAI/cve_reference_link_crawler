- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BigContact WordPress plugin (<= 1.5.8) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to execute unwanted actions on the web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful CSRF attack can allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions it allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious link or code that triggers the vulnerable function in the plugin from another website or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
