- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper memory management for new incoming SSL/TLS connections on Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv) platforms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource management (CWE-789), specifically, insufficient memory management when handling new SSL/TLS connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exhaust system memory, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can lead to slow or ceased SSL VPN connection processing. While the memory might be reclaimed slowly after an attack, a manual reload of the device may be required for rapid restoration of services.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large number of new incoming SSL/TLS connections to the targeted virtual platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to establish SSL/TLS connections with the targeted device.
