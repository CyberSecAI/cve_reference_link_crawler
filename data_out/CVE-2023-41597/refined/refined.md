Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of the `active_t` parameter within the `twitter.php` file of EyouCms v1.6.2.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Defacement of the webpage
        *   Redirection to malicious websites
        *   Data theft
        *   Other client-side attacks

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code injected into the `active_t` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to click the malicious URL.

**Additional Details**
* The provided content gives a specific example of the malicious URL: `/admin/twitter.php?active_t=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E`. This URL demonstrates how the attacker injects a simple JavaScript alert as a proof-of-concept.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a logged-in user accesses the crafted URL.
*   The maintainers acknowledged the vulnerability and indicated a fix would be included in the next version.
