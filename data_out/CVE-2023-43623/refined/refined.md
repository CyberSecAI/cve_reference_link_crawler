- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can determine valid usernames, enabling brute-force attacks with valid users.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the affected application.
