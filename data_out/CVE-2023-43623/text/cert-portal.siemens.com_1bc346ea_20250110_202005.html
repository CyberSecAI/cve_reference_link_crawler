PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix Forgot Password module allows your users to sign-up for your application or reset their own
password without administrator involvement.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-43623

Applications using the affected module are vulnerable to user enumeration due to distinguishable
responses. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine if a user is valid or not,
enabling a brute force attack with valid users.
