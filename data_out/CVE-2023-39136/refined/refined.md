{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `_sanitizedPath` function in `ZIPArchive` attempts to sanitize file paths by prepending `file:///`, standardizing it with `NSURL`, and then removing the prefix. However, when the input path is `/..`, the standardized path becomes `file://` which is 7 characters long while the code expects a minimum of 8 characters when removing the prefix which leads to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the inadequate handling of edge cases where the sanitized path is shorter than expected after URL standardization, causing a crash during string manipulation."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a zip file with a filename of `/..`.",
      "Extracting the crafted zip file using a vulnerable version of ZIPArchive."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious zip file and have the victim extract this file with a vulnerable `ZIPArchive` library."
