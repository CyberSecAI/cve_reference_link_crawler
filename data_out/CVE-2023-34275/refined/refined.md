  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection, authentication bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability through the SOAP API interface on TCP port 80.",
