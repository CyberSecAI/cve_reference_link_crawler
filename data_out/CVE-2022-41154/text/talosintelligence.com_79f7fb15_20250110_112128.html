# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1637

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD m2m DELETE\_FILE cmd directory traversal vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-41154

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the m2m DELETE\_FILE cmd functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary file deletion. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial router with several functionalities and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many other

The QUARTZ-GOLD offers a feature called `M2M`. When enabled, the device will execute the `m2m` binary and offer different network services. One of the services the `m2m` binary offers handles several commands. To communicate with this service the client must send a specific UDP packet format.

Following the portion of `m2m` binary that manages the `DELETE_FILE` command:

```
[...]
cmdid_provided_LB = UDP_data_buff.cmd_id >> 8;
if (cmdid_provided == 0x15) {
  syslog(5,"M2M Command(%02x) DELETE_FILE!!!",0x15);
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._0_1_ = 0x80;
  m2m_UDP_packet_resp.cmd_id._1_1_ = cmdid_provided_LB;
  [... set base_folder variable ...]
  base_folder_length = strlen(base_folder);
  for (current_entry_off = 0; current_entry_off < (actual_data_len_recv - 0x22);
      current_entry_off = current_entry_off + __bswap_16(previous_data_len)){
    current_data_len = __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off));
    if ((( __bswap_16(*(UDP_data_buff.fix_word + data_idx)) != 0x12)) ||
        (((actual_data_len_recv - 0x22) - current_entry_off) < current_data_len) ||
        (command_string = calloc(current_data_len + base_folder_length + 0xc,1),
        command_string == 0x0)) {                                                                               [1]
      [... invalid state ...]
    }
    sprintf(command_string,"rm -rf %s/%s &",base_folder,&UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data + current_entry_off
           );                                                                                                   [2]
    syslog(6,"Deleting file :%s",command_string + 7);
    system(command_string);
    free(command_string);
    previous_data_len = *(UDP_data_buff.entries[0].data_len + current_entry_off);                               [3]
    [...]

```

Following, we will briefly explain the packet composition for this command:

```
struct M2M_data_entry{
        uint16_t fix_word;
        uint16_t data_len;
        char data[];
};

struct M2M_packet{
        uint16_t packet_len;
        uint16_t cmd_id;
        uint32_t pkd_id;
        uint16_t version;
        M2M_data_entry entries[];
};

```

The UDP packet received, which can contain at most 0x251c bytes, is cast to an `M2M_packet`. This is a variable length structure. Indeed, inside of it there is an array of `M2M_data_entry` structure that is a variable length struct. To seek the various entries, the variable `current_entry_off` is used. It starts with value 0 and then, at `[3]`, the value `M2M_data_entry.data_len` of the just-parsed entry is added to seek, in the next loop, the next entry.

The `DELETE_FILE` command will execute the command `rm -rf <base_folder>/<M2M_data_entry.data> &` for each entry in the UDP `M2M_packet` packet it received.

At `[2]` the `rm -rf <base_folder>/<M2M_data_entry.data> &` string is composed and executed. At `[1]` some checks are performed, but none about the content of the `M2M_data_entry.data`. Because any value of `M2M_data_entry.data` is allowed, this function is vulnerable to a directory path traversal vulnerability. This leads to arbitrary file deletion.
