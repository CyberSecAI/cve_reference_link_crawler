- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Customers Manager plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the user deletion functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, specifically when deleting user accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a crafted link that, when clicked by an authenticated admin, triggers the deletion of a user specified within the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to click a malicious link.
