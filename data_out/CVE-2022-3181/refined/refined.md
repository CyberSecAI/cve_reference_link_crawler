- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the processing of HTTP requests. A specifically malformed HTTP request can cause the VTScada application to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The software does not properly validate incoming HTTP requests, allowing specially crafted requests to trigger a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The affected VTScada application crashes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via malformed HTTP requests. This affects both local area network (LAN)-only and internet-facing systems configured to accept incoming HTTP(S) connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable VTScada system. No authentication or special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. Attack complexity is low.
