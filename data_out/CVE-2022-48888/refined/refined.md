The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48888.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `msm_mdss_parse_data_bus_icc_path` function within the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem for MSM (Qualcomm Snapdragon) graphics. The function uses `of_icc_get()` to allocate resources for ICC paths. Specifically, it allocates resources for both "mdp0-mem" (path0) and "mdp1-mem" (path1). An early return after checking `path0` for errors could lead to path1 memory leak if path1 is allocated before this check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory for 'path1' is not freed when an error occurs while allocating or retrieving 'path0', leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code could lead to memory exhaustion and potentially system instability or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the vulnerable function in the DRM subsystem, specifically during the parsing of device tree data for data bus ICC paths. It is likely accessible to the userland through API access to graphics driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger the `msm_mdss_parse_data_bus_icc_path` function, which is part of the DRM subsystem. This could involve interactions with the graphics driver.
