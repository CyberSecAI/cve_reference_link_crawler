The content is related to CVE-2024-47184.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Democratic Playlist Name is not properly sanitized, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the `democratic->name` variable is directly inserted into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization in `public/templates/show_democratic.inc.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view a page that displays the vulnerable playlist name. This can lead to privilege escalation (e.g., a compromised Catalog Manager escalating their privileges to Admin) or account compromise (e.g., stealing the Admin's account by stealing their cookies or session token).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker with the necessary privileges (Admin or Catalog Manager) can create a malicious playlist name with a crafted XSS payload. Any user who views the page displaying this playlist name will trigger the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an Admin or Catalog Manager to create or edit a democratic playlist. User interaction is required when the victim views the playlist with the malicious name.
