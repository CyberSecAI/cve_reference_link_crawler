- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `strcpy` function is used to copy user-controlled input into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `password` parameter from a POST request is copied into a 128-byte buffer (`v35`) without any size validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. By overflowing the `v35` buffer, an attacker can potentially overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to redirect execution to injected malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request with a long `password` parameter to the `/goform/execCommand` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) implies that no prior authentication is required, as the password is being provided through the "Cookie" header.
