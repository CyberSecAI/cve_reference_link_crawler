- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The light client does not check if the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of chain ID verification in the light client implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could provide a header from a different chain that fulfills all other verification requirements (e.g., sufficient overlapping validator signatures) to deceive a light client. This could lead to the light client accepting data from the wrong chain. The impact is listed as low confidentiality and low integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, as an attacker would need to supply a malicious header over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to find a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies the light client's other verification criteria (e.g., enough overlapping validator signatures) and be able to transmit this to a vulnerable node. The attack is considered to be of high complexity.
