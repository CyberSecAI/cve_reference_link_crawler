- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection on the user profile update functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability in the `edit-profile.php` file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unintentionally modifying their profile details (first name, last name, contact) by submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page, or a URL that is sent to a logged in user and is triggered when that user visits that page or URL, leading to an unintended state change of the user's profile.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTML page with a CSRF payload or a crafted URL and trick a logged-in user into visiting it, while the victim is authenticated.
