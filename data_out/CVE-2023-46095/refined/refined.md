{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Smooth Scroll Links plugin does not implement sufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions within the application, under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, that sends a forged request to the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any authentication. They need to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to perform the action being targeted via CSRF."
