Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `SendFileServlet` class within the Jreport software. Specifically, the servlet does not properly validate user-supplied paths when handling requests to the `/sendfile/` endpoint, particularly those starting with `/help/`. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to traverse directories outside of the intended web application's file structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to use ".." sequences in the requested file path to move up directory levels. This allows access to files outside of the intended web application's directory.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users because the affected code path within `SendFileServlet` is reachable without any login or authentication check.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** By leveraging path traversal, an attacker can request any file on the server's file system that the application has permission to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read any file from the server, potentially revealing sensitive information. This may include configuration files, source code, database connection details, credentials, or other private data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially obtain system-related information, user login details (if stored on the filesystem), and application configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/jreport/sendfile/` endpoint, using the `/help/` path as a starting point.
*   **Path Traversal Characters:** The attacker uses `..` sequences in the URL to navigate the file system outside the intended directory, e.g., `/jreport/sendfile/help/../../../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jreport server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Path Traversal Techniques:** The attacker must be aware of how to craft a URL containing path traversal sequences.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided exploit code includes a python script that automates the file retrieval by crafting the malicious URLs.
* The exploit targets Jreport version 15.6, it is possible other versions are affected as well.
* The vulnerability is applicable to both Linux and Windows environments.
