Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5374 (Although this is a placeholder, the provided content clearly describes an XSS vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `submit_new_faculty.php` file of the College Management System. Specifically, the `address` parameter is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-provided input for the `address` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This allows attackers to perform various actions, including:
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Displaying inappropriate content on the victim's browser.
    - Downloading malware onto the victim's system without their consent.
- **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can damage the reputation of the website owner, as users may perceive the website as untrustworthy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `address` parameter in the `submit_new_faculty.php` file.
- An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript and injects it into the `address` parameter. When a user views the page containing the unsanitized output, the JavaScript will execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `address` parameter in the `submit_new_faculty.php` file.
- No privileged access is mentioned as being necessary in the provided context.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `address` in `submit_new_faculty.php`.
- The provided payload is `address=555'"()&%<zzz><ScRiPt >alert(9352)</ScRiPt>`.
