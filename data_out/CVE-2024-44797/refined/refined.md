The provided content is related to CVE-2024-44797.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of the `$_GET['view']` parameter in the `enable_requests.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input.
- Lack of input validation and output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g. cookies, session tokens)
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `enable_requests.php` file with a malicious payload within the `view` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable page and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker does not need any special access or credentials beyond the ability to browse to the vulnerable page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `sections/tools/managers/enable_requests.php` file.
- The vulnerable code is located in the following lines of the file:
    - `<input type="hidden" name="view" value="<?=$_GET['view']?>" />` (Line 159)
    - `<td><input type="text" name="username" value="<?=$_GET['username']?>" /></td>` (Line 164)
- The reported Proof of Concept (PoC) is: `GET sections/tools/managers/enable_requests.php?view=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22`
- The issue is reported to affect staff and FLS, which implies the affected functionality might be specific to certain user roles.
