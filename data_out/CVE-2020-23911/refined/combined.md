### **[thoger](/thoger)** commented [May 14, 2021](#issuecomment-841518191)

| The crash is caused by this debug/error message:  <https://github.com/vlm/asn1c/blob/v0.9.28/libasn1fix/asn1fix_enum.c#L82>  ``` FATAL("HERE HERE HERE", 1);  ```  It looks like some temporary message added while debugging some issue, but that assumption is hard to confirm as it was included in the initial import to git.  The `FATAL` macro effectively expands to something like this:  ``` printf("HERE HERE HERE" " in %s", 1, source_file_name);  ```  leading to `%s` format applied to argument `1` (i.e. pointer 0x1) instead of the file name string.  The most trivial fix is to remove extraneous `, 1` argument. A better fix would be to remove the `FATAL` call completely if it's not needed, or user proper message if it is needed. |
