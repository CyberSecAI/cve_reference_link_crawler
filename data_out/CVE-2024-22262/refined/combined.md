# CVE-2024-22262: Spring Framework URL Parsing with Host Validation (3rd report)

HIGH | APRIL 11, 2024 | CVE-2024-22262
# Description

Applications that use `UriComponentsBuilder` to parse an externally provided URL (e.g. through a query parameter) *AND* perform validation checks on the host of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to a [open redirect](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) attack or to a SSRF attack if the URL is used after passing validation checks.

This is the same as [CVE-2024-22259](https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22259) and [CVE-2024-22243](https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22243), but with different input.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

Spring Framework

* 6.1.0 - 6.1.5
* 6.0.0 - 6.0.18
* 5.3.0 - 5.3.33
* Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

| Affected version(s) | Fix version | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6.1.x | 6.1.6 | OSS |
| 6.0.x | 6.0.19 | OSS |
| 5.3.x | 5.3.34 | OSS |
