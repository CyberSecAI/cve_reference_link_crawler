The provided content details a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the D-Link DIR-823X AX3000 Dual-Band Gigabit Wireless Router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a format string vulnerability in the `sub_412B04` function. This function uses `system` to execute a command constructed with a user-controlled parameter `a2` from the `ntp_zone_val` field, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format string vulnerability:** The `uciSet` function uses a format string that takes user-controlled input (`ntp_zone_val`) and incorporates it directly into a system call, without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Lack of input validation:** The firmware fails to properly sanitize or validate the `ntp_zone_val` field before using it in a system command, which enables the injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with administrative privileges on the router's firmware file system.
- **Complete system compromise:** The attacker can potentially take full control of the device, including modifying settings, capturing network traffic, or using the device in botnets.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/set_ntp` CGI endpoint.
- **`ntp_zone_val` field:** The malicious payload is injected into the `ntp_zone_val` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials (username and password) to authenticate with the router's web interface in order to send the malicious request.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to log in to the router, obtain the required session and token, and then send the crafted HTTP POST request with the malicious `ntp_zone_val` payload to execute a command.
- The exploit uses double quotes and a semicolon to inject the arbitrary command in the format string.
- The specific firmware version vulnerable is mentioned as  `固件-240126`, linked to the official website.
