Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Avada theme for WordPress, in versions 7.11.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The theme allows a malicious actor to make the server initiate requests to arbitrary domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Domain Requests:** An attacker can force the vulnerable server to make requests to a domain of their choosing.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow attackers to find sensitive information of other services running on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the Avada theme on a WordPress site

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable website in such a way that they can trigger the SSRF vulnerability, and based on the required privilege being 'Contributor', it can be assumed that this is a user-level attack.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is classified as low severity and unlikely to be exploited, but still presents a potential risk.
* A virtual patch is available to mitigate the issue until the theme can be updated.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.11.2.
