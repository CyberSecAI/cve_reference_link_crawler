The provided content relates to CVE-2024-37561.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, which allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These injected scripts will then be executed when users visit the site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
- Redirects to malicious websites.
- Display of unwanted advertisements.
- Execution of arbitrary HTML payloads.
- Website compromise and unauthorized actions

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed when users visit the site. The specific injection point is not detailed, but XSS vulnerabilities commonly involve unsanitized user inputs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the affected plugin. The required privilege for exploitation is an Administrator account.
