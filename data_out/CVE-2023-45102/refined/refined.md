- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious requests that are triggered by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into initiating a crafted request. The attacker doesn't need authentication to exploit the vulnerability itself.
