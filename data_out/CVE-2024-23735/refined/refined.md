Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23735:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) based XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability found in the S/MIME certificate upload functionality of the User Profile pages in S/Notify for Confluence.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF: An attacker can forge a request that, if initiated by a user logged into the vulnerable application, will execute the attacker's crafted malicious payload.
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the user's profile through a crafted S/MIME certificate. This malicious script is stored and executed when a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim user's browser session.
- This allows the attacker to perform actions that the victim user can perform, potentially leading to:
  - Accessing and modifying user data.
  - Deletion of data.
  - Theft of data.
  - Accessing or deleting files.
  - Stealing session cookies.
  - Hijacking user sessions.
  - Impersonating a legitimate user to carry out further malicious attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be initiated by a user clicking a malicious link in an email or by visiting a malicious website.
- The attacker would need to convince the user to initiate the request while logged into the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the application.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim user to initiate a crafted request, while logged into Confluence.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious S/MIME certificate.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects S/Notify for Confluence, specifically when S/MIME user uploads are enabled. It does not affect S/Notify for Jira or Bitbucket, or if PGP key uploads are enabled instead of S/MIME.
- The severity is considered "moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.1.
- Versions up to and including 4.0.0 of S/Notify for Confluence are affected.
- The vulnerability was found during a penetration test and is not reported as actively exploited.
- A temporary mitigation is disabling S/MIME certificate uploads in the S/Notify user key management settings.
