Based on the provided information, both commits address the same vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer object (bo) was not properly unreferenced in the error path within the `intel_fb_bo_framebuffer_init` function of the `drivers/gpu/drm/xe/display/intel_fb_bo.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Failure to unreference the buffer object on error paths leads to a memory leak, as the allocated memory for the buffer object is not freed when the initialization fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated failures in the framebuffer initialization can cause the memory usage to increase over time, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an error during framebuffer initialization in the `intel_fb_bo_framebuffer_init` function. This could be achieved by providing specific input or conditions that would cause the function to fail and enter an error path, like an invalid  `XE_BO_SCANOUT_BIT` flag, or failure to reserve the buffer object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem and trigger the `intel_fb_bo_framebuffer_init` function with malicious or error-causing parameters.
