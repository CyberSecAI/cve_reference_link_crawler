{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` lacks proper validation for input and output tensors, specifically `orig_input` and `orig_output`, allowing for out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault by crafting specific input tensors.",
    "attack_vectors": "By calling the `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` operation with maliciously crafted `orig_input`, `orig_output`, and other tensor parameters.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad`."
