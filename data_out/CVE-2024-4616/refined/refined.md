- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that could be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to any page where the vulnerable "User Login/Registration" widget is active, with a malicious payload in the `login_username` and/or `login_password` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to send a crafted POST request to the website.
