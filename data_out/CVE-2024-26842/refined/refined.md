The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26842.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a shift operation in the `ufshcd_clear_cmd` function within the Linux kernel's UFS (Universal Flash Storage) driver. When the `task_tag` is greater than or equal to 32 (in MCQ mode) and the size of an `unsigned int` is 4 bytes, the expression `1U << task_tag` results in a bitwise shift that is out of bounds for a 32-bit mask (`u32`), leading to undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds bitwise shift:** The code uses a left bit shift to create a mask, but doesn't validate the shift amount against the size of the target variable, leading to a shift out of bounds. This is a classic case of a shift issue or an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel panic/crash:** The out-of-bounds shift can corrupt memory, leading to a kernel panic, which is a denial-of-service (DoS). The provided call trace from the mrdump output shows this clearly.
- **System instability:**  Memory corruption can lead to unpredictable behavior and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **UFS device interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when interacting with a UFS device, specifically during the command clearing process.
- **MCQ mode:** The vulnerability only occurs when operating in MCQ (Multi Command Queue) mode and `task_tag >= 32`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to trigger UFS commands:** The attacker needs the ability to trigger UFS commands that lead to the execution of the vulnerable code path.
- **UFS device access:** An attacker would likely need to be running code that could interact with the UFS storage subsystem.

**Patch Information:**
The fix involves initializing the `mask` variable before using it and moving the shift operation to after the `return 0` condition:

```
This patch ensures that the mask is computed correctly before being used in `ufshcd_utrl_clear`. The crash information also shows that the call to `ufshcd_utrl_clear`  is causing the exception, so this fix is well targeted.
