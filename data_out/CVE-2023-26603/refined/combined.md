# MNDT-2024-0003

## Description

JumpCloud agent installer contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability which affected versions 1.147.0 and prior.

## Impact

High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker SYSTEM level privileges

## Exploitability

Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce

## CVE Reference

CVE-2023-26603

## Common Weakness Enumeration

CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

The installation of the agent uses the Windows Installer framework and an MSI file is cached in C:\Windows\Installer. An unprivileged user can trigger a repair operation, either by using the Windows Installer API or by running "msiexec.exe /fa c:\Windows\Installer[XXXXX].msi".

Running a repair operation will trigger a number of file operations as SYSTEM in the low-privileged user’s %TEMP% folder. Execution of files in the user’s %TEMP% folder from a SYSTEM context could lead to an attacker hijacking its execution and run arbitrary commands as SYSTEM.

## Resolution

The issue was fixed in version 1.178.0.
