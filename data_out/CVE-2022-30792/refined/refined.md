- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS runtime system allows a limited number of incoming TCP connections or channel connections. Once this limit is reached, it does not allow any new client connection. An attacker can exploit this by establishing connections until the limit is reached, preventing legitimate users from connecting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). Specifically, the CmpChannelServer and CmpChannelServerEmbedded components do not properly limit the number of communication channels, allowing an attacker to block all available channels.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can block all available communication channels, preventing legitimate users or clients from establishing new connections to the CODESYS runtime system. Repeated attacks can permanently block new connections. Existing connections are not affected.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability and needs network access to the affected CODESYS product.
