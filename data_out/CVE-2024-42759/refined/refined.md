Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Ellevo call tracking platform allows users to bypass manager approval controls by defining themselves as their own substitute approver. This is due to a flaw in the substitute registration endpoint of the application's API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Functionality Level Authorization (BFLA):** The application fails to properly validate user privileges, allowing users to access and modify functionalities they shouldn't be authorized to use.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The substitute registration API endpoint does not properly restrict the ability of a user to set themselves as a substitute approver.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The API allows any user to set any substitute, including themselves, for any other user, without proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Users can approve their own tickets, bypassing the intended approval process by managers or supervisors.
*   This can lead to unauthorized changes, approvals, or closure of tickets without proper oversight or authorization.
*   Compromise of the integrity of the ticket management system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** The attacker directly interacts with the application's API to manipulate substitute assignments.
*   The attacker leverages an authenticated session on the platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Ellevo platform.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific API endpoint for substitute registration.
*   **Ability to Manipulate API:** The attacker needs the ability to send API requests to the substitute registration endpoint.

**Steps to Reproduce (from the provided content):**

1.  Identify the login of the default approver for a ticket.
2.  Manipulate the API endpoint to set the attacker's login as a substitute for the default approver.
3.  Set a start and end date for the substitution.
4.  Open the ticket, which will then be automatically approved by the attacker's user due to being a substitute.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in version 6.2.0.38160 of the software.
* The attack can be carried out by authenticated users of the platform by using the described API manipulation.
