  "CVE-2022-29287": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference in Kentico CMS allows an administrator to access sensitive data of higher privileged users.",
    "details": "A user with the role administrator is allowed to export another userâ€™s settings if its privileges are lower than the currently logged in user. The export functionality is divided into two steps, the first of which is a rights verification step. However, this step can be bypassed by directly sending the second POST request with the objectId parameter, which allows a lower privileged user to export the settings of higher privileged users.",
    "affected_versions": "Kentico CMS version 13.0.44 and newer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference"
    ],
    "impact": "An administrator can export sensitive data of higher privileged users, such as hashed passwords.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
      "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with administrator privileges can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to have access to the software to exploit this vulnerability."
