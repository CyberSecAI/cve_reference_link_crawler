Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a hidden, unlisted web page within the Contec FLEXLAN FXA2000 and FXA3000 series devices' Wireless LAN Manager interface. This page allows execution of arbitrary Linux commands with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Hidden Functionality (CWE-912):** The presence of an undocumented web interface providing privileged access represents a significant security flaw.
- **Weak Default Password:** The default password for the device is described as very weak, which makes it easier to gain access to the hidden page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can use the hidden web page to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges. This allows for complete control over the affected device.
- **System Access:** Through the executed commands, an attacker can access all system files and modify system configurations.
- **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to install backdoors, potentially enabling persistent access and further malicious activity.
- **Telnet Port Activation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to open the telnet port and achieve full device access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely from the network.
- **Web Interface:** The hidden page is accessed through a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the device
- **Basic knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of how to access the device's web interface and how to manipulate the web requests to reach the hidden page.
- **Weak Credentials:** The attacker would need to gain access using the default login credentials.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was discovered through reverse engineering of the device's firmware.
- The provided content also mentions CVE-2022-36159, which is related to the use of weak hard-coded cryptographic keys and a backdoor account.
- The devices affected are Contec FLEXLAN FXA3000 Series devices from version 1.15.00 and under, and Contec FLEXLAN FXA2000 Series devices from version 1.38.00 and under.
