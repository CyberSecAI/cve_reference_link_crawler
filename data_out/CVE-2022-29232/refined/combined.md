[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This 2.3.x release includes multiple fixes, several of which further restrict what set of information is accessible [programatically] to meeting participants. We strongly recommend trying out this release and upgrading.

Special thanks to [@defnull](https://github.com/defnull) and [@hiroshisuga](https://github.com/hiroshisuga) for submitting fixes and to community members for [disclosing securily](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/develop/SECURITY.md) their vulnerability reports' findings!

### HTML5 client

* fix: Add meetingId to chatIds selector [#12861](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12861)
* fix(breakouts): Do not allow users to obtain 'redirectToHtml5JoinURL' for others [#12871](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12871)
* fix(polls): Avoid viewer manually subscribing to current-poll [#12872](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12872)
* fix(guests): Propagate list of pending guests only to mods [#12874](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12874)
* fix: Stop dictation when swapping languages with the voice recognition on [#12794](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12794) Thanks [@hiroshisuga](https://github.com/hiroshisuga) for the fix!
* fix(closed captions): this.recognition can be null [#12831](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12831) Thanks [@hiroshisuga](https://github.com/hiroshisuga) for the fix!
* fix: ConnectionStatus - log info on 'warning' [#12816](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12816)

### Core

* fix(common-web): Sub-processes hang if output buffers fill up [#12842](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/12842) Thanks [@defnull](https://github.com/defnull) for the report and fix!

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-230 version. Use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-230-2.3.9`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-230`.

This is the third release of BigBlueButton 2.4 and includes numerous fixes and stability improvements.

Note that it runs on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) and HTML5 client runs on Node 12 (same as BigBlueButton 2.3).

BigBlueButton 2.4-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.4/new.html>

Special thanks to community member [@PhMemmel](https://github.com/PhMemmel) for his fix and to others for their feedback to the earlier 2.4 releases!

This release includes all 2.3.x changes up to and including 2.3.9.

#### bbb-web API field validation:

In the previous release (2.4-alpha-2) we added new bbb-web validation rules. We will be adjusting the docs but wanted to outline the changes in a release notes memo too:

* meeting name

  + must be between 2 and 256 chars (new rule)
* external meeting id

  + cannot contain `,`
  + must be between 2 and 256 chars (new rule)
* password

  + must be between 2 and 64 characters long (new rule)

### SFU

bbb-webrtc-sfu switched to [v2.6.x](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/releases/tag/v2.6.0-alpha.6f7793e)

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-240 version, use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-240-2.4-beta-1`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-240`.

### Client build: 1351
