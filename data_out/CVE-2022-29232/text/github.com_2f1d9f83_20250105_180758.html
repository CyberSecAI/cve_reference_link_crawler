This is the third release of BigBlueButton 2.4 and includes numerous fixes and stability improvements.

Note that it runs on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) and HTML5 client runs on Node 12 (same as BigBlueButton 2.3).

BigBlueButton 2.4-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.4/new.html>

Special thanks to community member [@PhMemmel](https://github.com/PhMemmel) for his fix and to others for their feedback to the earlier 2.4 releases!

This release includes all 2.3.x changes up to and including 2.3.9.

#### bbb-web API field validation:

In the previous release (2.4-alpha-2) we added new bbb-web validation rules. We will be adjusting the docs but wanted to outline the changes in a release notes memo too:

* meeting name

  + must be between 2 and 256 chars (new rule)
* external meeting id

  + cannot contain `,`
  + must be between 2 and 256 chars (new rule)
* password

  + must be between 2 and 64 characters long (new rule)

### SFU

bbb-webrtc-sfu switched to [v2.6.x](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/releases/tag/v2.6.0-alpha.6f7793e)

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-240 version, use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command

`bionic-240-2.4-beta-1`

We still recommend using `-v bionic-240`.

### Client build: 1351
