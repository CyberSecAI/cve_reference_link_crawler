    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload and tricking a user into accessing it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (unauthenticated attacker).
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim user to click a malicious link.
