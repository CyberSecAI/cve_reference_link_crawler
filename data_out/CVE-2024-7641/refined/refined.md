Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `deactivate_act.php` file of the SourceCodester Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System 1.0. Specifically, user-supplied data from the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs when untrusted input is directly embedded into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to:
    *   Data breaches: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
    *   Privilege escalation: Manipulating database users and their permissions.
    *   System compromise: Potentially gaining control of the underlying system by exploiting database features or stored procedures.
*  **Database takeover:** Full database compromise, potentially allowing for lateral movement to other systems connected to the network

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `deactivate_act.php` script. The `id` parameter within this request is where the malicious SQL injection payload is injected.
*   **Target:**  The specific target is the `deactivate_act.php` file, specifically its handling of the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. This could be local network access, or it could originate from the public internet, depending on the deployment of the application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to construct a successful payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not indicate any specific authentication is required for the `deactivate_act.php` script, suggesting the vulnerability could potentially be exploited without prior authorization.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `deactivate_act.php` script of the application.
*   The vulnerable code occurs around line 8 in the `deactivate_act.php` file, where unsanitized user input is passed directly to an SQL query.
*   The `id` parameter passed via the HTTP GET request is the entry point for the SQL injection.
*   Tools such as `sqlmap.py` can be used to test and exploit this vulnerability.
