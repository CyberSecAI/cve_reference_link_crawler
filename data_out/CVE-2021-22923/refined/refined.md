Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22923:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the curl tool's implementation of the Metalink feature. When a user provides credentials to download a Metalink XML file, those same credentials are then reused for all subsequent downloads from the URLs specified within the Metalink XML file, without the user's explicit knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Credential Reuse:**  The curl tool improperly reuses credentials provided for downloading a Metalink file when fetching content from the URLs listed in the Metalink file.
- **Insufficient Protection of Credentials (CWE-522):** User credentials are not adequately protected and are sent to unintended servers without informing the user of this action.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** User credentials (username and password) can be exposed to potentially untrusted servers specified in the Metalink XML file.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  If the credentials being reused provide access to a protected resource, that resource could be accessed by the servers receiving the credentials through this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Metalink Feature:** An attacker could craft a malicious Metalink XML file that includes URLs to attacker-controlled servers. When a user attempts to download content via this malicious Metalink file using curl with authentication to get the Metalink XML file, the attacker's server will receive the user's credentials when the content is downloaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious Metalink File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Metalink XML file containing malicious URLs.
- **Network Position:** The attacker does not need a privileged position in the network. They only need to host their malicious server and ensure it is referenced in the crafted Metalink file.
- **User Interaction:** The user must initiate the download of the malicious Metalink XML file using curl with username and password.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the curl tool and does not affect the libcurl library.
- The Metalink feature has been completely removed from curl version 7.78.0 onwards to fix this and other related vulnerabilities.
- Affected versions of curl include versions 7.27.0 up to and including 7.77.0.
- A workaround for earlier versions is to rebuild curl with the Metalink support disabled.
- The severity is rated as Medium.
- The vulnerability is caused by the reuse of credentials without informing the user.
- This vulnerability is also present in several NetApp products, according to the NetApp advisory.
