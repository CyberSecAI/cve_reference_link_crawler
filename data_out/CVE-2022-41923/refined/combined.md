# Grails Spring Security Core Plugin Improper Privilege Management Vulnerability

By Matthew Moss

November 22, 2022

**Information regarding CVE-2022-41923**

## Overview

The Grails team has confirmed a security vulnerability found in the Grails Spring Security Core plugin, initially identified by Adrien Peter and Benjamin Sepe from [Synacktiv](https://www.synacktiv.com/), and investigated and reported by Arek Bazylewicz of [ID5](https://id5.io). This vulnerability has been assigned identifier [CVE-2022-41923](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41923).

The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack.

**Update**: Synacktiv has made available their [security advisory (PDF)](https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/Synacktiv-Grails-Spring-Security-CVE-2022-41923.pdf) on this vulnerability.

## Impacted Applications

Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions:

* 1.x
* 2.x
* >=3.0.0 <3.3.2
* >=4.0.0 <4.0.5
* >=5.0.0 <5.1.1

We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin.

## Protecting Your Applications

The following Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions have been patched for this vulnerability:

* [3.3.2](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v3.3.2)
* [4.0.5](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v4.0.5)
* [5.1.1](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v5.1.1)

The best way to protect your Grails framework application is to upgrade to a patched release of this plugin.

If you are unable to upgrade to a patched version of the plugin, you can work around the issue with a small code and configuration change described in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/grails/GSSC-CVE-2022-41923). We have provided workaround examples for Grails framework 2 through 5 applications. A demonstration of the vulnerability will be provided in time, after users have an opportunity to patch their applications.

## Looking Forward

The Grails Foundation and the Grails development team take application security very seriously. We are continuing to research and monitor this vulnerability and will update this post with new information as it is discovered.

If you have questions about this vulnerability or need assistance on upgrades or workarounds, please see the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/issues/844) or contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8d9b9d8b8c978a87be998c9f97928dd0918c99).

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core (GSSC) plugin, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in GSSC plugin versions [3.3.2](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v3.3.2), [4.0.5](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v4.0.5), and [5.1.1](https://github.com/grails/grails-spring-security-core/releases/tag/v5.1.1).

### Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade to a patched version of the plugin, the [GSSC-CVE-2022-41923](https://github.com/grails/GSSC-CVE-2022-41923) repository contains workarounds for GSSC plugin versions 2.x through 5.x. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as *no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin*.

### References

Please see the [Grails blog post](https://grails.org/blog/2022-11-22-ss-plugin-auth-cve.html) for additional information and updates.

# Workaround for CVE-2022-41923: Privilege Management Vulnerability

## Summary

The vulnerability [CVE-2022-41923](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41923)
found in the unpatched Grails Spring Security Core (GSSC) plugin can result in
[improper privilege management](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html).
This repository describes how to work around the issue.

If you are using an unpatched version of the plugin, we recommend highly that you upgrade to a patched version.
If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we encourage you to implement the workaround described in this document.
*This is especially important if you are using GSSC plugin version 2.x, as no patch is available for version 2.x.*

## Preparation

In order to correctly configure the workaround, you need to know:

* The version of the GSSC plugin your application employs. Look for the version number in your `build.gradle` file.
  (For Grails 2.x, look in the `BuildConfig.groovy` file).
* What security configuration type you are using: that is, the configuration value for
  `grails.plugin.springsecurity.securityConfigType`

| Config Value | Documentation Reference |
| --- | --- |
| `Annotation` (default) | [Secured Annotations](https://grails.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/latest/index.html#securedAnnotations) |
| `InterceptUrlMap` | [Static Map](https://grails.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/latest/index.html#configGroovyMap) |
| `Requestmap` | [Requestmap Instances](https://grails.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/latest/index.html#requestmapInstances) |

Note: In all the instructions and configuration below, the `demo` package is used.
Change this package appropriately for your application and the location you place the patched source files.

## Workaround for GSSC Plugin (versions 3.x - 5.x)

Determine the workaround class you need based on your security configuration type.

| Config Value | Workaround Class |
| --- | --- |
| `Annotation` | `PatchedAnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` |
| `InterceptUrlMap` | `PatchedInterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` |
| `Requestmap` | `PatchedRequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` |

Copy the corresponding source file into your `src/main/groovy` source tree.

Finally, add the following configuration to your `application.groovy` config file,
replacing `PatchedAnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` with the needed workaround class.

```
grails.plugin.springsecurity.objectDefinitionSourceBeanClass = 'demo.PatchedAnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition'
```

## Workaround for GSSC Plugin (version 2.x)

As above, determine the workaround class you need based on your security configuration type.
Copy the corresponding source file into your `src/groovy` source tree.
Then edit your bean configuration based on your application's security configuration type.

#### Security Config Type: Annotation

If using security configuration type `Annotation`, edit the `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy` to include:

```
import demo.PatchedAnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition
import grails.plugin.springsecurity.SpringSecurityUtils

beans = {
    def conf = SpringSecurityUtils.securityConfig
    objectDefinitionSource(demo.PatchedAnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition) {
        application = ref('grailsApplication')
        grailsUrlConverter = ref('grailsUrlConverter')
        responseMimeTypesApi = ref('responseMimeTypesApi')
        boolean lowercase = conf.controllerAnnotations.lowercase
        if (conf.rejectIfNoRule instanceof Boolean) {
            rejectIfNoRule = conf.rejectIfNoRule
        }
    }

    // ... existing bean configuration ...
}
```

#### Security Config Type: Static Map

If using security configuration type `InterceptUrlMap`, edit the `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy` to include:

```
import demo.PatchedInterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition
import grails.plugin.springsecurity.SpringSecurityUtils

beans = {
    def conf = SpringSecurityUtils.securityConfig
    objectDefinitionSource(demo.PatchedInterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition) {
        if (conf.rejectIfNoRule instanceof Boolean) {
            rejectIfNoRule = conf.rejectIfNoRule
        }
    }

    // ... existing bean configuration ...
}
```

#### Security Config Type: Requestmap Instances

If using security configuration type `Requestmap`, edit the `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy` to include:

```
import demo.PatchedRequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition
import grails.plugin.springsecurity.SpringSecurityUtils

beans = {
    def conf = SpringSecurityUtils.securityConfig
    objectDefinitionSource(demo.PatchedRequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition) {
        if (conf.rejectIfNoRule instanceof Boolean) {
            rejectIfNoRule = conf.rejectIfNoRule
        }
    }

    // ... existing bean configuration ...
}
```
