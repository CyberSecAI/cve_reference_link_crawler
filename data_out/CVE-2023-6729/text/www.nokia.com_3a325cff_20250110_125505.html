# CVE-2023-6729 Nokia SR OS: File Access Security Vulnerability

| Public disclosure | 17-10-2024 |
| --- | --- |
| Last updated | 17-10-2024 |
| Vulnerability type | Incorrect Access Control |
| CVSS vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS score | 7.3 |

## Description

Nokia SR OS routers allow read-write access to the entire file system via SFTP or SCP for users configured with "access console." Consequently, a low privilege authenticated user with "access console" can read or replace the router configuration file as well as other files stored in the Compact Flash or SD card without using CLI commands. This type of attack can lead to a compromise or denial of service of the router after the system is rebooted.

## Affected products and versions

| Product | Versions |
| --- | --- |
| SR OS (7250 IXR, 7450 ESS, 7750 SR, 7950 IXR, VSR), 7705 SAR OS, 7210 SAS OS | All supported releases prior to Release 24 |

## Mitigation plan

Mitigations are available for software releases prior to release 24. Please contact Nokia support for details. Secure defaults are introduced in Release 24.
