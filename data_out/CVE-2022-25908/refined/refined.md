- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper user-input sanitization in the `devInstall` function of the `create-choo-electron` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-78). The `devInstall` function doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used. This can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `devInstall` function with malicious user input as a parameter. The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code that utilizes the vulnerable package and call the `devInstall` function. No special privileges are required (PR:N), no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
