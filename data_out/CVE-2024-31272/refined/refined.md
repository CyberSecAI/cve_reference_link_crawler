- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ARForms Form Builder Plugin for WordPress versions <= 1.6.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with their malicious request.
