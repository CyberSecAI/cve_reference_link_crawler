Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-4061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in Wildfly-core's management user Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permission system. Specifically, a management user with certain roles (like "Monitor") could use the `resolve-expression` function within the HAL interface to read system properties, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient RBAC permission control:** The management user roles "Monitor" (and similar) were granted broader access than intended, allowing them to access system properties.
- **Exposed system properties:** The `resolve-expression` function, when used in the HAL interface, inadvertently allows users to read sensitive data from the Wildfly system.
- **Lack of default sensitive information:** Although there is no sensitive information by default, the system's potential to store critical information like DNS, IP addresses, and credentials through the Wildfly Vault/Elytron subsystem exacerbates the vulnerability if not properly configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** A malicious user with a management account that has the vulnerable role could access the system and obtain potentially sensitive information.
- **Lateral movement:** Successful exploitation may allow a malicious user to gain a better understanding of the system's internal workings which can be used in other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker requires access to the management console using a user with a vulnerable role.
- The attacker uses the HAL interface and its `resolve-expression` function to read system properties.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Wildfly management console with a user account having a vulnerable role like "Monitor".
- Familiarity with the Wildfly HAL interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat considers this an "Important" security issue.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4.13.
-  It's recommended that Wildfly administrators utilize the Vault and Elytron subsystems for storing sensitive information.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wildfly Core version 15.0.30.Final.
