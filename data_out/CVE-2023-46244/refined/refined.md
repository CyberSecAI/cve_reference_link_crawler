Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way XWiki handles the display of document titles within the document tree macro and through the title displayer. Specifically:
*   **Document Tree Macro:** The document tree macro was setting the document's title, which changed the document's author to the author of the macro itself (XWiki.DocumentTreeMacros). This caused Velocity code in the title to execute with the macro's author's rights instead of the user's.
*   **Title Displayer:** The title displayer was using the original document as the context document when executing modified titles. This caused Velocity code within a document's title to be executed with the rights of the document's original author (likely a user with programming rights) rather than the user modifying the document. This allowed users with script rights to execute code with programming rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with only script rights could escalate their privileges to programming rights through the title displayer and the document tree macro. This is because the Velocity code inside the document title was being executed with the context of the original document or the macro, not the user trying to display it.
*   **Unintended Code Execution:** Velocity code within the document title was executed even when the user viewing the document did not have script rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Gaining Programming Rights:** Attackers could gain programming rights, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Data Access and Modification:** With programming rights, attackers could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   **System Compromise:**  Arbitrary code execution could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Document Tree Macro:** A user could create a document, set the document's title to a malicious Velocity expression, and then view it through the document tree macro.
*   **Title Displayer:** A user with script rights can create a document with a malicious velocity script in the title, which will execute with programming rights when the title is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Script Rights:** The attacker needs to have script rights to exploit the vulnerability, which allows them to use velocity scripts.
*   **Document Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit documents and set their titles.
*   **No User Interaction Required (Title Displayer):** The vulnerability using the title displayer does not require any specific user interaction to trigger.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the title is evaluated under the context of the current user, not the document's original author or macro author.
*   The issue was tracked as [XWIKI-20624](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624) (Privilege escalation through title displayer) and [XWIKI-20625](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20625) (Velocity execution in tree macro) in the XWiki Jira.
*   Patched versions: 14.10.7, 15.2-rc-1
*   The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-rmxw-c48h-2vf5.
*   The CVSS score is 9.1, with the vector string as CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a critical severity.
