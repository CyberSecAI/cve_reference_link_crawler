#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script right, create a document, e.g., named Nasty Title
2. Set the document's title to $request.requestURI
3. Click "Save & View"
4. Reload the page in the browser

**Expected result:**

A document named $request.requestURI is displayed in the navigation panel.

**Actual result:**

A document /xwiki/bin/get/Nasty%20Title/WebHome is displayed, showing that the Velocity code has been executed even though the user doesn't have script right.

This is because the document tree macro [sets the title](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/9a270960658c079edf684e3b08b42391e5bd4a98/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-index/xwiki-platform-index-tree/xwiki-platform-index-tree-macro/src/main/resources/XWiki/DocumentTreeMacros.xml#L360-L360) which changes the document's author to the author of XWiki.DocumentTreeMacros and thus the title is executed. It's only because of [~~XWIKI-20624~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624 "Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer") that the context document and author is unchanged during the actual execution of the title, once [~~XWIKI-20624~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624 "Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer") has been fixed this is an escalation to programming rights.

As long as [~~XWIKI-20624~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624 "Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer") hasn't been fixed, the context author is still the current user so any APIs that check author rights are safe. However, we have several privilege escalation vulnerabilities from script right and I can confirm that at least some of them can be exploited from this like XWIKI-19790 (requires admin interaction) or XWIKI-19858 (no interaction required), both allow gaining programming rights. I'm therefore still marking this as escalation attack as we can use features only available with script right.

# Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-rmxw-c48h-2vf5
Nov 7, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-display-api
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 3.2-milestone-3

## Patched versions

14.10.7, 15.2-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

It's possible for a user to write a script in which any velocity content is executed with the right of any other document content author.

To reproduce:

As a user with script but not programming right, create a document with the following content:

```
{{velocity}}
#set($main = $xwiki.getDocument('AppWithinMinutes.DynamicMessageTool'))
$main.setTitle('$doc.getDocument().getContentAuthor()')
$main.getPlainTitle()
{{/velocity}}

```

Since this API require programming right and the user does not have it, the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor` (not executed script), unfortunately with the security vulnerability we get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed with the right of the unmodified document.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds for it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

As a user with script but not programming right, create a document with the following content:

```
{{velocity}}
#set($main = $xwiki.getDocument('AppWithinMinutes.DynamicMessageTool'))
$main.setTitle('$doc.getDocument().getContentAuthor()')
$main.getPlainTitle()
{{/velocity}}

```

**Expected result:**

The string $doc.getDocument().getContentAuthor() is displayed as this call requires programming rights.

**Actual result:**

XWiki.superadmin or another author with programming rights is displayed.

This shows that a user with script right was able to access an API that requires programming rights because the context document's author is unchanged even though setTitle() has been called. This is because the [title displayer](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/9a270960658c079edf684e3b08b42391e5bd4a98/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-display/xwiki-platform-display-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/display/internal/AbstractDocumentTitleDisplayer.java#L252-L252) sets the original document as context document when executing the modified title.
