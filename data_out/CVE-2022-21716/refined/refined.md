  "CVE-2022-21716": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Twisted SSH client and server implementation naively accepted an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation when receiving the SSH version string, allowing an attacker to send an unlimited amount of data.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious peer can trivially craft a request that uses all available memory and crash the server, resulting in denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed over the network by sending a specially crafted SSH handshake request to the vulnerable service.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SSH server. No authentication is required."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Twisted SSH client and server implementation naively accepted an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation on the length of the SSH version string received during the handshake. This can lead to a buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can send a large amount of data as part of the SSH version identifier, leading to a denial of service on the affected server due to excessive memory consumption. The server can crash under this excessive memory pressure.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by connecting to the SSH service over a network and sending a malformed SSH handshake with an overly large version string.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any special privileges, only network access to the vulnerable service."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the Twisted SSH implementation's failure to limit the amount of data accepted for a peer's SSH version identifier.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and bounds checking on the size of the incoming SSH version identifier during the initial handshake, leading to excessive resource consumption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this weakness to exhaust server resources by sending an arbitrarily large amount of data as the SSH version string, causing a denial-of-service condition.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack occurs remotely by initiating an SSH connection with a crafted handshake containing an oversized SSH version identifier.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable SSH service. No authentication or special privileges are required."
