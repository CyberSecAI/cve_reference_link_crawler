4 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.
