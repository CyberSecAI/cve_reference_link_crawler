Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data in the `saveNewPwd.php` script of the `dingfanzu-CMS`. Specifically, the application fails to verify the type, length, and business parameter validity of user inputs, and does not filter special characters. This allows user-controlled data to be directly inserted into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because the username parameter in the `saveNewPwd.php` script is not sanitized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to various impacts, including:
  - **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information).
  - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, potentially disrupting the functionality of the application.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might gain elevated privileges within the application if user management is part of the database.
  - **System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain access to the underlying operating system via stored procedures or other advanced techniques.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `saveNewPwd.php` script.
- **Username Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `username` within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint (`/ajax/saveNewPwd.php`).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability as the username parameter is used during password reset functionality.
- The attacker needs to understand the basic structure of SQL queries to craft malicious inputs that will be executed in the database.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `saveNewPwd.php` file in the username parameter.
- The provided exploit uses the payload `username=1' or 1=1&pwd=1&pwd2=1` to test and confirm the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was tested on a Windows environment running Apache and MySQL.
