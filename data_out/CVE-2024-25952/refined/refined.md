- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the system's improper handling of UNIX symbolic links (symlinks).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system incorrectly follows symlinks, potentially leading to actions on unintended files or directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, potentially disrupting system operations. Additionally, it could allow for information tampering, where an attacker alters system data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have high privileges on the local system to exploit the vulnerability.
