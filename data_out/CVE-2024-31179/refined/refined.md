- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the `fluid_msg::of13::TableFeaturePropInstruction::unpack` routine in the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) libfluid (libfluid_msg module).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the affected component.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable component. No special privileges or user interaction are required.
