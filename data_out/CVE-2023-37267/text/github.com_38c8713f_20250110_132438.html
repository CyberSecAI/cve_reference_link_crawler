# Possible admin-level access to backoffice without authentication under rare conditions

High

[nikolajlauridsen](/nikolajlauridsen)
published
GHSA-h8wc-r4jh-mg7m
Jul 13, 2023

## Package

nuget

Umbraco.Cms
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

> 9.0.0

## Patched versions

10.6.1, 11.4.2, 12.0.1

## Description

Under rare conditions, a restart of Umbraco can allow unauthorized users to gain admin-level permissions.

#### Impact

An unauthorized user gaining admin-level access and permissions to the backoffice.

#### Patches

10.6.1, 11.4.2, 12.0.1

#### Workarounds

* Enabling the [Unattended Install](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/configuration/unattendedsettings) feature will mean the vulnerability is not exploitable.
* Enabling IP restrictions to `*/install/*` and `*/umbraco/*` will limit the exposure to allowed IP addresses.

#### Explanation of the vulnerability

We consider this issue a high-severity vulnerability as attackers may be able to temporarily make the configured database unavailable to Umbraco.

This is not a vulnerability in itself, but if Umbraco is restarted, while the database is unavailable, it will boot into installation mode.

When this happens, and the attacker successfully can re-establish the connection between Umbraco and the database, it will be possible to reset the admin credentials and then log in as an administrator.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
