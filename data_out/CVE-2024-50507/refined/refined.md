- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DS.DownloadList WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is unserialized, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable "POP chain" (a sequence of methods that call each other) is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and other attacks, depending on the available POP chain.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker by providing malicious serialized data to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
