* A chosen-plaintext attack against HTTP over TLS ("BREACH", CVE-2022-27221)
* Information disclosure vulnerabilities in the curl component (CVE-2021-22924 through -22925)
* Several vulnerabilities in the libexpat library, that could be exploited when the server is parsing untrusted XML files (CVE-2021-45960, CVE-2021-46143, CVE-2022-22822 through -22827, CVE-2022-23852, CVE-2022-23990, CVE-2022-25235 through -25236, CVE-2022-25313 through -25315.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEMA Remote Connect Server and recommends to update to the latest version. Note that the update also contains additional fixes for vulnerabilities documented in Siemens Security Advisories SSA-244969, SSA-539476, SSA-685781 and SSA-712929.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect Server.

Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take 'issuercert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case insensitively*, which could lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all, and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn't include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly when parsing the string provided by the application.

CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.
