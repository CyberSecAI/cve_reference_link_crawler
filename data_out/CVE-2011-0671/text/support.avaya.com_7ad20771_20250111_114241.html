Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as the recommended
update is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following link:
