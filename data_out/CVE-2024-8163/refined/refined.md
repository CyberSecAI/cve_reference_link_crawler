{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation when processing DELETE requests to the `admin/file_manager/files` interface, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path and filename to be deleted.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Deletion",
    "Path Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious DELETE request to the `admin/file_manager/files` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific privileges are mentioned but access to the admin panel or a similar authenticated interface might be required to make the request."
