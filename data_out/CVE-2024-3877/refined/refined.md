Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromqossetting` function of the Tenda F1202 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `fromqossetting` function takes a `qos` parameter from a POST request.
- The function uses `strcpy(dest, src)` to copy the user-supplied `qos` data into a destination buffer (`dest`).
- There is no size check on the `qos` parameter before copying, allowing a malicious user to supply a `qos` value that exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to:
    - Denial of service (DoS) due to program crash.
    - Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/fromqossetting` endpoint with an oversized `qos` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This likely requires the attacker to be on the same network as the router or have the ability to send requests to it through network access.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned, implying an unauthenticated attack is possible.
