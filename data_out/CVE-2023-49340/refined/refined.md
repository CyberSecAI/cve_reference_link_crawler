Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The web application uses a static, hardcoded session token (`Token: 12345678`) for authentication, which is not properly verified. This allows attackers to forge a cookie with any arbitrary value and gain access to the administrative portal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The system does not properly authenticate users, relying on a static, easily guessable token.
*   **Weak Authentication (CWE-1390):** The authentication mechanism is fundamentally weak due to the use of a static key-pair value for session management.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability leads to an access control issue where an unauthenticated user can gain administrative privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Authentication bypass:** An attacker can completely bypass the login process without needing valid credentials.
*   **Unauthorized access:** The attacker gains full access to the administrative portal.
*   **Privileged actions:** The attacker can execute privileged actions within the management portal, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based attack:** The attacker sends HTTP requests with a forged cookie to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the target device over the network.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and modify headers (specifically, the `Cookie` header).
*  **No prior authentication required:** The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated access.

**Additional details:**
*   The specific vulnerable product is the Newland NQuire 1000 Manta II Interactive Kiosk.
*   The tested firmware version is NQ1000-II\_G\_V1.00.011.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated with a simple HTTP request that includes a forged cookie.
*   The content provides a detailed proof of concept with HTTP request/response examples and screenshots, showing the successful bypass of authentication.
