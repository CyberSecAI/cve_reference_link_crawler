The provided content describes a path traversal vulnerability affecting multiple Flask-based Python projects.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `flask.send_file` with unsanitized, attacker-controlled input. Specifically, the `filename` parameter passed to `send_file` is directly derived from user input without sufficient validation. Additionally, the use of `os.path.join` to construct file paths before passing them to `flask.send_file` can be exploited with absolute paths, effectively bypassing the intended directory and leading to arbitrary file access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal, also known as directory traversal, vulnerability. Attackers can manipulate file paths using sequences like `../` or absolute file paths to access files outside of the intended web root directory.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input thatâ€™s used to construct file paths.
- **Insecure use of `os.path.join`**: The use of `os.path.join` without proper validation allows attackers to provide absolute paths, circumventing intended directory restrictions.
- **Insecure use of `flask.send_file`**: Directly using attacker controlled input with `flask.send_file` without proper sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server's file system, including sensitive application source code, configuration files, system files, and other critical data.
- **Potential Data Exposure:** Exposure of sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and other secrets.
- **Partial Denial of Service:** An attacker could make multiple requests to access large files, potentially leading to a denial of service state by consuming server resources. The impact of availability is considered low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests with malicious file paths to vulnerable endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication to the web application

**Additional Notes:**
The content provides details on how the vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL by Github, and it includes discussions on the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, the validity of CVEs for certain types of projects, and the limitations of SAST tools like LGTM.

The content includes multiple Proof of Concepts (PoC) using `curl` to demonstrate the exploit and recommends the following remediations:
- Using `flask.safe_join` to join paths instead of `os.path.join`.
- Replacing `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory`
-Preventing flow of untrusted data to `flask.send_file` calls
