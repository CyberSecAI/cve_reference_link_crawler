The provided content describes a vulnerability in OfficeWeb365, specifically an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the `/Pic/Indexs` interface.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `/Pic/Indexs` interface of OfficeWeb365. The application uses a custom encryption scheme that is not secure enough to prevent arbitrary file access by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary File Read: The application allows reading arbitrary files from the server by crafting a specific payload and encrypting it using a known method.
- Weak Encryption: The encryption scheme used is based on DES with a hardcoded key and IV, making it easy for an attacker to decrypt and encrypt payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of confidential data.
- System Instability: The ability to read arbitrary files can put the system in an insecure state.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the `/Pic/Indexs` endpoint. The `imgs` parameter contains the encrypted file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected OfficeWeb365 server.
- Knowledge of Encryption: The attacker needs knowledge of the DES encryption with specific hardcoded key and IV used by the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `/Pic/Indexs` interface.
- The `imgs` parameter in the URL is used to provide an encrypted file path to read.
- The encryption method uses a DES algorithm with the following key: `{ 102, 16, 93, 156, 78, 4, 218, 32 }` and IV: `{ 55, 103, 246, 79, 36, 99, 167, 3 }`.
- The plaintext file path is encrypted using the DES algorithm with the hardcoded key and IV, converted to Base64, and then appended with "09".
- The vulnerability affects versions 7.18.23.0 and 8.6.1.0 of OfficeWeb365.
- A sample exploit request is provided.
- The content includes a Nuclei script for automated detection.
