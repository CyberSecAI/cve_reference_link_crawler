{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A module reference leak occurs in the `ipoctal` driver. The driver takes a reference to the carrier module on every open call, but releases it only when the final reference to the tty struct is dropped. This leads to a module reference leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Module reference leak"
    ],
    "impact": "The module reference leak can cause the carrier module to not be unloaded when no longer needed. This can lead to resource exhaustion and may impact system stability.",
    "attack_vectors": "Opening and closing the tty device multiple times",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to open and close the tty device associated with the `ipoctal` driver."
