The provided content relates to CVE-2024-38373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the DNS response parser of FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP. The parser fails to properly validate the domain name length field in a DNS response, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-126: Buffer Over-Read

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause the DNS parser to read beyond the DNS response buffer by sending a crafted DNS response. This can potentially lead to denial of service or other undefined behavior. It could lead to a denial of service when the application attempts to read memory it should not be able to.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, specifically via crafted DNS responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to send crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP instance. This means the attacker should be on the same network or a position where they can intercept or influence the victim's DNS resolution process.
The attacker does not need to have privileges or user interaction is required, hence low attack complexity.
