{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient protection of account chooser activities against overlay attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper checks or mechanisms to prevent malicious overlays from interfering with the account chooser activities, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of user accounts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker with the capability to create and display overlays could potentially gain access to sensitive data by interfering with the account selection process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a local attacker using a malicious overlay that can be displayed over the legitimate account chooser activity.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to display an overlay on the device and have privileged access to execute the overlay."
