The provided content is related to a fix for a memory leak in the Linux kernel, specifically in the `memfd_pin_folios` function. It addresses a scenario where `free_huge_pages` were not restored correctly after unpinning folios that were not already faulted in. This issue occurs because the folio reference count, for pages created by `memfd_alloc_folio`, does not reach zero.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect reference counting mechanism in the `memfd_pin_folios` function when used with huge pages that have not been faulted in. The `folio_try_get()` within the `memfd_pin_folios` function increases the folio's reference count, but this is not undone correctly upon unpinning if the page wasn't previously faulted. This leads to a memory leak because the `free_huge_pages` are not released when expected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect reference counting on folios when using `memfd_pin_folios` with huge pages that have not been faulted in.
- Memory leak of `free_huge_pages` due to the unreleased folios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory leak that can potentially lead to resource exhaustion.
- System instability or denial of service if the memory leak is severe enough.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user can trigger the vulnerability by creating a memory file descriptor (memfd), allocating huge pages, pinning and unpinning these pages using `memfd_pin_folios` and `unpin_folios`, without faulting in those pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create memfds and call `memfd_pin_folios` and `unpin_folios` system calls. This is typically achievable by any user with local access.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix adds an extra `folio_put(folio)` call to correctly decrement the reference count and prevent the memory leak.
- The vulnerability is present in the code introduced by commit `89c1905d9c14` ("mm/gup: introduce memfd\_pin\_folios() for pinning memfd folios").
- The fix was introduced in commit `c56b6f3d801d7ec8965993342bdd9e2972b6cb8e`, and later backported in commit `59e081ff2e91bbf19b8c1ecb75b031f778858383`.
