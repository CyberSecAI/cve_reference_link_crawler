##### October 30, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-33626

##### SUMMARY

The LevelOne WBR-6012 router contains a vulnerability within its web application that allows unauthenticated disclosure of sensitive information, such as the WiFi WPS PIN, through a hidden page accessible by an HTTP request. Disclosure of this information could enable attackers to connect to the device’s WiFi network.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6

##### PRODUCT URLS

WBR-6012 - <https://us.level1.com/products/wbr-6012>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.3 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-200 - Information Exposure

##### DETAILS

The WBR-6012 is a wireless SOHO router. It is a low-cost device which functions as an internet gateway for homes and small offices while aiming to be easy to configure and operate. In addition to providing a WiFi access point, the device serves as a 4-port wired router and implements a variety of common SOHO router capabilities such as port forwarding, quality-of-service, web-based administration, a DHCP server, a basic DMZ, and UPnP capabilities.

The web page located at sysinfo.htm exposes sensitive information such as the WiFi WPS PIN, which is intended to be a “shared secret” and allows an attacker to connect to the WiFi network.

An example of the information included on sysinfo.htm is provided below:
