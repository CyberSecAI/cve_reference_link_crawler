Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-24203:

**CVE-2023-24203**

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied data, specifically the `company` and `query` parameters in the `get-quote.php` script. These parameters are directly incorporated into an SQL query to store the data in the database and later displayed without encoding.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is later executed in the browsers of users accessing the data.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The `company` and `query` parameters are not sanitized or encoded before being stored in the database and displayed in a web context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Malicious JavaScript can be used to steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the administrator.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Malicious code can redirect users to attacker-controlled websites.
    *   **Data theft:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information from the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Form Submission:** An attacker can submit a quote request form containing malicious JavaScript code in the `company` or `query` fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to submit data through the quote request form.
