Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-26899.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a deadlock scenario in the Linux kernel's block device handling. The `open_mutex` of a gendisk was used to protect both opening/closing of block devices and the creation of symlinks between holding disks and slave block devices in `bd_link_disk_holder()`. This dual use of the mutex led to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Mutex Usage:** The `open_mutex` was used for two distinct purposes: protecting block device open/close operations and protecting the symlink creation within `bd_link_disk_holder()`.
- **Deadlock Condition:** A deadlock could occur when one thread (T1) holds the `open_mutex` during operations like partition scanning, and another thread (T2) attempts to acquire the same mutex within `bd_link_disk_holder()` while adding a new disk to a RAID array. This happens when T2 has suspended all I/O operations, and T1 is waiting for the I/O to resume. This mutual dependency causes a deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Hang/Deadlock:** The primary impact is a system-wide deadlock, resulting in a complete system hang and denial of service. The system becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by operations involving block devices, such as partition scanning, and simultaneously adding or modifying RAID configurations. Specifically, the scenario involves concurrent operations on block devices and RAID array modifications where a thread is scanning partitions and another is adding a new device to the RAID array which uses `bd_link_disk_holder`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to trigger operations that can cause both partition scanning and modification of RAID devices simultaneously. This may require some level of system access or the ability to interact with block devices. A user with sufficient privileges to modify RAID configurations and interact with block devices can trigger this scenario.

The provided patches address the issue by introducing a new mutex, `blk_holder_mutex`, specifically for protecting operations within `bd_link_disk_holder()`, thereby separating the locking of symlink creation from the open/close protection using the original `open_mutex`.
