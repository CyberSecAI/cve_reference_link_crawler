- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `facebookConnect.php` script within the "Facebook" module (pkfacebook) for PrestaShop contains a vulnerable SQL call that does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). The `id` parameter in the `facebookConnect.php` script is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data (tokens) and unlock admin ajax scripts.
    - Hijack emails by rewriting SMTP settings.
    - Actively used to deploy a webskimmer to steal credit cards.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via HTTP requests to the vulnerable script (`facebookConnect.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code using a simple HTTP call.
