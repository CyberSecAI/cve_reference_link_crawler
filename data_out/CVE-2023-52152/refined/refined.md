The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in the `mupnp` library, specifically related to its HTTP server and URI parsing. These issues were discovered through fuzzing and include out-of-bounds reads, negative size memcpy calls, and crashes. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
*   **String Tokenizer:** The `mupnp_string_tokenizer_new` function calculates `lastPos` by subtracting 1 from the string length. If an empty string is provided, `strlen(value)` returns 0, causing a size\_t underflow when 1 is subtracted, resulting in a very large positive value for `lastPos`. This leads to out-of-bounds reads in `mupnp_string_tokenizer_nexttoken`.
*   **URI Parsing:** The `mupnp_net_uri_setvalue` function performs calculations on indexes which can result in negative values. These negative values are then passed to `mupnp_string_setnvalue`, which in turn can pass them to memcpy, which results in a negative size parameter being used, or other out-of-bounds reads. This happens due to lack of input sanitization. Specifically with the host and port processing within the URI parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** Occurs in the string tokenizer and when parsing the host part of the URI, when an IPv6 literal address is used (surrounded by []). This occurs when processing host and port from a URI string.
*   **Negative Size `memcpy`:**  Occurs within `mupnp_net_uri_setvalue` function when processing the user and port portion of a URI string, resulting from integer underflows from improper index calculations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crashes:** The vulnerabilities lead to crashes in the HTTP server and UPNP control point, which can result in denial-of-service conditions.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Out-of-bounds reads and writes can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected server, via a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network requests to the service. No other special access or privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided code diff shows the attempted fixes to the vulnerabilities.
*   The fuzzer crash reports provide call stacks pinpointing the exact location of the vulnerabilities.
*   The crashes are reproducible on Debian 12 and Void Linux with gcc 12.2.0.
*   The vulnerabilities are present both in the HTTP server and the UPNP control point of the library.
