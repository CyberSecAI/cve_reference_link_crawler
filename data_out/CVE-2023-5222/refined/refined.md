{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `isValidUser()` function in the `/ugw/httpd/html/cgi-bin/vitogate.cgi` binary contains hardcoded administrative credentials.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded credentials (usernames: 'vitomaster' and 'vitogate'; passwords: 'viessmann1917' and 'viessmann'). One of the accounts ('vitomaster') is hidden and cannot be removed or have its password changed through normal administrative interfaces.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Full access to the web management interface of the Vitogate 300 device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Web interface login page using the hardcoded credentials.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the device's web interface."
