- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WooCommerce PayPal Payments plugin <= 2.0.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions by leveraging the user's existing authentication. The impact varies depending on the specific actions that are vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute unintended actions on the user's behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged user into triggering a malicious request while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
