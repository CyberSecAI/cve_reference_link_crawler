- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key for SSLVPN cookie encryption within FortiOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded cryptographic key, which is a violation of secure coding practices. This falls under CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully retrieves this key can decrypt SSLVPN cookies potentially gaining unauthorized access or information. The impact is classified as "Information disclosure".
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves reverse engineering the FortiOS software to extract the hardcoded key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to obtain a copy of the vulnerable FortiOS firmware to perform reverse engineering.  No specific network position is mentioned beyond general access to the vulnerable device or its software.
