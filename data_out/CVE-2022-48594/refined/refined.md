Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the "ticket watchers email" feature of ScienceLogic SL1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application takes unsanitized user-controlled input.
- This unsanitized input is directly passed to a SQL query.
- This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. This can lead to:
   - Confidentiality breach (reading sensitive data)
   - Integrity violation (modifying or deleting data)
   - Availability impact (potentially crashing the database)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the "ticket watchers email" functionality of ScienceLogic SL1.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user-controllable input fields related to this feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account with "low privileges" (per CVSS metric PR:L) to access the vulnerable feature.
- No user interaction is required (per CVSS metric UI:N).
- The attack can be performed remotely over the network (per CVSS metric AV:N).

**Affected Products:**
- ScienceLogic SL1 versions up to and including 11.1.2 are affected.

**Additional Details:**
- The CVSS score is 8.8 (High) with vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- Vendor was notified on 09.06.2022 but initially refused disclosure.
