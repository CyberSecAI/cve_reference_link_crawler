Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-13380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly sanitize input within the SSL VPN portal during web page generation. Specifically, the error and message handling parameters are not sanitized. This allows the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious script is injected into parameters of the URL and then reflected back to the user. The vulnerable parameters include "error", "message", or "redir".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands within the user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, data exfiltration, defacement or potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via a network connection, making it accessible to attackers over the internet.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning no prior login or valid credentials are required to carry out the attack.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction because the crafted malicious URL needs to be accessed by the victim. This could happen by tricking the user into clicking a link in an email, or through other social engineering methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the FortiProxy or FortiOS device running the vulnerable SSL VPN portal. No prior authentication to the device is necessary.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript payloads injected into the vulnerable parameters (e.g., error, message, redir).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious crafted link.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **FortiProxy:**
    *   Version 2.0.0
*   **FortiOS:**
    *   6.0.0 to 6.0.4
    *   5.6.0 to 5.6.7
    *   5.4.0 to 5.4.12
    *   5.2 branch and below

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to the following versions or above, where the vulnerabilities have been addressed:
    *   FortiProxy: 2.0.1 or above or 1.2.9 or above
    *   FortiOS: 5.4.13, 5.6.8, 6.0.5 or 6.2.0 and above
*   **Workaround:** Disable the SSL VPN web portal if an upgrade is not immediately possible:
    *   For FortiOS 5.0 and below: `config vpn ssl settings` `set sslvpn-enable disable` `end`
    *   For FortiOS 5.2 and above: `config vpn ssl settings` `unset source-interface` `end`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Meh Chang and Orange Tsai from DEVCORE Security Research Team.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 4.6, which indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
