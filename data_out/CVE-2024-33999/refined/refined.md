{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The referrer URL used by MFA was not properly sanitized before being used, leading to potential security issues.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe direct use of the `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']` variable without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The provided text does not specify the exact impact, but the lack of sanitization could lead to various vulnerabilities, likely including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection-based attacks, as the referer header can be controlled by a malicious actor.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `HTTP_REFERER` header, which is controlled by the client/browser and can be manipulated by an attacker.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `HTTP_REFERER` header when accessing the vulnerable page."
