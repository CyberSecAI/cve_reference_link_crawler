The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42629.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF protection in FrogCMS V0.9.5 when editing pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists within the page editing functionality. Specifically, the `/admin/?/page/edit/10` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can perform actions on their behalf without their knowledge. In the given example, the attacker could modify the page content, potentially leading to:
- Content manipulation: Changing the title, slug, breadcrumb, description, and other attributes of a page.
- Modification of page parts: Modifying or removing existing page content or adding new content by manipulating the "part" data, effectively changing the page's content, layout, and functionality.
- Settings change: Modifying the status, layout, and other page settings.
- Potential injection of malicious code: Injecting JavaScript or other malicious content that could lead to further compromise of the application or other users.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page or link. The attacker hosts the malicious page and lures a logged-in user of FrogCMS to visit it. The page contains a form that is automatically submitted when the user accesses it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to:
1. Host or deliver a malicious HTML file
2. Lure a logged-in user to visit the malicious page in their browser

The user must be logged into their FrogCMS session at the time they are tricked into visiting the crafted malicious page.
