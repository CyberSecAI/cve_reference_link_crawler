Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `formSetCfm` function in Tenda FH1202 firmware is vulnerable to a stack overflow.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `funcpara1` parameter of the `formSetCfm` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `/goform/setcfm` endpoint, likely accessed via HTTP requests.
*   An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted request with an overly long `funcpara1` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This implies they need network access to the device, which could be on the local network or possibly from the internet if the device is exposed.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/setcfm`) and the vulnerable parameter (`funcpara1`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable firmware version is specifically Tenda FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408).
*   The vulnerability was initially reported on GitHub and then submitted to VulDB.
*   The VulDB entry ID is 258153.
