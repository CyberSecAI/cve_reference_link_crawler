Package        : unzip
Version        : 6.0-23+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-0529 CVE-2022-0530
Debian Bug     : 1010355

Sandipan Roy discovered two vulnerabilities in InfoZIP's unzip program,
a de-archiver for .zip files, which could result in denial of service
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
6.0-23+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.

For the detailed security status of unzip please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unzip>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
