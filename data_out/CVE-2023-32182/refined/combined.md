| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-05-08 11:36:55 UTC  ``` Noticed via systemd service monitoring. From /usr/lib/systemd/system/postfix.service, among others:  > ExecStartPre=/usr/lib/postfix/systemd/config_postfix  This runs /usr/sbin/config.postfix, a ~1.500 lines bash script.  In some locations safe temporary file / directions created via mktemp are used. The function `update_cf()` sticks out though:  ``` update_cf() {     while test "x$1" != "x" ; do         B=$( find /etc/postfix/${1} -printf %CY%Cm%Cd%CI%CM )         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "/var/adm/backup/postfix/${1}$B"         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "/var/adm/backup/postfix/${1}"         eval gen_${1/\./_} > /tmp/${1}.config         mv -Z /tmp/${1}.config /etc/postfix/${1};         shift     done } ```  This is e.g. invoked here:  ``` if test "$MAIL_CREATE_CONFIG" = "yes"; then         test -z "$r" && update_cf master.cf main.cf fi ```  But also via `restore_cf()` for main.cf and master.cf.  It looks like another local user can pre-create these files in e.g. /tmp/master.cf, wait for the script to overwrite it and then just in time replace the content again with something malicious so that the `mv -Z` actually moves a compromised script into place.  This requires a closer investigation still though. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-05-22 11:20:11 UTC  ``` I will look into this more closely. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-05-22 12:30:26 UTC  ``` The problematic code seems exploitable:  - symlink attack if protected_symlinks is off - otherwise allows to control the content of the postfix configuration  The code only runs the first time, though, or if var/adm/postfix.configured is not existing.  I will involved our package maintainers soon. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-05-22 12:52:55 UTC  ``` Assigning to you, Peter. Please see [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c0) and [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c2). There is a fixed /tmp file usage in `config.postfix` that can cause security issues.  Please check whether you can confirm it and prepare updates. We need updates for SLE first, don't publish the issue outside the company (or in OBS) until we have updates for SLE ready.  We will likely also assign one of our SUSE CNA CVEs, since this is a SUSE specific script. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2023-05-22 13:03:13 UTC  ``` I agree with Matthias' assessment. Please use CVE-2023-32182 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2023-07-05 12:22:00 UTC  ``` ping. Can you please have a look at this? Thanks ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c7)  Peter Varkoly   2023-07-06 11:45:23 UTC  ``` What about this solution? update_cf() {     while test "x$1" != "x" ; do         TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/postfix.${1}.XXXXXX) || exit 1         B=$( find /etc/postfix/${1} -printf %CY%Cm%Cd%CI%CM )         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "@conf_backup_dir@/${1}$B"         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "@conf_backup_dir@/${1}"         eval gen_${1/\./_} > $TMPFILE         mv -Z $TMPFILE /etc/postfix/${1};         shift     done } ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-07-11 10:35:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Peter Varkoly from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c7)) > What about this solution? > update_cf() { >     while test "x$1" != "x" ; do >         TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/postfix.${1}.XXXXXX) || exit 1 >         B=$( find /etc/postfix/${1} -printf %CY%Cm%Cd%CI%CM ) >         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "@conf_backup_dir@/${1}$B" >         cp /etc/postfix/${1} "@conf_backup_dir@/${1}" >         eval gen_${1/\./_} > $TMPFILE >         mv -Z $TMPFILE /etc/postfix/${1}; >         shift >     done > }  Yes, this should do, thank you. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1211196#c13)  Maintenance Automation   2023-08-23 20:30:39 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2023:3394-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one fix can now be installed.
