The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A double-free vulnerability exists in the `ns_update_nuse()` function of the NVMe host driver. The issue arises when `nvme_identify_ns()` fails. In this scenario, the `nvme_id_ns` structure is freed by `nvme_identify_ns()` before returning. However, `ns_update_nuse()` attempts to free the same structure again using `kfree()`, resulting in a double-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The double-free leads to a kernel crash. This can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by operations that cause `ns_update_nuse()` to be called and `nvme_identify_ns()` to fail. The content references `blktests nvme/045` as a test case.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the sysfs interface of nvme devices when trying to access the nuse attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the NVMe subsystem through sysfs or by triggering conditions that cause `ns_update_nuse()` to be called.
