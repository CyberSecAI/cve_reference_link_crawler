Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47830:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the misconfiguration of the `next.config.js` file, specifically within the `images.remotePatterns` section. The use of a `**` wildcard for the `hostname` allows the server to fetch images from any hostname.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The overly permissive hostname configuration enables an attacker to craft URLs that force the server to make requests to arbitrary external or internal locations. This is a classic SSRF vulnerability (CWE-918).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Request Execution:** An attacker can make the server perform GET requests to any URL, including internal resources.
- **Port Scanning:** By making requests to various ports on internal hosts, attackers can perform port scanning to identify open services.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information might be leaked through responses obtained from the server's requests, although the provided information does not specifically confirm this.
- **Denial of Service:** Repeated SSRF requests can lead to denial of service by overloading internal resources or external services, although this is not explicitly mentioned as the primary impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL that points to the `/_\next/image` endpoint, embedding a target URL for the server to fetch.
- The server then makes a GET request to the target URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** No specific user privileges or authentication is needed for exploitation.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack requires no user interaction beyond crafting a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to have network access to send crafted requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions `<= v0.22-dev` of the `plane` project and is fixed in version `v0.23`.
- The provided CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.3 (Critical).
- The `plane` application uses Next.js.
- A similar vulnerability (GHSA-j77v-w36v-63v6) is referenced as having a similar impact (port scanning).
- A reference to an article on digging for SSRF in Next.js apps is provided.
