- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiWLC admin web UI does not sanitize user-controlled input in the "refresh" and "branchtotable" parameters of HTTP POST requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands in the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious URL crafted by the attacker, which, when visited by an authenticated user with an open session on the WebUI, can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and convince an authenticated user with an open session on the vulnerable FortiWLC WebUI to visit it.
