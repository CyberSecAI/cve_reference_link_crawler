- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a CSRF attack to exploit the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but a higher privileged user would need to be.
