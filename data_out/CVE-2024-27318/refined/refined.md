```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `external_data` field of the tensor proto in onnx package can have a path to a file outside the model's current directory or user-provided directory. This allows an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal (CWE-22)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system. It can also potentially lead to writing arbitrary files and code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the `external_data` field with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences, variations, or absolute file paths.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or influence the path specified in the `external_data` field within an ONNX model file. The attacker doesn't require any prior access to the system."
