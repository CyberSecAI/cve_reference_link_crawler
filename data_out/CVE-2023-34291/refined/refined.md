- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B or X_T files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious X_B or X_T file or visits a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious X_B or X_T file or a malicious web page. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
