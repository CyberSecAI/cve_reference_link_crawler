  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Tenda AC7V1.0 Vx.x.x.x firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is located in the `formQuickIndex` function and is triggered by a crafted request containing an overly long `PPPOEPassword` parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the `/goform/QuickIndex` endpoint, which likely means the attacker needs network access to the device. The ability to control the length of the `PPPOEPassword` parameter is also necessary for triggering the overflow."
