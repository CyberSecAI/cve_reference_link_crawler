The provided content relates to CVE-2023-46116.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tutanota desktop application insufficiently sanitizes URLs before passing them to `shell.openExternal`, which opens the URL in the user's default browser. While it blocks `file:` URLs, it fails to block other potentially harmful schemes like `ftp:`, `smb:`, etc.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient URL sanitization
- Use of `shell.openExternal` with user-controlled input
- Improper input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the victim's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can send a specially crafted email containing a malicious hyperlink using schemes such as `ftp:`, `smb:`, `ms-msdt:`, `search-ms:` etc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
- No special privileges are required. The attacker only needs to trick the user into clicking the malicious link.
- The attacker needs to host a file on a server reachable by the victim, in the provided PoC it is an FTP server.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the vulnerability on a Ubuntu XFCE desktop environment and a video PoC. The patch for this vulnerability is also described which introduces a warning dialog for suspicious URLs that are not `http:` or `https:`.
