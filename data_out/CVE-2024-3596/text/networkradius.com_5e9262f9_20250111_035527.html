# BlastRADIUS Resource Hub

Upgrade the World

## We fixed BlastRADIUS

All RADIUS vendors have used our [vendor guide](/web/content/2557?unique=47be02c8aed46c53b0765db185320249ad873d95) to upgrade their products. These changes will be added to the RADIUS standards, and mandated as new behavior for all RADIUS implementations.

For everyone else who has questions about the issue, we have a [FAQ.](/blastradius/faq)

We have developed a comprehensive set of documentation and verification tools which help ISPs, Telcos, and enterprises  to protect themselves from the BlastRADIUS vulnerability.

Use our tools to upgrade your systems quickly, efficiently, and with minimal risk.

## Our BlastRADIUS product suite

### BlastRADIUS upgrade guide and worksheet

This document and accompanying Excel spreadsheet explains exactly which steps to take, and in what order.  Even better, it explains
*why* to take these steps, and
*how* to verify that the systems are working correctly at each step. It is **vendor neutral**, and will help you upgrade  RADIUS clients and servers from any vendor.

Don't create "ad hoc" local solutions based on an incomplete understanding of the issue. Instead, follow the guide created by the experts who solved the issue.

It is provided as a "zip" download.
