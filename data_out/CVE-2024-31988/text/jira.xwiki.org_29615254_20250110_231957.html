#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or admin right create a comment or any other content that is viewed by admins that includes the following image [[image:path:/xwiki/bin/get/RTFrontend/ConvertHTML?wiki=xwiki&space=Main&page=WebHome&text=%7B%7Bvelocity%7D%7D%24logtool.error%28%22Hello%20from%20Velocity%20%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fvelocity%7D%7D]]. Optionally, position the image outside the view by, e.g., using a negative margin.
2. As admin, see that comment.

**Expected result:**

Nothing happens.

**Actual result:**

The error "Hello from Velocity!" gets logged.

This demonstrates a CSRF vulnerability in the realtime HTML Convertor API that allows remote code execution. Any logged-in user can embed Velocity scripts or Groovy programs in any content they have write access to, that will be executed whenever a user with the necessary rights browses the content. Having an admin click the link through other means doesn't even require an account.
