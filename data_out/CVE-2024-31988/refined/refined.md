  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-31988",
    "description": "The XWiki Platform is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks via the Realtime HTML Converter API. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by tricking an administrator into clicking a crafted link or viewing content with a malicious URL.  This could lead to a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation.",
    "affected_versions": ">= 13.9-rc-1, < 14.10.19, >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.4, >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.9",
    "patched_versions": "14.10.19, 15.5.4, 15.9",
    "root_cause": "The Realtime HTML Converter API (RTFrontend.ConvertHTML) did not validate CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to make requests on behalf of a logged-in user, specifically an admin with programming rights.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary remote code execution, leading to complete compromise of the XWiki installation (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).",
    "attack_vectors": "Network. An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in administrator to visit it, or inject it into content viewed by an administrator. The vulnerability can be exploited through a GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs or inject content. No specific privileges are required. The attacker needs to trick a user with programming rights into interacting with the malicious content or URL.",
     "cvss": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",
     "remediation": "Apply the patch that introduces CSRF token validation to the RTFrontend.ConvertHTML API. Alternatively, upgrade to a patched version of XWiki."
