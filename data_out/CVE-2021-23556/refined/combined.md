| **Describe the bug**  We understand that the usability of `-e` option. ([#720](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/720)) BTW, it must not be exposured in d-bus interfaces.  **Expected behavior**  guake must not exposure execute\_command in d-bus interfaces.  *Do not exposure execute\_command in d-bus interface.*  **Actual behavior**  guake exposure execute\_command in d-bus interface.  **To Reproduce**  We can use gdbus to call an execute\_command d-bus method.  ``` $ gdbus call -e -d org.guake3.RemoteControl -o /org/guake3/RemoteControl -m org.guake3.RemoteControl.execute_command "id > /tmp/1234" $ cat /tmp/1234 uid=1000(juno) gid=1000(juno) groups=1000(juno),4(adm),20(dialout),21(fax),24(cdrom),25(floppy),26(tape),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),100(users),109(netdev),112(bluetooth),115(lpadmin),117(scanner)  ```  ---   ``` juno@abcd:/tmp/p/$ guake --support Usage: guake [options]  guake: error: no such option: --support   ```  cc.

| Hi, it is nice, that you fix a potential security issue, but is there any concept for keeping the `-e` option working without the dbus call? I use this option at a few places and would like to know now, if this option is going to be supported in the future or if i have to find another method for implementing my use cases. |

Fix arbitrary execution via dbus security flaw

```
Highlighted in [#1796](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1796). Also removed comments that won't be true or relevant with this change. These changes orphan the execute_command_by_uuid() method, but the method can probably still be used elsewhere.

#### Introduced: 27 Jan 2022

[CVE-2021-23556  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23556) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-749  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/749.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `guake` to version 3.8.5 or higher.

## Overview

[guake](https://pypi.org/project/guake) is a Guake Terminal

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Exposed Dangerous Method or Function due to the exposure of `execute_command` and `execute_command_by_uuid` methods via the `d-bus` interface, which makes it possible for a malicious user to run an arbitrary command via the d-bus method.

**Note:**
Exploitation requires the user to have installed another malicious program that will be able to send dbus signals or run terminal commands.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

Highlighted in and fixes [#1796](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1796). Also removed comments that won't be true or relevant with this change. These changes orphan the `execute_command_by_uuid()` method, but the method can probably still be used elsewhere, maybe given a command line flag like what `execute_command()` has.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[3.8.1](/Guake/guake/releases/tag/3.8.1)

3.8.1 is a bugfix release mainly targeting a major regression in keyboard shortcuts, though it also comes with some minor added features and updates. More bugfix updates are in the works to resolve other less pressing issues that didn't get addressed in this release.

In other news, an officially endorsed PPA is in the works for Guake as an upcoming alternative method to install Guake. Watch this space for updates.

### Release Summary

Added line height and character width adjustment options

Fix keybinding regressions

Lazy focus loss to avoid closing on short-term losses

Moved guake.desktop.metainfo.xml to $datadir

### New Features

* + Feature request: Setting line-spacing / line-height [#849](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/849)
* + Support of short term focus loss and avoid folding [#1643](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1643)

### Bug Fixes

* + Some shortcut keys are abnormal [#1939](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1939)

### Notes for Package Maintainers

* Glade layout file upgraded with 3.38.2 from last used 3.22.2, should still be valid but some things may be deprecated/renamed.
* guake.desktop.metainfo.xml has been moved to $datadir in Makefile

[3.8.0](/Guake/guake/releases/tag/3.8.0)

This has been a long time since the latest official releases. More than one year without real update, unfortunately. I have pretty much stepped back on the role of maintainer, linux isn't my main development environment anymore, and Guake is so linked with the GTK system I cannot debug or do anything without having to start a VM.

[@Davidy22](https://github.com/Davidy22) and [@mlouielu](https://github.com/mlouielu) have started taking care of Guake and they are helping a lot on the boring duties of the package maintainance: ticket triage, bugfixes, preparing releases...

Discussion about this release has been opened [here](https://github.com/Guake/guake/discussions/1927).

There have been lot of minor changes and bug fixes it is not easy to summaries in one sentence, but here is the automatically generated changelog.

## Release Summary

Adds Shades of Purple Theme

Default to the system theme, make having guake deviate be optional.

Add copy on select option to copy to regular clipboard

Add close tab to d-bus interface.

Fix ignored "Show scrollbar" after spliting vertically

  attempting to maximize the window.
* Re-implemented the refocus functionality.

  This functionality allows the user to return the focus to an open guake window.

  The functionality was revived, partially based on commented-out code found in Guake.show\_hide().
* Bring back GUAKE\_TAB\_UUID

## Known Issues

* + removes the broken feature, where double-clicking on the tab bar opened a new tab [#1439](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1439)

    desired, users may need to uncheck "Use system default theme" in

  org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved to is user executable if guake is installed in

  userspace so that guake can compile and create gschemas.compiled.

  If the destination for org.guake.gschema.xml cannot be user executable, make sure to

  include:

  glib-compile-schemas [schema directory]

  In the installation script, replacing [schema directory] with the place

  org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved.
