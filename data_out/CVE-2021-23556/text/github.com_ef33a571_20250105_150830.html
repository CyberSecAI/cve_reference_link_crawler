[3.8.1](/Guake/guake/releases/tag/3.8.1)

3.8.1 is a bugfix release mainly targeting a major regression in keyboard shortcuts, though it also comes with some minor added features and updates. More bugfix updates are in the works to resolve other less pressing issues that didn't get addressed in this release.

In other news, an officially endorsed PPA is in the works for Guake as an upcoming alternative method to install Guake. Watch this space for updates.

### Release Summary

Added line height and character width adjustment options

Fix keybinding regressions

Lazy focus loss to avoid closing on short-term losses

Moved guake.desktop.metainfo.xml to $datadir

### New Features

* + Feature request: Setting line-spacing / line-height [#849](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/849)
* + Support of short term focus loss and avoid folding [#1643](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1643)

### Bug Fixes

* + Some shortcut keys are abnormal [#1939](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1939)

### Notes for Package Maintainers

* Glade layout file upgraded with 3.38.2 from last used 3.22.2, should still be valid but some things may be deprecated/renamed.
* guake.desktop.metainfo.xml has been moved to $datadir in Makefile

[3.8.0](/Guake/guake/releases/tag/3.8.0)

This has been a long time since the latest official releases. More than one year without real update, unfortunately. I have pretty much stepped back on the role of maintainer, linux isn't my main development environment anymore, and Guake is so linked with the GTK system I cannot debug or do anything without having to start a VM.

[@Davidy22](https://github.com/Davidy22) and [@mlouielu](https://github.com/mlouielu) have started taking care of Guake and they are helping a lot on the boring duties of the package maintainance: ticket triage, bugfixes, preparing releases...

Discussion about this release has been opened [here](https://github.com/Guake/guake/discussions/1927).

There have been lot of minor changes and bug fixes it is not easy to summaries in one sentence, but here is the automatically generated changelog.

## Release Summary

Adds "Galizur" Theme

Adds Shades of Purple Theme

Default to the system theme, make having guake deviate be optional.

Add copy on select option to copy to regular clipboard

Color Palettes: Fix "Gruvbox Dark" & Add "Gruvbox Material Dark"

Add support for tabs in keyboard shortcuts

placing the appstream metainfo file in the right path according to <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#spec-component-location>

Automatically hide the tab bar when there is only one tab

Add close tab to d-bus interface.

Fix ignored "Show scrollbar" after spliting vertically

Fix missing or malformed schema files when upgrading guake

Move window to correct coordinates before maximizing

Fixes prompting when closing a tab.

Fix right click menu not populating when custom commands is malformed

Fix trailing punctuation in URLs being included in the URL

* Move the window to the correct coordinates, in the correct display, before

  attempting to maximize the window.
* Re-implemented the refocus functionality.

  This functionality allows the user to return the focus to an open guake window.

  It happened to be partially be maintained but faced issues in the migration to Gtk3.

  The functionality was revived, partially based on commented-out code found in Guake.show\_hide().
* Bring back GUAKE\_TAB\_UUID

## Known Issues

* + removes the broken feature, where double-clicking on the tab bar opened a new tab [#1439](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1439)

    desired, users may need to uncheck "Use system default theme" in

    properties->general

## Notes for Package Maintainers

* Add close tab to d-bus interface.
* Should resolve issues with the gschemas.compiled file. Make sure that the location

  org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved to is user executable if guake is installed in

  userspace so that guake can compile and create gschemas.compiled.

  If the destination for org.guake.gschema.xml cannot be user executable, make sure to

  include:

  glib-compile-schemas [schema directory]

  In the installation script, replacing [schema directory] with the place

  org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved.
