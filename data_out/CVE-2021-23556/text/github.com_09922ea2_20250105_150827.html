| **Describe the bug**  We understand that the usability of `-e` option. ([#720](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/720)) BTW, it must not be exposured in d-bus interfaces.  **Expected behavior**  guake must not exposure execute\_command in d-bus interfaces.  *Do not exposure execute\_command in d-bus interface.*  **Actual behavior**  guake exposure execute\_command in d-bus interface.  **To Reproduce**  We can use gdbus to call an execute\_command d-bus method.  ``` $ gdbus call -e -d org.guake3.RemoteControl -o /org/guake3/RemoteControl -m org.guake3.RemoteControl.execute_command "id > /tmp/1234" $ cat /tmp/1234 uid=1000(juno) gid=1000(juno) groups=1000(juno),4(adm),20(dialout),21(fax),24(cdrom),25(floppy),26(tape),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),100(users),109(netdev),112(bluetooth),115(lpadmin),117(scanner)  ```  ---   ``` juno@abcd:/tmp/p/$ guake --support Usage: guake [options]  guake: error: no such option: --support   ```  cc.

| Hi, it is nice, that you fix a potential security issue, but is there any concept for keeping the `-e` option working without the dbus call? I use this option at a few places and would like to know now, if this option is going to be supported in the future or if i have to find another method for implementing my use cases. |
