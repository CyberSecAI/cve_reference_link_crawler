Highlighted in and fixes [#1796](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1796). Also removed comments that won't be true or relevant with this change. These changes orphan the `execute_command_by_uuid()` method, but the method can probably still be used elsewhere, maybe given a command line flag like what `execute_command()` has.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@gsemet](https://github.com/gsemet), it really doesn't look like the pull request hook works the way you said it does. Looks a lot to me like CI isn't being run on pull requests. |
