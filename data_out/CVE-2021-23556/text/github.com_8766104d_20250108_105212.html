Fix arbitrary execution via dbus security flaw

```
Highlighted in [#1796](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1796). Also removed comments that won't be true or relevant with this change. These changes orphan the execute_command_by_uuid() method, but the method can probably still be used elsewhere.
