## Required Configuration for Exploitation

CVE-2023-3646 Is tracked by BUG829136. In order to be vulnerable to the CVE a system must already be impacted by BUG765111, which is a non CVE known issue. In order to be impacted by BUG765111, the following conditions must be met:

Mirroring to multiple destinations must be configured:

```
switch(config)#show monitor session

Session s1
------------------------

Sources:

Both Interfaces:        Et1/1

Destination Ports:

    Et9/1 :  active
    Et10/1 :  active

```

In the above example two destinations, Et9/1 and Et10/1, are configured.

Mirroring config must be added with mirror destination being ethernet port, example:

```
switch # show running-config | section monitor
monitor session APCON destination Ethernet54/1

```

In the above example the argument after destination is an Ethernet port.

## Indicators of Compromise

This vulnerability may lead to a kernel panic and cause system reload.

The following kernel message would appear in the output of “**show reload cause**” or the kernelcrash log (i.e. /mnt/flash/debug/kernelcrash.last, this requires bash access) which indicates the issue:

```

The above log lines indicate that sand-dma caused a kernel panic. These logs will be present after reboot.

To determine if BUG765111 is impacting the system:
 Run the following CLI command:

```
#platform fap <fapName> diag dump chg ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE 0 1

```

If neither "**PRP\_CONTEXT\_PORT\_PROFILE=1" nor "FWD\_CODE\_PORT\_PROFILE=2"** are present then BUG765111 is impacting the system and it is possible for CVE-2023-3646 to occur.

Example of a system **not** impacted by BUG765111:

```
#platform fap Fap0 diag dump chg ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE 0 1
Fap0 diag dump chg ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE 0 1:
ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE.ETPPA0[0]: <PRP_CONTEXT_PORT_PROFILE=1,PORT_EM_ACC_CMD=8,LLVP_PROFILE=1,FWD_CODE_PORT_PROFILE=2,ECC=0x28,>

```

Example of a system impacted by BUG765111:

```
#platform fap Fap0 diag dump chg ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE 0 1
Fap0 diag dump chg ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE 0 1:
ETPPA_PER_PORT_TABLE.ETPPA0[0]: <PORT_EM_ACC_CMD=8,LLVP_PROFILE=1,ECC=0x2b,>

```

Here **PRP\_CONTEXT\_PORT\_PROFILE=1** and **FWD\_CODE\_PORT\_PROFILE=2** are **not** present which indicates the system is impacted by BUG765111.

## Mitigation

The suggestion to prevent this issue is to remove any mirroring config

```
#show monitor session
No sessions created

```

This example confirms that the system does not have any mirroring config present which will prevent this issue from occurring.

## Resolution

The recommended resolution is to upgrade to a remediated software version at your earliest convenience. Arista recommends customers move to the latest version of each release that contains all the fixes listed below.
For more information about upgrading see [EOS User Manual: Upgrades and Downgrades](/en/um-eos/eos-upgrades-and-downgrades)

CVE-2023-3646 has been fixed in the following releases:

* 4.28.6M and later releases in the 4.28.x train
* 4.29.2F and later releases in the 4.29.x train

### Hotfix

The following hotfix can be applied to remediate CVE-2023-3646. The hotfix only applies to the releases listed below and no other releases. All other versions require upgrading to a release containing the fix (as listed above):

* 4.28.2F through 4.28.5.1M releases in the 4.28.x train
* 4.29.1F and earlier releases in the 4.29.X train

Note: Installing/uninstalling the Hotfix will result in a restart of the SandFapNi agent and an associated reprogramming of the switch chip. This process could result in outages from 5-20 minutes, depending on the number of active ports in the particular system.

To determine which hotfix to use, run “**show version**” from the CLI and refer to the “Architecture” Field.
