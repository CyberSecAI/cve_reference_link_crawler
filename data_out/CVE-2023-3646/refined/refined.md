- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read in the `fab_sand_hdrinfo` function within the `sand_dma` module, triggered by a specific configuration involving multiple mirroring destinations. This occurs after the system is already impacted by another bug (BUG765111).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
    - Kernel panic resulting from the read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A kernel panic leading to a system reload (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by an internal system error when mirroring to multiple destinations is configured.
    - Specifically, this occurs when mirroring is configured to an ethernet port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker does not directly trigger the bug. However, the system must have mirroring configured to multiple destinations and be impacted by BUG765111 which is a known non-CVE issue.
    - The attacker does not require any privileges or interaction with the system. The vulnerability is triggered by an internal error once the vulnerable configuration exists on the device.
