- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FortiWeb due to insufficient bounds checking when handling request parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can overwrite the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests with large request parameter values
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable FortiWeb server. No authentication is required.
