| A heap buffer overflow occurs when makeswf parse a invalid swf file, and the filename extension is `.swf`. Test Environment Ubuntu 20.04, 64 bit libming (master [04aee52](https://github.com/libming/libming/commit/04aee52363688426eab74f5d6180c149654a6473)) Steps to reproduce  1. compile libming with ASAN  ``` $ CC="clang -fsanitize=address,fuzzer-no-link -g" CFLAGS+=" -fcommon" ./configure  $ make  ```  2. Download the poc file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marsman1996/pocs/master/libming/poc-makeswf-04aee52-r_readc-HBO.swf) and run cmd    `$ makeswf $POC`  ASAN report ``` $ ./bin_asan/bin/makeswf ./poc-makeswf-04aee52-r_readc-HBO.swf Output file name: out.swf Output compression level: 9 Output SWF version: 6 ================================================================= ==5625==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60800000013f at pc 0x0000004f15b5 bp 0x7fff376560d0 sp 0x7fff376560c8 WRITE of size 1 at 0x60800000013f thread T0     #0 0x4f15b4 in r_readc /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:264:34     #1 0x4f1a37 in getbits /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:143:18     #2 0x4f1656 in rect /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:169:9     #3 0x4efe15 in openswf /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:303:2     #4 0x4eedbe in newSWFPrebuiltClip_fromInput /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:1302:8     #5 0x4cbea3 in embed_swf /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/util/makeswf.c:699:14     #6 0x4ca4d9 in main /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/util/makeswf.c:401:4     #7 0x7f0aa6b3d83f in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-S7Ft5T/glibc-2.23/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:291     #8 0x41c5a8 in _start (/opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/bin_asan/bin/makeswf+0x41c5a8)  0x60800000013f is located 199 bytes to the right of 88-byte region [0x608000000020,0x608000000078) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x4975fd in malloc /local/mnt/workspace/bcain_clang_vm-bcain-aus_3184/final/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:145:3     #1 0x4ef8d8 in openswf /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:271:41     #2 0x4eedbe in newSWFPrebuiltClip_fromInput /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:1302:8     #3 0x4cbea3 in embed_swf /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/util/makeswf.c:699:14     #4 0x4ca4d9 in main /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/util/makeswf.c:401:4     #5 0x7f0aa6b3d83f in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-S7Ft5T/glibc-2.23/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:291  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /opt/disk/marsman/libming/04aee52/build_asan/src/blocks/fromswf.c:264:34 in r_readc Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c107fff7fd0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c107fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c107fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c107fff8000: fa fa fa fa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 fa   0x0c107fff8010: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa =>0x0c107fff8020: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa[fa]fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c107fff8030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c107fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c107fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c107fff8060: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c107fff8070: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==5625==ABORTING  ``` |
