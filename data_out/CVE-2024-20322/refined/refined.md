- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper assignment of lookup keys to internal interface contexts during ACL processing on Pseudowire (PW) interfaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of lookup keys for internal interface contexts, leading to a bypass of configured ACLs on PW interfaces in the ingress direction.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured ACLs, potentially granting access to resources that were meant to be protected. The overall impact depends on the specific network setup and the importance of the protected resources.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by sending traffic through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send traffic through a vulnerable device, and does not need to be authenticated. They must be able to reach the affected PW interface.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the root cause as an improper assignment of lookup keys and also specifies which interfaces are vulnerable. It also describes how to check if your device is vulnerable.
