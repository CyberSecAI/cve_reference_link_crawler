Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formApPortalWebAuth` function of Tenda i22 V1.0.0.3(4687) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formApPortalWebAuth` function copies the `webUserName`, `webUserPassword` and `data` parameters from a POST request directly to stack variables using `strcpy` or `sprintf` without proper bounds checking. This allows for overflowing the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing a remote attacker to gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to `/goform/apPortalAuth`.
- The attacker needs to control the contents of `webUserName`, `webUserPassword` and `data` parameters in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned in the exploit.
