{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `col` parameter of the GET request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service. The specific example shows the ability to determine the current database user.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request",
      "URL Parameter Manipulation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication was mentioned as required in this case to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The issue was initially reported on August 25, 2020 and the provided payload was extractvalue(1,concat(char(126),(select/\*\*/current\_user()))). The vulnerable parameter is ‘col’. The fix seems to revolve around preventing DB SQL error messages from being displayed which should fix this issue on a production server, instead of fixing the underlying issue."
