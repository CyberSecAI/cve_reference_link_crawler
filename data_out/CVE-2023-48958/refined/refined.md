Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `gf_mpd_resolve_url` function within the `media_tools/mpd.c` file of the GPAC library. Specifically, the `strdup` function allocates memory without proper deallocation in the vulnerable code path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is the failure to free allocated memory using `strdup`. This leads to a gradual consumption of memory, which, if left unchecked, can exhaust system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting available memory and potentially crashing the application.
- **Application Instability:** The leak can cause the application to become unstable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed DASH manifest. Specifically, when resolving URLs within an MPD file, the vulnerable function is called.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted DASH manifest (`.mpd` file) that triggers the vulnerable code path within MP4Box/GPAC.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network, the crafted mpd file can be loaded locally.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `gf_mpd_resolve_url` at `media_tools/mpd.c:4589`.
- The memory leak occurs due to a failure to free memory allocated by `strdup`.
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log confirms a leak of 50 bytes in 1 allocation.

**Affected Version:**
- GPAC version 2.3-DEV-rev617-g671976fcc-master

**Solution:**
- The vulnerability has been fixed in a later commit. The provided links show the fix has been integrated into a later version of GPAC.
- Users are advised to update GPAC to a more recent version, or the commit referencing the fix.
