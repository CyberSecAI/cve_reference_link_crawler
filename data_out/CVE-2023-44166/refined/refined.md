Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44166:

**Summary:**

*   The content directly relates to CVE-2023-44166, providing details on the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation for the 'age' parameter in the `process_registration.php` script of the "Online Movie Ticket Booking System v1.0".
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  Unauthenticated SQL injection. The 'age' parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sanitization or proper escaping, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breach (reading sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    *   Complete system compromise by injecting malicious code via SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote via the web application. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `age` parameter during the registration process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special access is required; the attacker can be unauthenticated and needs only access to the web application to send a crafted HTTP request to `process_registration.php` with a malicious `age` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
session_start();
include('config.php');
extract($_POST);
mysqli_query($con,"insert into  tbl_registration values(NULL,'$name','$email','$phone','$age','gender')");
```

The vulnerability lies in directly using the `$age` variable from the `$_POST` array in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in "Online Movie Ticket Booking System v1.0".
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   Exploit is available.
*   The vendor is Projectworlds.
*   There is no patch available at the time of the advisory.
