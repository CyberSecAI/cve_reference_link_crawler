The provided content directly references CVE-2024-1285 and provides details about a vulnerability in the "Page Builder Sandwich" WordPress plugin, which aligns with the CVE description of "Implement CVE description retrieval".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** within the `gambit_builder_save_content` function of the Page Builder Sandwich plugin. This function is responsible for saving content changes made through the page builder interface.
   - The plugin fails to verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to edit the specific post they are attempting to modify.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of capability checks before saving post content.
   - **Insecure direct object reference:** The `post_id` can be manipulated to allow the user to edit content of other posts they don't have access to.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Post Editing:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the content of any existing post on the WordPress site. This means they can inject malicious scripts, deface pages, or manipulate information visible to site visitors.

   - **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account with subscriber-level or higher privileges on the targeted WordPress site.
   - **Direct POST request:** The attacker can craft a POST request to `wp_ajax_gambit_builder_save_content` containing the modified post data and the `post_id` of the target post to be modified.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site. Subscriber role or higher is sufficient.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
