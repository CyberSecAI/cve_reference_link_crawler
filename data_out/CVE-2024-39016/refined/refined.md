- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `assign` and `set` functions in the `@c3/utils-1` package are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerable functions do not properly handle the `__proto__` property, allowing an attacker to modify the built-in `Object.prototype`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype, leading to potential denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks. The specific impact depends on the gadgets present in the application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker calls the vulnerable functions (`assign` or `set`) with an argument containing the `__proto__` property.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable functions `assign` or `set` with attacker-controlled input.
