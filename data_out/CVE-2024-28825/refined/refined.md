- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The brute-force protection mechanism was not implemented for all login methods, specifically REST API and basic authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete implementation of brute-force protection, allowing attackers to bypass account lockout mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could brute-force user passwords without triggering account lockouts, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks using REST API or basic authentication login methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the Checkmk system via the network. No user privileges are required to initiate an attack.
