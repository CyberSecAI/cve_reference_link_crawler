The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25073.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The baseband software does not properly check a pointer specified by the CC (Call Control module).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Untrusted pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is in the baseband software, which is a low-level software component that manages the modem and radio communication. The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves the CC module passing an unchecked pointer to another part of the software that causes a crash when dereferenced.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send data to the baseband processor to trigger the vulnerability. This likely involves gaining access to the cellular network interface.

**Affected Products:**
Exynos 9820, Exynos 9825, Exynos 980, Exynos 990, Exynos 850, Exynos 1080, Exynos 2100, Exynos 2200, Exynos 1280, Exynos 1380, Exynos 1330, Exynos 9110, Exynos W920, Exynos W930, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300
