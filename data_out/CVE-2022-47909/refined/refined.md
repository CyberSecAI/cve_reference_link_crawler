Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-47909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of sanitization of the `force_authuser` GET parameter within the `ajax_graph_images.py` endpoint. This parameter is directly inserted into the `AuthUser` header of Livestatus queries. The vulnerability is further enabled by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the agent-receiver, which allows an attacker to bypass the localhost restriction of the affected endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Line Feed Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject line feed characters (newline characters, `\n` or `0x0a`) into the LQL query via the `force_authuser` parameter. This enables the attacker to insert arbitrary LQL headers.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `force_authuser` parameter before using it in the LQL query, allowing for the injection.
*   **SSRF Bypass:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely because of the SSRF in the agent-receiver which can be used to access the `/ajax_graph_images.py` endpoint that is normally restricted to localhost.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary LQL Queries:** By injecting line feed characters, attackers can insert arbitrary LQL headers and queries. This ability allows attackers to potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the monitoring core.
    *   Modify data within the monitoring core.
    *   Potentially execute commands on the server if the LQL interface has such capabilities.
*   **Further Exploitation:** This vulnerability serves as a stepping stone for a larger exploit chain that ultimately leads to remote code execution (RCE). By forging LQL queries, an attacker can delete arbitrary files and bypass authentication mechanisms in the NagVis component.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote via SSRF:** The attacker exploits the SSRF vulnerability in the agent-receiver by sending a crafted request to `/register_with_hostname` with a manipulated `host_name` parameter. This SSRF is used to access the vulnerable `ajax_graph_images.py` endpoint, which is normally restricted to localhost.
*   **Manipulated GET Parameter:** The attacker crafts a GET request to the `/ajax_graph_images.py` endpoint via the SSRF, including a malicious payload in the `force_authuser` parameter. This payload uses line feed characters to inject arbitrary headers and commands into the LQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Checkmk server's agent-receiver (TCP port 8000).
*   **Understanding of LQL:** The attacker needs an understanding of the Livestatus Query Language (LQL) to craft effective malicious queries.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability Chain:** The attacker needs to understand that the `/ajax_graph_images.py` endpoint can be exploited using the SSRF and the `force_authuser` parameter to form the correct attack.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists because the `force_authuser` parameter was not being sanitized before insertion into the AuthUser header.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable when chained with an SSRF vulnerability in the agent receiver.
*   The attacker can inject arbitrary LQL queries.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing the `force_authuser` input and preventing line feed characters injection.
*   The provided content provides more context and technical detail than the original CVE description.

The vulnerability is rated as CVSS 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L.
