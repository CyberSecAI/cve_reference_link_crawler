Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-42070:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Doc objects within the PDF-XChange Editor. This lack of validation can cause a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory, which can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory.
- Remote code execution: Although this vulnerability on its own does not cause remote code execution, the advisory mentions that it can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when handling specially crafted Doc objects. This implies an attack vector that relies on a malicious file or webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or webpage containing the specially crafted Doc object.
- User interaction is required, meaning the user needs to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
