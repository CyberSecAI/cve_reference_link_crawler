Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application, SecurAccess, when in debug mode, stores emergency credentials in plaintext within log files.
*   These log files are located in a DEBUG folder which is accessible to anyone.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The most critical weakness is the storage of credentials in plaintext. This is a significant security risk.
*   **Insecure Log Access:**  The DEBUG folder, where the logs are stored, is accessible to "anyone," indicating a lack of access controls or an overly permissive configuration.
*   **Debug Mode Misuse:** The vulnerability is triggered by enabling debug mode and using the application for RDP connections, meaning that debug mode is not properly secured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers who gain access to the debug logs can obtain plaintext emergency credentials. This could provide unauthorized access to systems protected by SecurAccess.
*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:** With access to these credentials, attackers could potentially move laterally within a network to compromise other systems and resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The impact could be higher if the emergency credentials have elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Access:** Attackers need local file access to the system where SecurAccess is installed, specifically to the DEBUG folder.
*   **Social engineering:** It is possible that an attacker can convince a user to enable debug mode or that a user can accidentally enable debug mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local filesystem of the machine where SecurAccess is installed. This could be an attacker with compromised credentials or an insider.
*   **Knowledge of DEBUG folder location:** The attacker needs to know where the DEBUG folder is located to find the logs.
* **Knowledge of SecurAccess**: The attacker needs to know how to trigger debug mode with the application and use it for RDP connections.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to SecurAccess version 9.3.502.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5, indicating a medium severity.
*   No patches are known at the time of the advisory.
*   The advisory timeline shows the vulnerability was discovered in October 2018, with public disclosure in January 2019.
