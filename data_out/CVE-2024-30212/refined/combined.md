### **Known Issues**

The current known issues are as follows:

* ATSAMA5D2C and SAM9X60 example applications build with a warning message: `Warning[Pe111]: statement is unreachable for return ( EXIT_FAILURE ); statement of main() in IAR`
* The Console system service API signatures (and behavior) have changed but the Macros used to print console and debug messages remain unchanged.
* When using MPLABx to program/debug SAMA5D27C projects

  + "Run project" feature is not supported. Clicking on the "Run Project" button will not run the application on the target board.
  + "Step out" feature is not supported. Clicking on the "Step Out" button (or pressing Ctrl + F7) while debugging an application will not move the program counter.
* SYS\_FS\_DriveFormat API signature has changed with the latest Fat-FS code. Existing applications/middle-wares using the API with the latest Fat-FS, will need to update to the new API signature. An MHC option is provided to use the older version of Fat-FS code
* SYS\_FS\_FSTAT structure has been modified to align with latest Fat-Fs code. For getting large file names applications/middlewares need to use fname parameter instead of lfname. Below are the affected API's

  + SYS\_FS\_FileStat
  + SYS\_FS\_DirRead
  + SYS\_FS\_DirSearch
* Updating File System based applications created with Harmony Core v3.6.x for PIC32MZ devices to Harmony Core v3.7.x will require removing and adding the File System component in the MHC Project Graph
