{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing user accounts. Specifically, the 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Username' fields are vulnerable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions when an admin views the user list page or otherwise interacts with the injected data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the malicious script within the 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Username' parameters when creating or editing a user account.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires administrative access to the system to create or edit user accounts. They must be able to navigate to the user management page."
