- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected product, Siveillance Control, does not properly check the list of access groups assigned to a user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization (CWE-863). Specifically, the system fails to properly enforce access control lists related to user groups.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A locally logged-on user can gain write privileges for objects for which they should only have read privileges. This allows the user to modify data or configurations that should be protected.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a locally logged-on user of the Siveillance Control system. They do not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
