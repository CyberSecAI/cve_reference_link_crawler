- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Configuration credentials are not encrypted and are stored in system memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Sensitive configuration credentials are kept in an unencrypted form.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive configuration credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to system memory could potentially read the unencrypted configuration credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would require the ability to access the system's memory to read the unencrypted credentials.
