{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `TEE_MACUpdate`, `TEE_MACComputeFinal` and `TEE_CipherUpdate` functions within the Samsung mTower TEE OS. These functions take a size argument (chunkSize, messageLen, srcLen) from the trusted application (TA) without validating if it corresponds to the actual size of the provided data buffer. This lack of validation leads to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer access with incorrect length value in `TEE_MACUpdate`",
    "Buffer access with incorrect length value in `TEE_MACComputeFinal`",
    "Buffer access with incorrect length value in `TEE_CipherUpdate`",
    "Lack of input validation for size parameters from TA in TEE OS functions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing an excessively large value for `chunkSize`, `messageLen`, or `srcLen` in the vulnerable functions, leading to a crash in the trusted execution environment (TEE) kernel.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by invoking the vulnerable functions (`TEE_MACUpdate`, `TEE_MACComputeFinal`, `TEE_CipherUpdate`) from a trusted application (TA) and passing an excessive size value for the respective parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a trusted application (TA) that can call the vulnerable TEE OS functions."
