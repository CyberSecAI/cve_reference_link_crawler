December 30, 2022(Update: What is wrong with this app, simply will not connect to warp, only 1.1.1.1) After last 2 update 90% of the time "failed to connect" to warp. Only 1.1.1.1 works but some of my apps will only work on warp and vis-versa. It is becoming more and more frustrating. I have cleared cache, reinstalled, followed all cloudflare tutorials. Simply fails to connect.

December 12, 2024Untill the latest version it was working smoothly. I'm using this for almost a year, and highly recommended it to other fellows. But with the latest version we are having some issues like YouTube is again marked as always excluded, and we cannot remove it. I urge the developers of warp to kindly solve the issue so that we can use the app smoothly. Thank you.1,190 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUlZOtKm_tqfqRlf1NXo9_HNOjR81wlvCnlg3paLK8XzOKQWXom=s32-rw)Sbusiso Nkabinde*more\_vert*

December 18, 2024Cloudflare Warp is hands down the best free VPN and DNS service in the world! The app is super easy to use, and it provides a lightning-fast connection without compromising on security. I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement in my internet speed and stability while using Warp, even when accessing content internationally. Unlike other VPNs, Warp doesn‚Äôt slow down your device‚Äîit optimizes your connection while keeping your data private and secure.535 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
