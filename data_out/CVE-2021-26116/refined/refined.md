- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within the command line interpreter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78). The CLI of FortiAuthenticator does not properly sanitize user-provided input used as arguments to existing commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can inject malicious OS commands by crafting special arguments to existing commands via the command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials and be authenticated to the FortiAuthenticator system with high privileges to access the CLI.
