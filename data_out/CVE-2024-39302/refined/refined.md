The provided content relates to CVE-2024-39302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect file permissions were set for files within the `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/resque-2.6.0` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Overly elevated file permissions in the specified directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker may exploit the elevated file permissions to achieve privilege escalation and potentially expose sensitive information on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attack, likely requiring some level of access to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have network access to the server and some means of exploiting the incorrect file permissions. The CVSS score indicates no privileges required, which implies the attacker does not need any prior access or specific account on the system, but that is only in the context of the base score. The high complexity indicates that the attacker would still need to craft a specific exploit to take advantage of this vulnerability

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects BigBlueButton versions prior to 2.7.8.
- Patches were released for versions 2.6.18, 2.7.8, and 3.0.0-alpha.7.
- The fix involves setting the correct file permissions for the resque files.
- Workarounds include manually changing the file permissions to match the patch.
