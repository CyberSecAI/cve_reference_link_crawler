Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `CmsTemplateAdminController#savePlace` method and the `CmsFileUtils#createFile` method. The application directly concatenates the user-supplied filename with the file content without any filtering or sanitization. This leads to an arbitrary file upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided filename and content.
*   **Path Traversal:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to upload files without validation can also lead to path traversal if the application does not validate the path component of the provided filename, allowing an attacker to write files in arbitrary locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a JSP, PHP, or HTML file containing JavaScript) an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. In this case, the attacker uploads an HTML file containing javascript, which is then accessible from the webserver.
*   **Data Breach/Defacement:** The attacker could potentially overwrite existing files, upload malicious scripts, deface the website, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):** The uploaded HTML file with javascript can be used for XSS attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/cmsTemplate/savePlace` endpoint.
*   **Form Data:** The malicious filename and content are submitted as form data within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin in the application to access the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server to send the malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The `CmsTemplateAdminController#savePlace` method directly concatenates the user-provided filename and content after prepending "include" to the name.

2.  The `CmsFileUtils#createFile` method creates the file on the server without any validation or sanitization, allowing the attacker to control the final file path and content.

3.  The provided POC shows the attacker submitting a POST request to `/admin/cmsTemplate/savePlace` with form data for the file path and content, with the content containing a JavaScript alert. This demonstrates the ability to inject malicious content into the server file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability affects versions of PublicCMS <= V4.0.202302.e
*   The issue is marked as closed in the repository.
