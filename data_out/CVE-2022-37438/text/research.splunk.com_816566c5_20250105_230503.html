# Detection: Splunk Account Discovery Drilldown Dashboard Disclosure

**EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION**

This detection status is set to experimental. The Splunk Threat Research team has not yet fully tested, simulated, or built comprehensive datasets for this detection. As such, this analytic is not officially supported. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at research@splunk.com.

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: f844c3f6-fd99-43a2-ba24-93e35fe84be6
Author: Marissa Bower, Rod Soto, Splunk
[Type: TTP](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies the presence of environment variables in Splunk dashboard drilldown URLs. It uses the REST API to query dashboards for specific patterns in the XML data. This activity is significant because it can expose sensitive tokens from privileged users if an attacker shares a malicious dashboard. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to detokenize variables and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or escalate privileges within the Splunk environment.

### Search

```

2| rest splunk_server=local /servicesNS/-/-/data/ui/views
3| search eai:data="*$env:*" eai:data="*url*" eai:data="*options*"
4| rename author AS Author eai:acl.sharing AS Permissions eai:appName AS App eai:data AS "Dashboard XML"
5| fields Author Permissions App "Dashboard XML"
6| `splunk_account_discovery_drilldown_dashboard_disclosure_filter`

```
### Data Source

No data sources specified for this detection.

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| splunk\_account\_discovery\_drilldown\_dashboard\_disclosure\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_account_discovery_drilldown_dashboard_disclosure_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Notable | Yes |
| Rule Title | `%name%` |
| Rule Description | `%description%` |
| Notable Event Fields | user, dest |
| Creates Risk Event | True |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type TTP. These detections will use Risk Based Alerting and generate Notable Events.
### Implementation

This search uses REST function to query for dashboards with environment variables present in URL options.

### Known False Positives

This search may reveal non malicious URLs with environment variables used in organizations.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential exposure of environment variables from url embedded in dashboard | 40 | 50 | 80 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
