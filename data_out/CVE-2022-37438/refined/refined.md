Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Splunk Enterprise handles environment variables within dashboard drilldown URLs. Specifically, an authenticated user can create a dashboard that includes environment variables in the drilldown URLs. When another user interacts with the drilldown, these variables can potentially expose sensitive information related to other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The primary vulnerability is the potential leakage of sensitive information, such as usernames, email addresses, and real names of Splunk users, through exposed environment variables in dashboard drilldown URLs.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the environment variables used in drilldown URLs, allowing them to potentially leak sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Information:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information about other Splunk users.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:**  While not directly stated, the information disclosure could be a stepping stone for further attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation if leaked tokens are used maliciously.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Dashboard Creation:**  An attacker with the ability to create and share dashboards can craft a malicious dashboard that includes environment variables in drilldown URLs.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when another user interacts with the drilldown links within the malicious dashboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated Splunk user with the ability to create and share dashboards.
- **Social Engineering (Implied):** The attacker would need to entice another user to view the malicious dashboard and interact with the drilldown link.

**Additional Details:**
- **Mitigation:**  The vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring permissions for dashboards and the knowledge objects that drive them.
- **Detection:**  Splunk has provided a specific search query to detect potentially malicious dashboards.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS score of 2.6 (Low) is assigned, with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N indicating a remote attack requiring user interaction and a low privilege level, with limited impact on confidentiality but no impact on integrity or availability. However, the advisory mentions that if the Splunk Enterprise instance disabled Splunk Web, it is not impacted, and the vulnerability is informational.
- **Affected Versions:** Splunk Enterprise versions 8.1.10 and lower, 8.2.0 to 8.2.7 and 9.0.0 are affected.
