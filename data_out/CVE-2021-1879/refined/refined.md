Based on the provided content, here's the information about CVE-2021-1879:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper management of object lifetimes within WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free issue due to inadequate object lifetime management in WebKit, leading to a universal cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to universal cross-site scripting (UXSS). This could enable attackers to steal sensitive information, manipulate user sessions, and perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves processing maliciously crafted web content, which suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious website or through injecting malicious code into a legitimate website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to deliver or host a website with malicious web content that can trigger the vulnerability in WebKit. No specific position within the network is mentioned, suggesting it's a client-side vulnerability where the victim needs to browse to the malicious content.
