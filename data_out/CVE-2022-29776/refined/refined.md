        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `Read` function within the `CxFile` class, specifically when handling file reading with start and end limits. The `clamp_buffer` function, intended to prevent out-of-bounds reads, fails to properly constrain the buffer, leading to potential heap buffer overflows if the `size` is not validated against available buffer space.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Heap buffer overflow",
          "Missing bounds check"
        ],
        "impact": "Heap buffer overflow could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure.",
        "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted image files (BMP, etc.) that exploit the lack of proper buffer clamping during file read operations.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted file that is processed by the vulnerable code. No special privileges are needed."
