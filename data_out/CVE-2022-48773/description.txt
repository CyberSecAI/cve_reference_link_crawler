In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xprtrdma: fix pointer derefs in error cases of rpcrdma_ep_create

If there are failures then we must not leave the non-NULL pointers with
the error value, otherwise `rpcrdma_ep_destroy` gets confused and tries
free them, resulting in an Oops.
