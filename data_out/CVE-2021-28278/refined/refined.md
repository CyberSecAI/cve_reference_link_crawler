Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28278:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `RemoveSectionType` function within `jpgfile.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `memmove` operation within the `RemoveSectionType` function attempts to move a block of memory that exceeds the allocated buffer's boundaries. This is triggered when processing a crafted JPEG file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As evidenced by the AddressSanitizer report, the heap-based buffer overflow leads to a crash of the application. This can effectively cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JPEG file:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted JPEG file designed to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JPEG file to the vulnerable application for processing. This could be achieved through various means, such as uploading the file or processing it through a vulnerable function in a different system.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer during a fuzzing process.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `a50953a`.
- The specific file that triggers the vulnerability is `tests_61786.jpg` and can be found within `tests_61786.zip`
- The overflow occurs because `RemoveSectionType` attempts to `memmove` memory past allocated buffer.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory identifies this vulnerability as "low" severity, but it is remotely exploitable.
