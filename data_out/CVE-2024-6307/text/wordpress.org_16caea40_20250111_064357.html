# WordPress 6.5.5

---

## WordPress 6.5.5 is now available!

This release features three security fixes. Because this is a security release, **it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.** This minor release also includes [3 bug fixes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?component=!Build%2FTest+Tools&milestone=6.5.5&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=component&order=priority) in Core.

You can [download WordPress 6.5.5 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.5.5.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”. If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

WordPress 6.5.5 is a short-cycle release. The next major release will be version 6.6 which is scheduled for July 16, 2024.

For more information on WordPress 6.5.5, please visit the [HelpHub site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-5-5/).

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for [responsibly reporting vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/wordpress?type=team), and allowing them to be fixed in this release:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the HTML API reported by Dennis Snell of the WordPress Core Team, along with Alex Concha and Grzegorz (Greg) Ziółkowski of the WordPress security team.
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Template Part block reported independently by Rafie Muhammad of Patchstack and during a third party security audit.
* A path traversal issue affecting sites hosted on Windows reported independently by Rafie M & Edouard L of Patchstack, David Fifield, [x89](https://hackerone.com/x89), [apple502j](https://hackerone.com/apple502j), and [mishre](https://hackerone.com/mishre).

## Thank you to these WordPress contributors
