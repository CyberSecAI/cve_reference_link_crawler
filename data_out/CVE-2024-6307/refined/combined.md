### Description

WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the HTML API in various versions prior to 6.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

# WordPress 6.5.5

---

## WordPress 6.5.5 is now available!

This release features three security fixes. Because this is a security release, **it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.** This minor release also includes [3 bug fixes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?component=!Build%2FTest+Tools&milestone=6.5.5&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=component&order=priority) in Core.

You can [download WordPress 6.5.5 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.5.5.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”. If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

WordPress 6.5.5 is a short-cycle release. The next major release will be version 6.6 which is scheduled for July 16, 2024.

For more information on WordPress 6.5.5, please visit the [HelpHub site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-5-5/).

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for [responsibly reporting vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/wordpress?type=team), and allowing them to be fixed in this release:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the HTML API reported by Dennis Snell of the WordPress Core Team, along with Alex Concha and Grzegorz (Greg) Ziółkowski of the WordPress security team.
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Template Part block reported independently by Rafie Muhammad of Patchstack and during a third party security audit.
