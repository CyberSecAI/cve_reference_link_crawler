- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `Http_handle` object using the `stat` method, which interprets relative paths without proper sanitization. This allows path traversal using `../`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal vulnerability due to the lack of validation on file paths passed to the `stat` method. Specifically, the lack of checks for relative paths (e.g., `../`) and file extensions, and the absence of private/public path classification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary file read, allowing attackers to access sensitive system files both within and outside the intended web context (`/etc_ro/web/`). This includes private data and potentially configuration files.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a manipulated file path including `../` sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, an attacker only needs network access to the device to send HTTP requests.
