Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input validation within the administrative web application's API. Specifically, the `callMainFunction` in `CoreAPI.php` allows authenticated users to call arbitrary PHP functions with arbitrary arguments passed via POST parameters. While there is a check to block certain dangerous functions, functions in the `cfgUtil.php` file, such as `cfgUtilShellExecSudo`, are not included in this block list. These functions allow execution of operating system commands with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `method` and `args` parameters received in POST requests.
*   **Missing Blocked Function Check:** The `cfgUtilCheckMethod` function does not include dangerous functions provided by cfgUtil.php, specifically those that can execute shell commands as root, like `cfgUtilShellExecSudo`.
*   **Insecure Function Usage:** Functions like `cfgUtilShellExecSudo` are used to execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected system with root privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The ability to execute commands as root allows an attacker to take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP POST requests to the administrative web application's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to access the administrative web application, although a low-privileged "ReadOnly" role is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web application through the network.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint and the vulnerable functions to exploit the vulnerability.
