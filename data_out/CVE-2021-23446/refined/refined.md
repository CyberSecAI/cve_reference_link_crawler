Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used in the `Handsontable.helper.isNumeric` function. This regex is inefficient and susceptible to catastrophic backtracking when processing certain inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The regex is vulnerable to ReDoS due to its structure, which allows for excessive backtracking when a crafted input is provided, specifically long strings without numbers like an empty string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition by providing malicious input. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, making the system unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send malicious input strings to the `Handsontable.helper.isNumeric` function, causing the vulnerable regular expression to consume excessive resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They only need to be able to send input data to the affected component of the application. The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable regex was used to check if a value is numeric.
*   The issue manifests when the regex is tested against a long string that does not match, for example a very long string with only spaces or an empty string. The regex engine tries many combinations, leading to "catastrophic backtracking" and significant CPU usage.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated with test case `Handsontable.helper.isNumeric(' '.repeat(100000));` showing a significant performance difference between the vulnerable and fixed code.
*   The fix involves optimizing the regular expression to prevent excessive backtracking.

**Affected versions:**

The following versions of the `handsontable` package are affected:

*   `handsontable` (NuGet): versions `[0.11.4,10.0.0)`
*   `handsontable` (npm): versions `>=0.23.0 <10.0.0`
*  `org.webjars:handsontable` (Maven): versions `[0.12.4,]`
*   `org.webjars.bowergithub.handsontable:handsontable` (Maven): versions `[0.28.4,]`
*   `org.webjars.npm:handsontable` (Maven): versions `[,14.3.0)`
*   `org.webjars.bower:handsontable` (Maven): versions `[0.17.0,]`

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading to `handsontable` version 10.0.0 or higher, which includes an optimized version of the regular expression.
*   For the Maven packages there are no fixes available other than upgrading the `handsontable` dependency if possible.
