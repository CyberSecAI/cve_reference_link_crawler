- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `exportProduct::_addDataToDb()` method in the "Product Catalog (CSV, Excel, XML) Export PRO" module for PrestaShop contains sensitive SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters. Specifically, the `id_task` parameter from the HTTP request is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The code directly uses user-provided input within SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP calls. A guest user can trigger the vulnerability with a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required. An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious HTTP request to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
