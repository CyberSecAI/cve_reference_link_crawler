| When a logged-in user clicks on a specially crafted link with a `redirect_url` parameter, the user can be redirected to an external website. The user must take an action, such as clicking on a portal button or using the browser’s back button, to trigger the redirection. This could lead to phishing attacks, where an attacker tricks users into visiting a malicious website by crafting a convincing URL.   1. When logged-in, a victim clicks on the link: <https://portal.caddysecurity.network/auth/whoami?redirect_url=https://nvmgpc54pak47d02e6a1l6c6wx2oqfo3d.oastify.com> 2. Then, he clicks on the `Portal` button. He is redirected to the redirect\_url through this request:  ``` GET /auth/portal HTTP/2 Host: portal.caddysecurity.network Cookie: AUTHP_SESSION_ID=REDACTED; access_token=REDACTED; AUTHP_REDIRECT_URL=https://nvmgpc54pak47d02e6a1l6c6wx2oqfo3d.oastify.com Sec-Ch-Ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="115", "Chromium";v="115" Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0 Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "macOS" Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Referer: https://portal.caddysecurity.network/auth/whoami?redirect_url=https://nvmgpc54pak47d02e6a1l6c6wx2oqfo3d.oastify.com Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,pl;q=0.8,ru;q=0.7 ```  ``` HTTP/2 303 See Other Cache-Control: no-store Location: https://nvmgpc54pak47d02e6a1l6c6wx2oqfo3d.oastify.com Pragma: no-cache Server: Fly/a0b91024 (2023-06-13) Set-Cookie: AUTHP_REDIRECT_URL=delete; Domain=caddysecurity.network; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 12:49:01 GMT Content-Length: 0 ```  When he uses arrows in the browser to come back to the authorization process, he can be redirected to the external domain by this request too:  ``` GET /oauth2/google/authorization-code-callback?state=fad54088-4e3f-452b-bcdc-db409c64a703&code=4%sdfdsf-sdfsdfsdf&scope=email+profile+openid+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&authuser=0&hd=caddysecurity.com&prompt=none HTTP/2 Host: portal.caddysecurity.network Cookie: AUTHP_SESSION_ID=g36v1Ycxjb1bHcBJ3FK1C2xqUb1rLpeawaN0Nglf1bLk; AUTHP_REDIRECT_URL=https://l9ve3aj238y2lbe0s4ozz4q4avgm4lsa.oastify.com Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7 Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Ch-Ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="115", "Chromium";v="115" Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0 Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "macOS" Referer: https://portal.caddysecurity.network/ Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,pl;q=0.8,ru;q=0.7 ```  ``` HTTP/2 303 See Other Authorization: Bearer ABC.REDACTED.REDACTED Cache-Control: no-store Location: https://l9ve3aj238y2lbe0s4ozz4q4avgm4lsa.oastify.com Pragma: no-cache Server: Fly/a0b91024 (2023-06-13) Set-Cookie: access_token=eyREDACTED; Domain=caddysecurity.network; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; Set-Cookie: AUTHP_SANDBOX_ID=delete; Domain=caddysecurity.network; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Set-Cookie: AUTHP_REDIRECT_URL=delete; Domain=caddysecurity.network; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 12:38:53 GMT Content-Length: 0 ```  To mitigate this vulnerability, perform proper redirect\_url parameter validation to ensure that the redirection URLs are allowed only within the same domain or from trusted sources.  In addition, we also recommend the following long-term fixes:   * Implement robust unit tests with different bypassing scenarios of redirect\_url parameter validation. Refer to the potential [URL Format Bypasses](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/url-format-bypass). Keep in mind that different components can use different URI parsers, which can lead to [parsing confusion](https://snyk.io/blog/url-confusion-vulnerabilities/). * Use Burp Suite Professional with a scanner with both these settings enabled:   + Audit coverage – maximum: to use the most extensive set of payload variations and insertion point options   + Audit coverage – thorough: to try more payload variations   More information about our Caddy Security public disclosure:   * <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/> |

| [@greenpau](https://github.com/greenpau) I tried adding `trust logout redirect uri domain myhost path /` to my `authentication portal`, but `https://myhost/auth?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmalicoushost.com%2F` still redirects to the other host. Am I doing something wrong? |
