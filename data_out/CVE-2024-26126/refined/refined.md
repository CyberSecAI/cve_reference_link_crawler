- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is categorized as Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). This means that the software does not properly validate user-supplied input, leading to potential security issues.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could result in a security feature bypass, potentially allowing an attacker to circumvent security measures within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user (PR:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The scope is unchanged (S:U), and the impact is limited to low integrity (I:L) without affecting confidentiality or availability.
