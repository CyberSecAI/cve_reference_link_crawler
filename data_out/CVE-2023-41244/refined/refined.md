- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Localize Remote Images Plugin <= 1.0.9 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated. The specific impact will vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin, where a malicious actor crafts a request that will be executed when a higher privileged user visits a malicious page while logged in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into visiting a malicious page or performing a malicious action on a page controlled by the attacker. The attacker needs no prior authentication on the affected website.
