The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28725. It describes multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in YZMCMS v7.0.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data in various parts of the YZMCMS application. The application fails to properly neutralize or sanitize the user-supplied input when it is stored in the database and then later rendered on the web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The content details multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities:
1. **Ads Management:**
   -  When editing an ad and selecting HTML as the ad type, the system does not sanitize the HTML input leading to XSS
   -  Concise description of ads is vulnerable to XSS.
2. **Carousel Management:**
   -  The title name is vulnerable to stored XSS.
   -  The link address field is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious code cannot be changed after being written, and the vulnerability can only be eliminated by deleting the carousel item.
   -  The carousel's description field is vulnerable to stored XSS.
3. **System Settings:**
   -  The statistics code field under Basic Settings is vulnerable to stored XSS

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when a user views the affected pages.
- Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account compromise.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are through the following interfaces:
- The administrator panel for ad management (edit ad).
- The administrator panel for carousel management (add/edit carousel).
- The administrator panel for system settings (edit system settings).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the YZMCMS system to create and edit ads, carousels, and system settings.
- No special permissions are required, other than the admin access to modify the vulnerable fields.
