- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Force First and Last Name as Display Name plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is done through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor can induce a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an unwanted action. Unauthenticated access is required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
