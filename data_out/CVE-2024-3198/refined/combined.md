Awesome icons, thank you
But
1. Please add Telegram sharing button Please Please Please Please
2. Please add ability to use your social icons as shortcode. For example, I need to use them only at one or two of blog pages, not at all.

### Description

The WP Font Awesome Share Icons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's
'wpfai\_social' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
