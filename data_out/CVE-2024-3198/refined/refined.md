Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3198:

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wpfai_social` shortcode in the WP Font Awesome Share Icons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it doesn't properly sanitize user input before displaying it on a webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
