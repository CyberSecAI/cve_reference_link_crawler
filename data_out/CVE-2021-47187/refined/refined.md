The provided content describes a fix for incorrect CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency parameters in the Device Tree Source (DTS) file for the Qualcomm MSM8998 SoC. This issue is related to power management and system stability, not a direct security vulnerability. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to a CVE.

The changes correct the following:
*   **Root Cause**: The original DTS file had incorrect timings for CPU sleep states, and the `min-residency-us` parameter was miscalculated, particularly for power collapse states affecting both the CPU cluster and the L2 cache. The timings were using CPU sleep values instead of the higher L2 cache timings.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:  The misconfiguration caused incorrect idle state transitions. When CPU scaling is enabled, the wrong timings would lead to system instability.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** The system instability manifested as random, apparently error-less, sudden reboots and/or lockups. It did not pose any direct security risks.

*   **Attack vectors:**  The incorrect parameters were set during system initialization. The issue is triggered when CPU scaling is enabled and power collapse is frequently hit. There is no direct attack vector to exploit the misconfiguration, it is an issue of system stability due to misconfiguration.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  No attacker action is required; the issue occurs when the system operates with the misconfigured parameters and is exacerbated when CPU scaling is enabled.
