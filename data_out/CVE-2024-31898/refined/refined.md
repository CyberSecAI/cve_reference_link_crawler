- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient access controls or authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-level authenticated user can access sensitive information they are not authorized to view.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via the application itself through a user account that has insufficient privileges.
