Package        : nodejs
Version        : 10.24.0~dfsg-1~deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-30590 CVE-2023-46809 CVE-2024-22025
Debian Bug     : 1039990 1064055

Vulnerabilities have been found in Node.js, which could lead to denial
of service or information disclosure.

CVE-2023-30590

    Ben Smyth reported an inconsistency between implementation and
    documented design of the The generateKeys() API function, which
    only generates missing (or outdated) keys, that is, it only
    generates a private key if none has been set yet.
    The documented behavior has been updated to reflect the current
    implementation.

CVE-2023-46809

    It was discovered that Node.js was vulnerable to the Marvin Attack,
    allowing a covert timing side-channel during PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
    error handling.  An attacker could remotely exploit the
    vulnerability to decrypt captured RSA ciphertexts or forge
    signatures, especially in scenarios involving API endpoints
    processing Json Web Encryption messages.
    The fix disables RSA_PKCS1_PADDING for crypto.privateDecrypt(), and
    includes a security revert flag that can be used to restore support
    (and the vulnerability).

CVE-2024-22025

    It was discovered that Node.js was vulnerable to Denial of Service
    by resource exhaustion in fetch() brotli decoding.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
10.24.0~dfsg-1~deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your nodejs packages.

its security tracker page at:
