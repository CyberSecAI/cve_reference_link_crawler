The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6241.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `${}` in the `SysDictDataMapper.xml` to pass in parameters without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input being directly used in SQL queries. Specifically the `text`, `code`, `table` and `filterSql` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Depending on the database setup, it may allow for more severe system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/system/dictData/getDictItems/{dictCode}` and  `/system/dictData/getDictItems/gen_table` endpoints by manipulating the `dictCode` parameter which then influences the `text`, `code`, `table` and `filterSql` parameters that are passed to the SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application and needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional Information:**
- Two separate SQL injection vulnerabilities are described, one via `sys_user` dictCode and another via `gen_table` dictCode
- The affected version is Pear Admin Boot <= 2.0.2
- Proof of concept (POC) URLs are provided in the form of HTTP GET requests:
    - `http://localhost:8088/system/dictData/getDictItems/sys_user,user(),1`
    - `http://localhost:8088/system/dictData/getDictItems/gen_table,user(),1,1`
