Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-2752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause isn't explicitly stated within the provided text, but the issue is related to unspecified vulnerabilities in the MySQL and MariaDB codebases. The different sources reference this CVE alongside other related issues (e.g., CVE-2020-2760, CVE-2020-2812, CVE-2020-2814), suggesting a family of related flaws in the affected products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The documents indicate "multiple vulnerabilities" in MySQL and MariaDB, and CVE-2020-2752 is identified as one of them, affecting multiple components including the C API.
- Specifically, one of the documents points to "C API unspecified vulnerability" in the context of MariaDB Connector C.
- The openSUSE document highlights that CVE-2020-2752 could lead to an unauthorized ability to cause a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The most severe impact could be arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected process, leading to potential privilege escalation, data breaches, or complete access to the server.
- A Denial of Service (DoS) condition is the explicitly mentioned impact in some cases.
- NetApp describes this vulnerability in their products as potentially leading to "unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS)".

**Attack Vectors:**

- Attack vectors can be both local and remote, depending on the specific product and configuration.
- Some vectors involve interacting with the MySQL/MariaDB server through network protocols, which would be remote.
- The vulnerabilities exist within the client C API of MariaDB, which can be abused locally with an application using it or remotely if the application processes external user-controlled data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Some vulnerabilities can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker, particularly those related to network communication protocols.
- Other vulnerabilities may require some level of privileges on the system or database server, but the exact requirements vary.
- Some vulnerabilities can be exploited with user interaction, while some require no user interaction at all.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that an attacker could escalate privileges, gain access to critical data or cause a Denial of Service condition.
-   The Oracle advisory indicates the MySQL client/server versions prior to 5.6.47, 5.7.29 and 8.0.19 are affected.

The provided documents highlight the critical need for prompt patching of affected MySQL and MariaDB versions to mitigate the broad range of potential impacts.
