Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the `mobile` parameter within the `/admin/add_visitor.php` file of the Church Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data in the `mobile` parameter. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or encode the input when rendering it in the context of an HTML document.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the page.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could modify the website's content, redirect users to malicious sites, or steal sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Harm to Reputation:** The compromised website can harm the reputation of the website owner, leading to loss of trust from users.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts could trigger the download of malware to the victim's system without their knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `mobile` parameter of a HTTP request to `/admin/add_visitor.php`.
    *Example payload provided*: `mobile=987-65-4329<ScRiPt%20>alert(9590)</ScRiPt>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the `mobile` parameter of the `/admin/add_visitor.php` endpoint.
