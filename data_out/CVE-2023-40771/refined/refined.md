The provided content is related to CVE-2023-40771.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of `${}` to directly embed user-controlled input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, specifically within the `GridSql.xml` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of string interpolation (`${}`) instead of prepared statements or parameterized queries.
- Inadequate Input Validation: The provided SQL injection blacklist is insufficient and can be bypassed, thus failing to prevent malicious SQL injection attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database Data Exposure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- Data Manipulation: The vulnerability may allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database.
- Potential full server compromise: In some cases, depending on the database configuration and privileges, it may be possible to gain operating system level access, leading to full server compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL code through user-controlled input which is then used in the vulnerable SQL query. The specifics of which parameters are vulnerable are not specified.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is incorporated into the vulnerable SQL query. The exact method for this is not clear from this context.
- The attacker does not need any privileges other than being able to make requests to the vulnerable application.
