Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application constructs a SQL query using data from an untrusted source (user input via the `id` parameter). Specifically, the `booking.php` script on line 81 executes a SQL query with unsanitized input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not sanitize or properly validate user input before using it in a SQL query. This allows for manipulation of the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could modify the statement's meaning, potentially allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible via a GET request to `admin/operations/booking.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web application and manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL.
- No authentication is mentioned as required, implying the vulnerability could be exploited without specific credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `admin/operations/booking.php` on line 81.
- The blog post shows successful exploitation using `sqlmap`, identifying various injection techniques, including:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    - Error-based SQL injection.
    - Stacked queries injection.
    - Time-based blind SQL injection.
- Example `sqlmap` payloads demonstrate the ability to inject malicious SQL code:
  - `id=11' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (3274=3274) THEN 11 ELSE 0x28 END))-- NuzX`
  - `id=11' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7171787a71,(SELECT (ELT(6250=6250,1))),0x71786b6a71),6250)-- Xbjd`
  - `id=11';SELECT SLEEP(5)#`
  - `id=11' AND 4571=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS A, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS B, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS C WHERE 0 XOR 1)-- nHZp`
