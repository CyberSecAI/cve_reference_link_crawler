**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied content within the Knowledge Editor tile of SquaredUp DS for SCOM. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores malicious script code provided by a user. This code is then executed when other users view the affected tile.

    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Defacement of the dashboard.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker, with the ability to create or modify dashboards, injects malicious JavaScript code into the Knowledge Editor tile. When other users view the dashboard with the compromised tile, the malicious script executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
