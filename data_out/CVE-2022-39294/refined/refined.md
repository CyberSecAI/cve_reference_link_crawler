- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `conduit-hyper` crate did not impose a limit on the length of incoming HTTP requests before attempting to read the request body into memory using `hyper::body::to_bytes`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unchecked request length leading to potential excessive memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could send a malicious HTTP request with an extremely large `Content-Length` header, causing the server to attempt to allocate a large amount of memory. If this memory allocation fails, it could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via a panic, potentially crashing the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious HTTP request with a very large `Content-Length` header over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests with arbitrary headers. No specific privileges or user interaction is required.
