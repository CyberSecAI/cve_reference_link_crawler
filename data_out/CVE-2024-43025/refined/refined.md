- Phishing Attacks: By injecting malicious links or forms, attackers can trick recipients into providing sensitive information (credentials, personal data, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Payload: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML payload.
- Email Injection: The crafted payload is injected into a field within the application that is used to generate email content.
- Email delivery: The application sends the email containing the injected HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject content into a field or parameter of the vulnerable RWS MultiTrans application that will be used to generate emails. This may require the attacker to have access to the application, or may be exploitable through other means, like a web interface or API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RWS MultiTrans v7.0.23324.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is specific to how the application handles email content generation.
