Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `color` attribute within the `su_members` shortcode of the "Shortcodes Ultimate" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input for the `color` attribute of the `su_members` shortcode, allowing the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing of user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Other malicious activities performed in the context of the victim's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker uses the `su_members` shortcode in a WordPress page or post.
- The attacker injects a malicious payload within the `color` attribute of the shortcode, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- When any user visits the page where this shortcode is placed, the malicious script will execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level permissions.
- **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker must have the capability to use shortcodes within the content they can create or edit (e.g., posts, pages).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Shortcodes Ultimate plugin up to and including version 7.1.5.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.1.6 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/shortcodes/members.php`, specifically in the rendering of the `su-members` div which uses the user-provided `color` attribute without proper escaping.
- The fix involves applying `esc_attr()` to the inline style attribute in the mentioned file

```php
return '<div class="su-members' . su_get_css_class( $atts ) . '" style="' . esc_attr( 'background-color:' . su_adjust_brightness( $atts['color'], 50 ) . ';border-color:' . su_adjust_brightness( $atts['color'], -20 ) . ';color:' . su_adjust_brightness( $atts['color'], -60 ) ) . '">' . str_replace( '%login%', $login, su_do_attribute( $atts['message'] ) ) . '</div>';
```
