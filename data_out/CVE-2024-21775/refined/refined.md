Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability found in the report export functionality of ManageEngine Exchange Reporter Plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields (likely related to the report export feature), which will then be executed by the database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Administrative Rights:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain administrative rights to the product database. This grants the attacker significant control over the data, and potentially other aspects of the application or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the report export functionality. It is likely that the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user inputs related to report parameters, column selection or other inputs when creating a report to be exported.
*   The attacker would need to access the product's user interface to exploit the report export functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the Exchange Reporter Plus application and the ability to use its export functionality, which would most likely require having a valid user account, with the potential for escalated permissions.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQL payload.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Exchange Reporter Plus up to and including build 5714.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in build 5715, released on January 24, 2024.
*   The initial severity was classified as "Critical" but was later reduced to "High" after further analysis by the vendor.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by minhgalaxy.
