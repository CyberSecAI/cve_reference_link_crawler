…[]` behavior ([#112617](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112617))

Restore `subprocess`'s intended use of `vfork()` by default for performance on Linux;
also fixes the behavior of `extra_groups=[]` which was unintentionally broken in 3.12.0:

Fixed a performance regression in 3.12's :mod:`subprocess` on Linux where it
would no longer use the fast-path ``vfork()`` system call when it could have
due to a logic bug, instead falling back to the safe but slower ``fork()``.

Also fixed a security bug introduced in 3.12.0.  If a value of ``extra_groups=[]``
was passed to :mod:`subprocess.Popen` or related APIs, the underlying
``setgroups(0, NULL)`` system call to clear the groups list would not be made
in the child process prior to ``exec()``.

The security issue was identified via code inspection in the process of
fixing the first bug.  Thanks to [@vain](https://github.com/vain) for the detailed report and
analysis in the initial bug on Github.
