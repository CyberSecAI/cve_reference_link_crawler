Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the "username" parameter in the `admin_class.php` file of the "Banking Management System Project In PHP" version 1.0.
- User-supplied input for the username is directly incorporated into SQL queries without sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Exploitation could lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint.
- **Username Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is injected into the "username" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/ajax.php?action=login`) and the vulnerable parameter (`username`).
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No Login Verification Required:** The vulnerability exists in the login function itself, bypassing initial login checks.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker may not see direct output from the database but can infer results based on response times.
- The provided payload `username=admin' AND (SELECT 8662 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))TRVU) AND 'IkjM'='IkjM&password=admin` demonstrates how to induce a delay using the `SLEEP()` function, a common technique for exploiting time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is located in the `admin_class.php` file
- The provided Github link includes a screenshot of the usage of `sqlmap` for automated exploitation.
