Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34698

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `getQueryParam` function located in `/public/js/main.js`. This function recursively merges user-controlled URL query parameters into an existing object without proper sanitization of the parameter keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `getQueryParam` function merges user-supplied query parameters, and when a key named `__proto__` (or with a similar pattern like `__proto__[nested_property]`) is provided, the function modifies the prototype of the object being targeted instead of adding properties to the object itself. This allows an attacker to modify the base object prototype.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The function does not sanitize the keys of the URL parameters before merging them, specifically, it doesn't prevent the `__proto__` property from being set.
- **Recursive Object Merging:** The recursive nature of the merge operation, allows an attacker to set arbitrarily nested properties on the prototype

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** An attacker can control properties of objects that are otherwise inaccessible by polluting the prototype.
- **Chaining with Other Vulnerabilities:** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities such as DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, or HTML injection if the application uses attacker-controlled properties in an unsafe way.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Query Parameters:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with specific query parameters.
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges.
- **User Interaction Required:** The victim needs to visit the crafted URL.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim.
- **Knowledge of Application Logic:** An attacker needs to know how the application uses properties of the objects, and which properties to control to perform a specific attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 1.8.139.
- The patch in version 1.8.139 mitigates the vulnerability by adding a check that prevents properties beginning with "__proto__" from being merged into the target object.
- The CVSS score is 4.6 (Moderate), with specific metrics:
    - Attack Vector: Network
    - Attack Complexity: High
    - Privileges Required: Low
    - User Interaction: Required
    - Scope: Unchanged
    - Confidentiality: Low
    - Integrity: Low
    - Availability: Low
