A vulnerability has been identified in Siemens SINEC Security Monitor (All versions < V4.9.0). The affected application does not properly validate a file path that is supplied to an endpoint intended to create CSR files.
This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create files in writable directories outside the intended location and thus compromise integrity of files in those writable directories.
