  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control, leading to sensitive data exposure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive Data Exposure due to Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin allows unauthenticated users to access data that should be restricted.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can view sensitive information that is not intended for public access. This could be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities in the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the plugin itself, specifically by exploiting the lack of access control. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no prior authentication. The attacker can be anyone who can send HTTP requests to a vulnerable website with the affected plugin installed."
