The provided content relates to CVE-2024-30883.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `aspectRatio`, `boxId`, and `multiple` variables in the image cropping function of RageFrame2 2.6.43 are not properly filtered, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of an administrator who clicks on a malicious link. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL with a crafted XSS payload in the `aspectRatio`, `boxId`, or `multiple` parameters. This URL is then sent to the targeted admin user, typically via social engineering, who must click the URL to trigger the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (typically an admin) into clicking it. The attacker does not require any prior access to the system.
