Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `booking_export_all()` function of the EventPrime plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of a capability check before allowing access to the `booking_export_all()` function. This function is responsible for exporting all event booking data, which includes PII.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  Although not explicitly stated, the lack of authorization could be considered a form of insecure direct object reference, as any authenticated user could access the export function without proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive event booking data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request to the WordPress backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/service/class-ep-ajax.php` file, specifically the `booking_export_all()` function.
- The fix involves adding a capability check to ensure that only users with appropriate permissions can access this function. The updated code checks if the user is logged in and has either 'edit_em_event' or 'edit_posts' capability.
- The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 3.4.1 of the EventPrime plugin.
- The patched version is 3.4.2 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also includes the changes made in the patched version which include version updates and adding the capability check to the export function.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3, rated as medium severity.
