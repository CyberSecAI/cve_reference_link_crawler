The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44395.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `GetMask`'s JSON `param` parser within the `cgiserver.cgi` process incorrectly assumes the `param` JSON element is an object. It attempts to access this element using the subscription operator (`[]`) as if it were an object, but if a string is passed instead of an object, the program will trigger an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The `cgiserver.cgi` process fails to validate the type of JSON element being passed to the `GetMask` API's parameter parser. It assumes the `param` value is always an object, leading to a crash when it is not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a malformed JSON `param` value, an attacker can cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, which triggers a device reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body where the `param` value for the `GetMask` command is a string instead of an object.
  ```
  [
      {
          "cmd": "GetMask",
          "action": 0,
          "param":  ""
      }
  ]
  ```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device.
- While the report mentions that most of these issues require an authenticated user, they note that another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) can allow exploitation without authentication.
