Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw present in the `edit_fuel.php` file of the SourceCodester Petrol Pump Management Software v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `id` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information can be obtained by an attacker by injecting SQL queries. This could include database schema, user credentials, and other data stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `admin/edit_fuel.php` file. An attacker would manipulate this parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the vulnerable application, specifically the `admin/edit_fuel.php` page.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes**
- The VulDB entry ([281936](?id.281936)) provides more detail including the vulnerable file, parameter, and the fact it is a high risk vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been accepted as valid.
