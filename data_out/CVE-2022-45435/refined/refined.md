Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-45435:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authorization issue in SailPoint IdentityIQ.
- Authenticated users with the "Identity Administrator" capability or any custom capability containing the "SetIdentityForwarding" right are able to modify work item forwarding configurations for identities that they should not have access to modify based on the Lifecycle Manager Quicklink Population configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The system fails to properly enforce access controls for modifying identity forwarding configurations. Specifically, it allows users with the specified rights to modify configurations for identities beyond their intended scope.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not correctly restrict which identities' forwarding settings can be modified by authorized users, resulting in a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially modify work item forwarding for other users, potentially causing workflow disruptions or information exposure depending on how the forwarded work items are handled.
- Attackers may be able to disrupt workflows or impersonate other users.
- The impact includes both Integrity and Confidentiality loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have a valid account with the necessary administrative rights ("Identity Administrator" capability or custom capability with "SetIdentityForwarding" right).
- The attacker uses the IdentityIQ interface to modify the work item forwarding configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with either the Identity Administrator capability or a custom capability with the 'SetIdentityForwarding' right.
- The attacker must have access to the IdentityIQ application.

**Affected Versions:**
- IdentityIQ 8.3 and all 8.3 patch levels prior to 8.3p2
- IdentityIQ 8.2 and all 8.2 patch levels prior to 8.2p5
- IdentityIQ 8.1 and all 8.1 patch levels prior to 8.1p7
- IdentityIQ 8.0 and all 8.0 patch levels prior to 8.0p6
- All prior versions of IdentityIQ

**Resolution:**
- SailPoint has released e-fixes for each impacted and supported version of IdentityIQ and are included in future patch levels.

**CVSS v3 Score:**
- 6.8
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
