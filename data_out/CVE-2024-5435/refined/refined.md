Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5435:

**CVE Description:**
Credentials disclosed when repository mirroring fails

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles and displays error messages related to repository mirroring. Specifically, when a repository mirroring operation fails, the error message inadvertently includes the user's password used for authentication with the remote repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** Usernames and passwords used for repository mirroring are exposed in the error messages.
- **Insecure Error Handling:** The system fails to properly sanitize and mask sensitive information before displaying error messages to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to mirrored repositories and other related systems.
- **Lateral Movement:** The exposed credentials could be reused to gain access to other systems if the same password is used across different accounts or services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forced Mirror Update:** An attacker could force a mirror update that would fail to trigger the vulnerable error handling
- **Improperly Configured Mirror:** An attacker who has permissions to manage the repository could configure a mirror that would fail and trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a GitLab user with at least 'maintainer' level permissions for a project to add and manage repository mirroring configurations.
- Access to the GitLab UI to trigger the mirror update process.

**Affected Versions:**
GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 15.10 before 17.1.7, all versions starting from 17.2 before 17.2.5, all versions starting from 17.3 before 17.3.2.
