```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `triggerList` method in `SqliteClient.ts` constructs an SQL query using the user-controlled `table_name` parameter without proper sanitization. This parameter is obtained from the `tableCreate` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (CWE-89)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker with creator access can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database, leading to potential information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a specially crafted payload within the `table_name` parameter to the `tableCreate` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have creator access."
