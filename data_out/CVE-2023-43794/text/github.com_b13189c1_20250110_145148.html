# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') in nocodb

Moderate

published
GHSA-3m5q-q39v-xf8f
Oct 17, 2023

## Package

npm

nocodb
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

0.109.2

## Patched versions

0.111.0

## Description

## Summary

Nocodb contains SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying database.

## Product

nocodb/nocodb

## Tested Version

[0.109.2](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/releases/tag/0.109.2)

## Details

### SQL injection in `SqliteClient.ts` (`GHSL-2023-141`)

By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given below parameter and endpoint, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this is a blind SQL injections, an attacker may need to use time-based payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds. The response time indicates, whether the result of the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result, the HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds, indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way, an attacker can reveal the data present in the database.

The [`triggerList`](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/3ec82824eeb2295f6b67fd67e7d6049784b41221/packages/nocodb/src/db/sql-client/lib/sqlite/SqliteClient.ts#L628-L654) method creates a SQL query using the user-controlled [`table_name`](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/3ec82824eeb2295f6b67fd67e7d6049784b41221/packages/nocodb/src/db/sql-client/lib/sqlite/SqliteClient.ts#L637) parameter value from the [`tableCreate`](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/3ec82824eeb2295f6b67fd67e7d6049784b41221/packages/nocodb/src/controllers/tables.controller.ts#L63) endpoint.

```
async triggerList(args: any = {}) {
  const _func = this.triggerList.name;
  const result = new Result();
  log.api(`${_func}:args:`, args);

  try {
    args.databaseName = this.connectionConfig.connection.database;

    const response = await this.sqlClient.raw(
      `select *, name as trigger_name from sqlite_master where type = 'trigger' and tbl_name='${args.tn}';`,
    );
[...]
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
