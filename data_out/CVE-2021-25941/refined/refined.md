{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `override()` function in the `deep-override` NPM module does not validate the type of object before assigning values to properties, specifically not checking if the property is part of the object itself or if it's a property of the prototype.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) and potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) by manipulating the object prototype.",
    "attack_vectors": "By supplying a malicious value in the `rawArgs` argument of the `override()` function which includes the `__proto__` property. The function does not validate if the property is part of the object or prototype before assigning, allowing the attacker to pollute the prototype.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `override()` function, specifically the `rawArgs` argument to include the `__proto__` property."
  },
  "fix": "Upgrade to version 1.0.2 of the `deep-override` package."
