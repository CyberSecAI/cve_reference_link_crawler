Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-26786.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `iopt_add_access()` function within the `drivers/iommu/iommufd/io_pagetable.c` file. Specifically, the `access->iopt_access_list_id` is being overwritten prematurely when `xa_alloc()` succeeds, but `iopt_calculate_iova_alignment()` fails. This leads to a mismatch between the access pointer in the list and the actual pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Premature update of `access->iopt_access_list_id`: The code was updating the `iopt_access_list_id` before verifying if `iopt_calculate_iova_alignment()` was successful.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The incorrect `iopt_access_list_id` can lead to a crash when the list is accessed, which causes a kernel panic, as indicated by the syzkaller report:
`WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 4738 at drivers/iommu/iommufd/io_pagetable.c:1360`
- This overwrite results in a mismatch between the access pointer in the list and the passed-in pointer, leading to use-after-free issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `iommufd_access_change_ioas()` function.
- The specific scenario involves calling `iopt_add_access()` when `xa_alloc()` succeeds but `iopt_calculate_iova_alignment()` fails.
- The syzkaller report indicates that the issue was discovered through fuzzing, so a crafted sequence of system calls related to `iommufd` would be the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to call the relevant `iommufd` syscalls.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position. The issue can be triggered by an unprivileged user.
