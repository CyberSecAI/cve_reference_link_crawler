Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36919:

**CVE-2022-36919**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint of the Coverity Plugin.
*   **Vulnerability:** The Coverity Plugin, version 1.11.4 and earlier, does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These enumerated IDs can then be used in other attacks to capture the credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access is required. An attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Coverity plugin fails to perform permission checks, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability. Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can exploit this to list credential IDs stored within Jenkins which can then be used for further attacks.
