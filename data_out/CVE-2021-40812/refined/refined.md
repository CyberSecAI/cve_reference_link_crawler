Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of return value checks for the `gdPutBuf` function in several locations within the `libgd` library, specifically in the BMP and WebP image handling code. The `gdPutBuf` function is used to write data to an output buffer, and like `gdGetBuf`, it can return an error if the write operation fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Error Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks on the return value of `gdPutBuf` in `gd_bmp.c` and `gd_webp.c`. This means that if the write operation fails (e.g., due to insufficient disk space or other I/O issues), the program will not detect the error and will proceed as if the write was successful. This can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
- **Tainted Arguments:** The issue also mentions that the arguments passed to these vulnerable calls can be tainted or corrupted. This suggests that a malicious or malformed image could potentially manipulate the size or content of the buffer passed to `gdPutBuf`, further exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** According to the Debian security advisory, the lack of proper error handling can lead to denial of service attacks through out-of-bounds reads or NULL pointer dereferences. While this isn't explicitly detailed in the commit diff or issue discussion, the missing error checks and potential for malformed data could lead to crashes or infinite loops.
- **Data Corruption:**  Failure to properly write image data can result in corrupt images and unexpected behavior in applications using libgd.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image Files:** An attacker could create a specially crafted BMP or WebP image file that, when processed by `libgd`, triggers the vulnerability. This malicious image could cause errors during the write operation with `gdPutBuf` leading to the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious BMP or WebP image file to an application that uses `libgd` to process it. This could be via a website, an email attachment, or other means.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Partial Fix:** The provided commit log indicates a partial fix that addresses the issue in BMP and WebP but not in GIF processing due to refactoring challenges.
- **Issue 750:** The GitHub issue #750 provides more context and indicates that previous similar issues with `gdGetBuf` led to out-of-bounds reads.
- **Debian LTS:** The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE, along with others, was addressed in a security update.

In summary, CVE-2021-40812 is a vulnerability caused by missing error handling for the `gdPutBuf` function in `libgd`, leading to potential denial of service or data corruption when processing specially crafted image files. The fix in the commit referenced by the github page and the Debian advisory adds error checking to the `gdPutBuf` calls in `gd_bmp.c` and `gd_webp.c`.
