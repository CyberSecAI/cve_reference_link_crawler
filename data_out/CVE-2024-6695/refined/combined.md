## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# profile-builder < 3.11.9 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation

### Description

it's possible for an attacker to gain administrative access without having any kind of account on the targeted site and perform unauthorized actions. This is due to improper logic flow on the user registration process.

### Proof of Concept

1. "Login after registration" option has to be enabled.
2. Register using an administrator email like:
administrator@adminemail.com
make sure to use spaces in the e-mail.
3. The following url format can be used to login (if you don't get redirected):
http://testsire/?p=403&autologin=true&uid=1&\_wpnonce=93720382a4
the nonce can be taken from the "autologin" redirect once the registration is finished.
