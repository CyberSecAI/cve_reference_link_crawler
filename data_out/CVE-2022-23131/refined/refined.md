- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unsafe client-side session storage in Zabbix Frontend when SAML SSO authentication is enabled. Session data, including user login information, was not being properly verified, allowing for manipulation by malicious actors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of server-side validation of session data stored client-side when SAML authentication is in use. This allows an attacker to modify the session data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can modify session data to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Zabbix Frontend. This can lead to privilege escalation and potential instance takeover, including gaining admin access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the client-side session storage vulnerability. The attacker needs to know the username of a Zabbix user or utilize the guest account (if enabled). The attacker then modifies the session data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have knowledge of a valid Zabbix username or use a guest account if enabled. The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify client-side session data. SAML authentication must be enabled on the targeted Zabbix instance.
