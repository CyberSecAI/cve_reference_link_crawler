The provided content is related to CVE-2024-34126.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the affected system.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- User interaction is required (UI:R).
- The vulnerability scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running and trick a user into some kind of interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
