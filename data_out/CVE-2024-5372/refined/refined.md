**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `activity_contact` parameter in the `submit_extracurricular_activity.php` file of the Kashipara College Management System is vulnerable to XSS injection. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the web page.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input sanitization or output encoding for the `activity_contact` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter.

    *   Displaying inappropriate content.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Downloading malware to the user's system.
    *   Compromising the user's account or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload containing JavaScript code.
*   This payload is submitted through the vulnerable `activity_contact` parameter in the `submit_extracurricular_activity.php` file, likely via a web form.
