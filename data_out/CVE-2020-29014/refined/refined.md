- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition due to improper synchronization when using shared resources in the FortiSandbox command shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Race condition vulnerability where concurrent execution using shared resources lacks proper synchronization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can cause the system to become unresponsive via a specifically orchestrated sequence of commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated attacker with access to the command shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the command shell interface.
