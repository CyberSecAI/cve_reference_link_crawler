Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the implementation of the `copyContent` command in LG Simple Editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or restrict XML external entity references, allowing an attacker to include external entities in the XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to force the XML parser to access a URI specified in a crafted XML document. The content retrieved from the URI is then embedded back into the XML document for further processing, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information on the system where the application is running. The vulnerability allows for disclosure of information in the context of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted XML document with an embedded URI that is sent to the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XML document to the LG Simple Editor application.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vendor has stated that they do not plan to fix the vulnerability.
- The only mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application.
