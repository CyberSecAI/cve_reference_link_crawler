  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when updating settings, and it does not sanitize or escape user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which are then executed in the browsers of users who view pages containing a 3D flipbook.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=fb3d_receive_book_control_props` parameter and a malicious payload within the `props[lightbox][default]` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber."
