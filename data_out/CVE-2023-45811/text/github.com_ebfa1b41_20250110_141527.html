# Prototype pollution vulnerability leading to arbitrary code execution

High

[relative](/relative)
published
GHSA-jg82-xh3w-rhxx
Oct 17, 2023

## Package

npm

deobfuscator
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=2.0.1, <=2.4.3

## Patched versions

2.4.4

## Description

### Impact

A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in synchrony versions before v2.4.4. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Summary

A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in the [LiteralMap](src/transformers/literalmap.ts) transformer allowing crafted input to modify properties in the Object prototype.

When executing in Node.js, due to use of the `prettier` module, defining a `parser` property on `__proto__` with a path to a JS module on disk [causes a `require` of the value](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/2.5.1/src/main/parser.js#L53-L63) which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Patch

A fix has been released in `deobfuscator@2.4.4`.

### Mitigation

* Upgrade synchrony to v2.4.4
* Launch node with the [--disable-proto=delete](https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/cli/#--disable-protomode) or [--disable-proto=throw](https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/cli/#--disable-protomode) flag

### Proof of Concept

Craft a malicious input file named `poc.js` as follows:

```
// Malicious code to be run after this file is imported. Logs the result of shell command "dir" to the console.
console.log(require('child_process').execSync('dir').toString())

// Synchrony exploit PoC
{
  var __proto__ = { parser: 'poc.js' }
}
```

Then, run `synchrony poc.js` from the same directory as the malicious file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
