- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated and remote attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem.
- **Attack vectors**: Specially crafted web requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send web requests to the FortiExtender management interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
