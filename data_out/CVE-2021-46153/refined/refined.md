Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-46153:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NEU files within Siemens Simcenter Femap. This lack of validation leads to memory corruption issues. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write condition can occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of user-supplied data
- Out-of-bounds write (write past the end of an allocated data structure)
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Simcenter Femap.
- This could lead to full system compromise depending on the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a user opening a malicious NEU file with the affected application.
- Alternatively, a user may be tricked into visiting a malicious page that could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious NEU file
- The attacker must get the user to open the malicious NEU file, or visit a malicious page.
- No special privileges are needed on the local machine.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "xina1i" (at various affiliations) to the vendor.
- Siemens has released an update to address the vulnerability (Simcenter Femap V2022.1 or later).
- The vulnerability is related to multiple ZDI advisories (ZDI-22-297, ZDI-22-298, ZDI-22-299, ZDI-22-300) with specific ZDI-CAN IDs (ZDI-CAN-14645, ZDI-CAN-15305, ZDI-CAN-15589, ZDI-CAN-15599)
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-119, indicating an issue with improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer
