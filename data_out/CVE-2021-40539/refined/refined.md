Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how ADSelfService Plus handles REST API URLs.
*   Specifically, the security filter responsible for authenticating REST API requests fails to properly normalize URLs before validation. This allows specially crafted URLs to bypass the authentication filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism designed for REST API endpoints due to improper URL normalization.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to correctly validate and sanitize the incoming URL requests, which leads to the bypass.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access REST API endpoints which can then be used to execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The RCE can lead to a complete compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data and the ability to perform further malicious actions on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted REST API URLs:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted URLs to the ADSelfService Plus server. These URLs bypass the authentication filter due to the normalization error.
*   **Network Accessible:** The vulnerable REST API endpoints are accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the ADSelfService Plus server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with modified URLs to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

*   **Affected Versions:** ADSelfService Plus builds up to 6113 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in ADSelfService Plus build 6114.
*   **Exploit Detection:** ManageEngine provides an exploit detection tool, and instructions for manually checking logs and specific files for signs of compromise.
*   **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** The document provides specific log entries and files that can indicate if a system has been compromised.
*   **Incident Response:** The document includes an incident response plan with steps to take if a system is compromised, including isolating affected machines, performing backups, and restoring from a clean installation.
*   **Third party assessment:** ManageEngine partnered with Veracode to conduct penetration testing.
*   **CrowdStrike IoCs:** CrowdStrike also released IoCs related to this vulnerability including specific files, directories and jar files.
