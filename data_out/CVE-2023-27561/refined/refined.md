{
  "CVE-2023-27561": {
    "Description": "runc versions prior to 1.1.5 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition during volume mounting, specifically when a symlink in the container's rootfs points to a directory on a shared volume. This allows a malicious container to manipulate the mount point, bypassing intended security restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Race condition during volume mounting",
      "Incorrect handling of symlinks in mount paths",
      "Bypass of read-only/mask mounts"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve container breakout and gain the ability to write to sensitive paths like /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious container image, exploiting shared volume mounts between two containers, can race the mounting of procfs and other sensitive paths to gain write access, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the container image for two containers that share a volume, and be able to spawn those containers. The attacker needs to be able to introduce symlinks into the root filesystem to redirect mount points."
