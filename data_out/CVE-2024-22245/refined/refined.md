Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-22245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The VMware Enhanced Authentication Plug-in (EAP) contains an Arbitrary Authentication Relay vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
Arbitrary Authentication Relay. The vulnerability is present in the deprecated EAP browser plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A malicious actor can trick a target domain user with EAP installed in their web browser into requesting and relaying service tickets for arbitrary Active Directory Service Principal Names (SPNs). This could lead to unauthorized access or actions within the Active Directory environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious actor needs to trick a target domain user with the EAP plugin into relaying service tickets. This is likely achieved by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or interacting with a malicious resource that makes use of the EAP plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a user who has the vulnerable EAP plugin installed in their web browser.  The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim, as this is considered a network-based attack with no required privileges. User interaction (clicking on malicious content) is required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as CRITICAL with a CVSSv3 base score of 9.6.
*   The EAP plugin was deprecated in 2021 with the release of vCenter Server 7.0u2.
*   The recommended fix is to remove the EAP plugin, following instructions in KB96442.
*   There are no workarounds available besides removing the deprecated plugin.
