Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-36131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation for the password parameter during the user registration or password change process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to enforce password complexity requirements, allowing users to set weak passwords. Specifically, a user can intercept the HTTP request and bypass password complexity, which can result in an insecure password containing only 1 character.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Insecure Passwords:** Allows users to set extremely weak passwords, such as single character passwords, making accounts highly susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Account Compromise:** Weak passwords significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts the HTTP request during password setting or change process, and modifies it to bypass password complexity validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack, or potentially through access to a compromised network.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP requests** The attacker need to know how to intercept and modify the parameters of HTTP requests.
