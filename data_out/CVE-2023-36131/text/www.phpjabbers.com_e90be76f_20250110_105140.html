Multi-calendar support

With a single installation, you can create as many booking calendars as you like. Each calendar has its own configuration, settings, and reservations. For instance, you can disable online payments for one but enable them for another, and you can manage reservations and bookings separately for each calendar.

Do you need to use another payment gateway? We can add it for you. [View all payment gateways](payment-gateways.php)

![Multiple Language Booking Calednar Script](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/multi-language-booking-calendar.jpg)

Multi-language support

The easy-to-use language editor allows you to translate your reservation calendar script and make it available in any language.

I was looking for a PHP booking script and came across phpjabbers.com, but I wanted quite a few mods done. These guy sorted them out quickly and efficiently. The after sales support is fantastic as well. Thanks, team!

Mark Thompson

“

After looking at the availability booking calendar script and studied it I bought it. While Swedish is not the most used language it started out with problems to use the special characters. It took less than one hour for PHPJabbers support team to solve this for me. Now the booking form works perfectly - well invested money!
