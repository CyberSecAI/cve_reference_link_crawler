Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authentication implementation. Specifically, the application uses a five-digit integer value for authentication, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **Weakness:**  The core weakness is the use of a predictable, small keyspace (five-digit integer) for session authentication. This makes it feasible to attempt all possible combinations.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to recover a valid session. This could potentially provide access to the application and allow for further malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a brute-force attack on the application's authentication mechanism.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send authentication requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are needed other than network access. The attacker does not need any existing credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Socomec Net Vision version 7.20.
*   The advisory mentions this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.7, with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`. This indicates the attack is local, requires high effort, no privileges, no user interaction, unchanged scope with high confidentiality and integrity impact and no availability impact.
*   The advisory also mentions that the vulnerabilities were discovered by José Daniel Martínez Coronel from IOActive.
