Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is categorized as "Sensitive Data Exposure," which means the plugin is leaking information that should be protected. The specific mechanism of the leak isn't detailed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is the exposure of sensitive data due to a broken access control, allowing unauthorized users to view information they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a malicious actor viewing sensitive data. This can then be used to potentially exploit other weaknesses in the system. The specific data exposed is not defined.
