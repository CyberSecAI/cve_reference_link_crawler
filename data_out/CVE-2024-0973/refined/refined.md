- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Custom CSS" field in the widget settings allows users to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data allows malicious code to be stored in the database and executed when the widget is rendered.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a page with the vulnerable widget. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and more.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered by a high-privileged user (Admin) creating or modifying a Facebook like widget and inserting a malicious payload in the "Custom CSS" field. When a user views the page containing the widget, the malicious JavaScript is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges within the WordPress environment to create or modify widget settings. This is explicitly stated to be exploitable by admin users even with the `unfiltered_html` capability disallowed, suggesting it is not a standard XSS that relies on unfiltered HTML.
