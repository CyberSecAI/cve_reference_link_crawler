The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the `rtw_wx_read32` function within the `r8188eu` driver, specifically addressing the issue where allocated memory (`ptmp`) was not being freed when the function returned `-EINVAL`. This patch was backported to the stable kernel tree.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `rtw_wx_read32` function in the `r8188eu` driver would allocate memory using `kmalloc` to store data being read. However, if the function encountered an error and returned `-EINVAL` it would not free the allocated memory resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory pointed to by `ptmp` was not being released when the function returned `-EINVAL`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated calls to the vulnerable function that result in `-EINVAL` would lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path that returns `-EINVAL` by providing incorrect input to the `rtw_wx_read32` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to interact with the r8188eu driver and trigger the `rtw_wx_read32` function with incorrect inputs. This usually involves using the driver through wireless configuration tools that may interface with the exposed ioctl interface.
