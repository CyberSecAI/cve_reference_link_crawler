Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Tutor LMS Elementor Addons plugin, specifically in the Course Carousel widget, fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input. This occurs in the `course_carousel_skin` attribute.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
-   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately clean the `course_carousel_skin` attribute value before using it.
-   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the attribute value when rendering the HTML, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages using the Course Carousel widget by manipulating the `course_carousel_skin` attribute.
-   These injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
-   This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    -   Session hijacking
    -   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    -   Defacing the website
    -   Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The primary attack vector is through the `course_carousel_skin` attribute within the plugin's Course Carousel widget.
-   An authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious code through the Elementor page builder interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level access.
-   **Page Building Access:** The attacker needs to be able to edit or create pages with Elementor and use the Course Carousel Widget
-  **Knowledge of Elementor:** The attacker needs to know how to use Elementor to add the widget and manipulate its settings.
-   No specific network position is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited through the WordPress admin interface.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in versions of the Tutor LMS Elementor Addons plugin up to and including 2.1.4.
-   The fix involves adding `esc_attr()` calls to sanitize the attribute value during rendering.

**Code Changes:**

The changes in the provided diffs show that `esc_attr()` was added to sanitize the following values:
- `course_carousel_skin`
- `course_carousel_dots_position`
- `course_carousel_arrow_style`
- `course_carousel_arrows_position`
- Several other parameters in templates and settings

This vulnerability is addressed in version 2.1.5 of the plugin.
