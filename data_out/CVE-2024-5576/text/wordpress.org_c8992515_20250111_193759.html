Despite going back and forth trying to get the support team access to our site (our fault) Muhammad Fayyaz suggested meeting on Zoom. Considering the 11 hour time difference between us, it was amazing that we got to talk. Again a bit difficult to reach each other at first but we within 2 days we did and M. fixed the issue I was having with the plugin in not copying over all the pages of my site. Turns out I needed to change some code in my htaccess file and now it all works. Thanks so much for your steadfast help in the face of adversity!!

This is one of the better Elementor addon plugins that I have used. The level of customization it affords for Tutor LMS with Elementor is great.

This plugin doesnt work at all! It let you create layouts and custom pages but you cannot use them in any course. “Edit with elementor” is missing in every couse and the layouts made for single courses are never displayed as a layout in any couse. Complete waste of time and money (requires Elementor Pro)

There are lots of issues with the plugin. The description states you must have the newest version of Tutor LMS (same developer). I reported numerous issues and was adviced to contact their support by mail.
The supporter told me this addon is not fully compatibel with he new version of Tutor LMS and I should roll back. For the other issues I reported, the answers completly missed what I wrote.
I am moving on to another LMS.
