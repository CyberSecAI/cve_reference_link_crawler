Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability, referred to as the "TuDoor Attack," stems from how CoreDNS handles malformed DNS responses. Specifically, it causes the resolver to ignore valid responses after receiving a malformed one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is that the resolver in CoreDNS does not properly handle or recover from malformed responses which leads to denial of service
- The vulnerability is triggered by an attacker forging a DNS response

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The primary impact is the disruption of normal DNS resolution, making services and resources inaccessible to users.
- Widespread impact as any vulnerable resolver will be affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is launched remotely.
- Attackers inject a malformed response to the correct source port.
-  The attack does not require guessing the correct TXID (Transaction ID) due to how the affected resolver handles responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable DNS resolver.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed DNS response.
- The attacker has to be able to brute-force the source port of the vulnerable resolver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects CoreDNS versions up to and including 1.10.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Xiang Li from NISL Lab of Tsinghua University.
- A fix is described by the commit message "Continue waiting after receiving malformed responses."
-  The issue is referred to as a "TuDoor Attack".
- The gist mentions that it is part of a research paper, and provides a link to the paper.
