# CoreDNS: DNS and Service Discovery

 [Download](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/latest)
 [View on GitHub](https://github.com/coredns/coredns)
 [Manual](/manual/toc/)

[Version 1.12.0](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/latest). Released 2024-11-21.
[Release notes](/2024/11/21/coredns-1.12.0-release/).

### What is it?

CoreDNS is a [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) server.
It is written in [Go](https://golang.org).
It can be used in a multitude of environments because of its flexibility.
CoreDNS is licensed under the
[Apache License Version 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), and completely open source.

Development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/coredns/coredns). Some devs hang
out on [Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) on the #coredns channel.

### Plugins

CoreDNS chains [plugins](/plugins).
Each plugin performs a DNS function, such as
[Kubernetes service discovery](/plugins/kubernetes),
[prometheus metrics](/plugins/metrics),
[rewriting queries](/plugins/rewrite), or *just* serving
from [zone files](/plugins/file).
And
[many](/plugins/)
[more](/explugins/).

### CNCF

We are a [Cloud Native Computing
Foundation](https://cncf.io) graduated project.

### Service Discovery

CoreDNS integrates with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) via the
[Kubernetes plugin](/plugins/kubernetes/),
or with [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/) with the
[etcd plugin](/plugins/etcd/). All major cloud providers have plugins too:
[Microsoft Azure DNS](/plugins/azure), [GCP Cloud DNS](/plugins/clouddns) and
[AWS Route53](/plugins/route53).

### Fast and Flexible

We aim to make CoreDNS fast and efficient. It is also flexible thanks to its
[plugins](/plugins).
You can compile CoreDNS with only [the plugins you need](/2017/07/25/compile-time-enabling-or-disabling-plugins/).

### Simplicity

We strive to keep things as simple as possible and have sane defaults.
Here is the `Corefile` for `coredns.io`:

```

coredns.io {
 file db.coredns.io.signed
 transfer {
  to * 185.49.140.62
 }
 sign zones/coredns.io {
  key file Kcoredns.io.+013+16376
 }
}
```
