Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-2309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the VMSVGA component of Oracle VirtualBox.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it into a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Heap-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to the hypervisor context.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker can execute code with the privileges of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the guest operating system.
*   High-Privileged Code Execution: The attacker needs to be able to execute high-privileged code on the guest OS to trigger the vulnerability.
*   VGA Component: The specific vulnerability resides within the VirtualBox's VGA emulation component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local access to the guest OS.
*   Ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest OS.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable component within VirtualBox (VMSVGA).

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in Oracle VirtualBox versions prior to 6.1.20 (according to the Oracle advisory) or 6.1.36 (according to the Gentoo advisory, which may include additional fixes)
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the process of copying user-supplied data.
*   The ZDI advisory notes this is a privilege escalation vulnerability, requiring high privileges on the guest to exploit.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5, indicating a high severity vulnerability with a local attack vector, complex attack conditions, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The provided information from ZDI provides more details about the specific component (VMSVGA), the mechanism of the vulnerability (heap-based buffer overflow), and the required attacker capabilities (high-privileged code execution on the guest OS) than the description from the Gentoo advisory.
