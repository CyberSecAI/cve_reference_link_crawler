- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in Shortcuts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a shortcut to view the hidden photos album without requiring authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A shortcut may be able to access and view photos that are intended to be hidden from view without proper authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious shortcut exploiting the logic flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create or have the user run a malicious shortcut on the affected system.
