**Vulnerability:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials

**Root Cause:** The affected product uses hard-coded credentials.

**Weaknesses:** Hard-coded credentials present a significant security risk because they are easily discoverable through reverse engineering, code analysis, or by insider threats.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use these hard-coded credentials to connect to a specific port, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, implying that the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, not just from the local machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior access to the system. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely, over the network.
