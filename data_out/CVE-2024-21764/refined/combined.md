## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker reading sensitive files from the Rapid Scada server, writing files to the Rapid Scada directory (thus achieving code execution), gaining access to sensitive systems via legitimate-seeming phishing attacks, connecting to the server and perfoming attacks using the high privileges of a service, obtaining administrator passwords, learning sensitive information about the internal code of the application, or achieving remote code execution.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Rapid SCADA, an open-source industrial automation platform, are affected:

* Rapid SCADA: Version 5.8.4 and prior

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

**3.2.4 [URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)**

The affected product may allow open redirects through the login page. This may redirect users to malicious webpages.

[CVE-2024-21794](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21794) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L)).

**3.2.5 [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**

The affected product uses hard-coded credentials, which may allow an attacker to connect to a specific port.

[CVE-2024-21764](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21764) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.6 [PLAINTEXT STORAGE OF A PASSWORD CWE-256](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html)**

The affected product stores plaintext credentials in various places. This may allow an attacker with local access to see them.

[CVE-2024-21869](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21869) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

**3.2.7 [GENERATION OF ERROR MESSAGE CONTAINING SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)**

The affected product responds back with an error message containing sensitive data if it receives a specific malformed request.

[CVE-2024-21866](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-21866) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rapid Software did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of Rapid SCADA are encouraged to contact Rapid Software and keep their systems up to date.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
