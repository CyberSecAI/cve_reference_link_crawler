- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `confctl_get_master_wlan` function in the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi system does not properly validate or parse incoming network packets. It retrieves sensitive information through `wlan_get_master_cfg` without any specific protobuf data being provided, and then sends the data as a response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation and the retrieval of sensitive data (SSID and password) without proper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information, including the Wi-Fi SSID and password, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the network.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted network packet to port 9003 of the LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi system. This can be done via Wi-Fi or a wired network connected to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network (either Wi-Fi or wired) as the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi device. No specific credentials or user interaction is required.
