Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4710
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within specific shortcodes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the page where the malicious shortcode is embedded.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the `ubermenu-col`, `ubermenu_mobile_close_button`, `ubermenu_toggle`, and `ubermenu-search` shortcodes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher within the WordPress site.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to inject the malicious shortcode into a page or post.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability allows authenticated users with at least contributor-level permissions to inject malicious scripts into pages using specific shortcodes in the UberMenu WordPress plugin. This is due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user input when processing the attributes of the shortcodes before displaying them on a page. This allows a stored XSS attack.

The vendor patched this vulnerability in version 3.8.3.
