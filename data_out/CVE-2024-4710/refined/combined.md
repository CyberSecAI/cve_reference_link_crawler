**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Description

The UberMenu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's ubermenu-col, ubermenu\_mobile\_close\_button, ubermenu\_toggle, ubermenu-search shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

* If your theme has not properly implemented WordPress 3 Menus, UberMenu may not work out of the box due to interference from the theme. You can add it to your site with a line of code via [Manual Integration](https://sevenspark.com/docs/ubermenu-3/integration/manual). See [Will UberMenu work with my theme?](https://sevenspark.com/docs/ubermenu-3/faqs/theme-compatibility)

If you have questions beyond the Knowledgebase or Video Tutorials, the [Support Center](http://sevenspark.com/help) is available to you. Please note that **all** support requests must be submitted through the support center, and questions through all other channels (including Item Comments, Emails, Facebook, Twitter, etc) will be referred there. Thanks for your cooperation! (You can click the “Support” tab at the top of this page for more details on support)

### Mobile Menu Alternatives

UberMenu is fully responsive and provides its own mobile menu. However, if you’d like to separate your mobile menu from UberMenu, we offer a free solution which complements your UberMenu installation:

#### [ShiftNav](http://wordpress.org/plugins/shiftnav-responsive-mobile-menu/)

### UberMenu Extensions

Did you previously purchase UberMenu extensions (Sticky, Conditionals, Icons, Flat Skins) through Envato? They are still available, maintained, updated, and supported – please see this article for details on the move: [UberMenu Extensions now available exclusively through sevenspark.com](http://sevenspark.com/announcements/ubermenu-extensions-now-available-exclusively-sevenspark-com)
