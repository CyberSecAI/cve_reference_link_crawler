Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `form_fast_setting_internet_set` function of the Tenda AX1803 router firmware. This is caused by the improper handling of the `adslPwd` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`adslPwd`) before using it in a system command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system. This could potentially lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the router.
    - Installation of malware or backdoors.
    - Data theft.
    - Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_internet_set` endpoint.
- **Malicious `adslPwd` Parameter:** The attack injects malicious code inside the `adslPwd` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This usually means being on the same network as the router.
- **Knowledge of Target URL and Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/fast_setting_internet_set`) and the vulnerable parameter (`adslPwd`).
- **Authentication Bypass:** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) includes a cookie parameter for password, implying that authentication is required. However, the details about bypassing authentication are not mentioned in the text.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Device:** Tenda AX1803 Router
- **Affected Firmware Version:** v1.0.0.1
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the command injection by echoing text to a file in `/tmp` directory.
