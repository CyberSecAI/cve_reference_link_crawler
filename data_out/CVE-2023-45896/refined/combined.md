# Vulnerabilities in 7-Zip and ntfs3

[June 19, 2024September 4, 2024](https://dfir.ru/2024/06/19/vulnerabilities-in-7-zip-and-ntfs3/) ~ [msuhanov](https://dfir.ru/author/msuhanov/)

As I demonstrated [before](https://dfir.ru/2023/11/01/cve-2023-45897-a-vulnerability-in-the-linux-exfat-userspace-tools/), the same malformed file system structures can cause overflows/over-reads in independently developed software.

Here is a recent example: a buffer overflow vulnerability found in 7-Zip — [CVE-2023-52168](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52168). This vulnerability is similar to one previously discovered by me in [the ntfsck tool](https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/issues/16) (from the NTFS-3G driver) — [CVE-2021-46790](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46790).

And even more: a buffer over-read vulnerability in 7-Zip — [CVE-2023-52169](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-52169). It shares the same mechanics as a kernel memory disclosure vulnerability in the Linux ntfs3 driver — [CVE-2023-45896](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45896).

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities mentioned above are caused by the so-called [update sequence array](https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/concepts/fixup.html).

This is an array of two-byte elements which is used in the NTFS file system to reliably detect torn (partial) writes of multiple sectors to traditional storage devices (like hard disk drives).

Let’s consider the following scenario: we have a data chunk (e.g., a file system structure) that spans across two sectors. We need to update the whole structure (i.e., two adjacent sectors) at once.

In the HDD world, in general, we can [atomically overwrite one sector](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36570264)\*. But we have two of them… If there is a system crash or a power loss event before we write to the second sector (let’s call it “*sector #2*”), but after we wrote to the first one (“*sector #1*”), we would end up with inconsistent data (sector #1 contains “new” data, while sector #2 contains “old” data).

*\* — keep in mind that, outside of the HDD world, byte-addressable storage devices break this assumption.*

If there are no additional measures to detect such inconsistencies, software parsing that data chuck would use “old” (and no longer valid) data from sector #2 while thinking it is “new” (like in sector #1, which is the only sector updated before the failure).

Today, developers use checksums to validate on-disk data (we can calculate a checksum over bytes from both sectors and store it somewhere, in one of those sectors). But the NTFS file system was designed to use another approach:

* the NTFS driver creates a two-byte (16-bit) placeholder value;
* the NTFS driver copies the last two bytes from sector #1 and from sector #2 into sector #1, into the update sequence array specifically (this happens in memory);
* the NTFS driver replaces the last two bytes of those two sectors with that placeholder value and also stores the placeholder value into the update sequence array (again, in memory);
* the NTFS driver writes both sectors to the underlying drive.

Here is an example (with 4 sectors used by one structure):

![](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d0a1d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-d0bed182-2024-06-17-23-44-05.png?w=587)

([Source](https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/concepts/fixup.html).)

So, when reading from a drive, we can easily detect torn writes\* by comparing the last two bytes of each sector (within a single multi-sector structure) against a placeholder value, which is recorded in the first sector (of that multi-sector structure). (It is assumed that a placeholder value is different on every write of that multi-sector structure.)

*\* — and even subsector torn writes, because the placeholder value is stored in the beginning of the first sector as well as in its last two bytes. If there was a failure when writing to the sector (i.e., a partial write), these values are going to be different.*

If the last two bytes of a current sector match the placeholder value, this sector is up-to-date (and we can restore the original values of the last two bytes of that sector, since they were stored in the update sequence array, which is in sector #1). Otherwise, the sector wasn’t updated for some reason (there was a torn write).

The update sequence array is stored in sector #1 and it consists of the following elements:

* a placeholder value (two bytes);
* original values to be restored (two bytes each).

The update sequence array length (as a number of two-byte elements) is also stored in sector #1.

For a file system structure occupying 1024 bytes (i.e., two 512-byte sectors, like a file record segment in the NTFS file system), the only valid size of the update sequence array is 3 elements (one placeholder value, two original values). However, we can craft a file system image that contains more elements in the update sequence array than required.

Most NTFS drivers/parsers will reject such an invalid update sequence array, but if there are no proper boundary checks, it would trigger an out-of-bounds write of two bytes, at the following offsets: 512\*i-2 (in the 1024-byte case, when the allocated buffer size is 1024 bytes, *i* is 3, 4, 5 and so on).

This happened to the ntfsck tool ([report](https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/issues/16)). And now, to the 7-Zip archiver!

Before 7-Zip 24.01 beta, it was possible to craft a file system image that would trigger the overflow.

The vulnerable code in the NTFS handler was:

*In the CMftRec::Parse() function (some comments starting with “//” are mine):*

```
  {
    UInt32 usaOffset;
    UInt32 numUsaItems;
    G16(p + 0x04, usaOffset); // 'p' here is 'ByteBuf' in another function below.
    G16(p + 0x06, numUsaItems); // Get the update sequence array length from a disk.

    /* NTFS stores (usn) to 2 last bytes in each sector (before writing record to disk).
       Original values of these two bytes are stored in table.
       So we restore original data from table */

    if ((usaOffset & 1) != 0
        || usaOffset + numUsaItems * 2 > ((UInt32)1 << sectorSizeLog) - 2
        || numUsaItems == 0
        || numUsaItems - 1 != numSectors) // 'numSectors' here is 'numSectorsInRec' in another function below.
      return false;

    [...]

    UInt16 usn = Get16(p + usaOffset); // Get the placeholder value that should be stored in the last two bytes of the sector.
    // PRF(printf("\nusn = %d", usn));
    for (UInt32 i = 1; i < numUsaItems; i++) // No proper boundary checks here! 'numUsaItems' is attacker-controlled!
    {
      void *pp = p + (i << sectorSizeLog) - 2;
      if (Get16(pp) != usn) // Check if the placeholder value matches the last two bytes of the current sector.
        return false;
      SetUi16(pp, Get16(p + usaOffset + i * 2)); // If so, restore the last two bytes of the current sector.
    }
  }
```

*In the CDatabase::Open() function:*

```
    UInt32 blockSize = 1 << 12; // 4096 bytes!
    ByteBuf.Alloc(blockSize); // Allocate the buffer containing 4096 bytes.
    RINOK(ReadStream_FALSE(InStream, ByteBuf, blockSize));

    {
      UInt32 allocSize = Get32(ByteBuf + 0x1C); // Read the allocated structure size from a disk.
      int t = GetLog(allocSize);
      if (t < (int)Header.SectorSizeLog)
        return S_FALSE;
      RecSizeLog = t;
      if (RecSizeLog > 15)
        return S_FALSE;
    }

    numSectorsInRec = 1 << (RecSizeLog - Header.SectorSizeLog);
    if (!mftRec.Parse(ByteBuf, Header.SectorSizeLog, numSectorsInRec, 0, NULL)) // 'numSectorsInRec' here is the same as 'numSectors' in the function above.
```

So, in general, in order to validate the number of the update sequence array elements, the code quoted above uses data from a disk (or a file system image) solely. Which is attacker-controlled, of course.

It is possible to craft a file system image in a way that: ‘*allocSize*‘ is larger than 4096 bytes (e.g., 32768 bytes) and ‘*numUsaItems – 1 != numSectors*‘ is false, while the allocated buffer size (‘*ByteBuf*‘) is always 4096 bytes. When restoring the last two bytes of each sector, this allows out-of-bounds writes, beyond the boundary of the 4096-byte buffer.

*Such an overflow is very hard to exploit, but who knows…*

**Timeline** (for the 7-Zip archiver)

* 2023-08-18: the vulnerability was reported by me to Igor Pavlov.
* 2024-01-31: a fixed version (24.01 beta) is available.

---

And two buffer over-read vulnerabilities occur when parsing a file name from the NTFS file system.

In the NTFS file system, file names are stored as wide (UTF-16LE) strings in the $FILE\_NAME structure, which has the following layout:

![](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d0a1d0bdd0b8d0bcd0bed0ba-d18dd0bad180d0b0d0bdd0b0-d0bed182-2024-06-18-19-39-56.png?w=488)

([Source](https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/attributes/file_name.html).)

The idea is to modify the $FILE\_NAME attribute, so its “*Filename length in characters*” value becomes larger than a corresponding memory allocation containing the attribute. If there are no proper boundary checks, arbitrary data would appear as a part of a file name string.

In the NTFS handler (7-Zip), there was a typo in the file name length check:

```
bool CFileNameAttr::Parse(const Byte *p, unsigned size)
{
  if (size < 0x42)
    return false;
  G64(p + 0x00, ParentDirRef.Val);
  // G64(p + 0x08, CTime);
  // G64(p + 0x10, MTime);
  // G64(p + 0x18, ThisRecMTime);
  // G64(p + 0x20, ATime);
  // G64(p + 0x28, AllocatedSize);
  // G64(p + 0x30, DataSize);
  G32(p + 0x38, Attrib);
  // G16(p + 0x3C, PackedEaSize);
  NameType = p[0x41];
  unsigned len = p[0x40];
  if (0x42 + len > size) // Should be: 0x42 + len * 2 > size
    return false;
  if (len != 0)
    GetString(p + 0x42, len, Name); // This extracts a wide character string (UTF-16LE) from 'p + 0x42'.
  return true;
}
```

The check incorrectly treats the “*Filename length in [UTF-16LE] characters*” field as “*Filename length in bytes*”. So, it’s possible to include data beyond the $FILE\_NAME attribute in memory as a part of a file name string (if ‘*0x42 + len > size*‘ is false, but ‘*GetString(p + 0x42, len, Name)*‘ extracts data up to ‘*p + 0x42 + len \* 2*‘).

In the Linux ntfs3 driver, there is no check at all:

```
	if (ino == MFT_REC_ROOT)
		return 0;

	/* Skip meta files. Unless option to show metafiles is set. */
	if (!sbi->options->showmeta && ntfs_is_meta_file(sbi, ino))
		return 0;

	if (sbi->options->nohidden && (fname->dup.fa & FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN))
		return 0;

	name_len = ntfs_utf16_to_nls(sbi, fname->name, fname->name_len, name,
				     PATH_MAX);
	if (name_len <= 0) {
		ntfs_warn(sbi->sb, "failed to convert name for inode %lx.",
			  ino);
		return 0;
	}
```

In both cases (ntfs3 and 7-Zip), a missing check exposes some memory beyond the intended buffer (exposed as a part of a file name string).

In the ntfs3 case, this exposes some amount of kernel memory to userspace programs. In my tests, an unprivileged user could leak addresses from the “*/proc/kallsyms*” file by attaching a USB drive containing a crafted file system image, mounting it (in many Linux distributions, unprivileged users are allowed to mount file systems on removable drives), and listing its contents.

In the 7-Zip case, things are more complicated: there is no obvious impact of exposing bytes from memory allocations of an application launched by the same user. However, the 7-Zip library can be used by online services to parse archives uploaded by untrusted users. If the same application instance is used to parse archives uploaded by multiple users, this could expose secrets from one archive to a different user. *(**Update, 2024-07-03:** and there was one online service working this way, affected by the vulnerability.)*

**Timeline** (for the ntfs3 driver)

* 2023-08-13: the vulnerability was reported by me the Linux kernel security team.
* 2023-08-13: Greg KH and Linus Torvalds told me that this is not a security issue.

*According to Greg KH:*

> The filesystem developers say that “manually corrupted filesystem images are not a security problem”. But it is a bug, so let’s fix it and get it merged please. That’s the best way, and isn’t worth haggling over “was this specific bugfix a security fix”.
>
> Remember, in the kernel “a bug is a bug is a bug” 🙂

As a side note: unprivileged users can mount crafted file system images on removable drives, and exposing chunks of kernel memory to such users is a vulnerability. And even remote attack vectors are possible when a file system image is mounted from a network-based source (like NAS or SAN)… Are your VMware ESXi datastores local?

*For the 7-Zip archiver, the timeline is the same as described above, in the overflow case (two vulnerabilities were reported and fixed together).*

**Update (2024-07-03):**

Igor Pavlov, the author of 7-Zip, refused to provide an advisory or any related change log entries.

> If we open it now *[my note: “now” is 272 days from the vulnerability report, 106 days from the released fix]*, it will increase the risks for possible attacks as I suppose.

[Here is a screenshot of my report](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-03-at-02-13-40-7-zip-_-bugs-_-2402-two-vulnerabilities-in-the-ntfs-handler.png). The [patched code](https://github.com/ip7z/7zip/commit/fc662341e6f85da78ada0e443f6116b978f79f22) is… For the overflow:

![](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png?w=759)

The “MftRecordSizeLog” variable is properly validated:

![](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png?w=591)

And, for the over-read:

![](https://dfir.ru/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png?w=678)

Also, note that CVE IDs assigned to the new vulnerabilities described in this post are still marked as reserved.

MITRE didn’t reply to my publication request.

**Update (2024-08-28):** CVE-2023-45896 is now public, but marked as disputed (and fixed).

If unprivileged users read bytes from kernel memory, this is a vulnerability. ~~But if they do so using a malicious file system image, it’s not.~~

Two other CVE IDs (for 7-Zip) became public earlier (in July).

**Update (2024-09-04):** CVE-2023-45896 wasn’t fixed in the Linux kernel version 6.5.11, contrary to the CVE ID description.

> \*\* DISPUTED \*\* ntfs3 **in the Linux kernel before 6.5.11** allows a physically proximate attacker to read kernel memory by mounting a filesystem (e.g., if a Linux distribution is configured to allow unprivileged mounts of removable media) and then leveraging local access to trigger an out-of-bounds read. A length value can be larger than the amount of memory allocated. *[…]*

I was able to reproduce the issue using the Linux kernel version 6.8.0 (as shipped in Ubuntu 24.04.1).

It seems that MITRE misrecognized sanity checks implemented for the name field of the attribute header, because the actual out-of-bounds read reported by me was in the name field of the $FILE\_NAME structure, which is placed after the unnamed attribute header (see: [this](https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/concepts/attribute_header.html) and [this](https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/attributes/file_name.html)).

*Again: the vulnerability wasn’t fixed in the Linux kernel version 6.5.11!*

Here are the screenshots of my proof-of-concept code running on a “fixed” version (this is exactly the same code that was originally sent to the Linux kernel security team):

commit 6f699743aebf07538e506a46c5965eb8bdd2c716 upstream.
Richard reported that a serial port may end up sometimes with tx data
pending in the buffer for long periods of time.
Turns out we bail out early on any errors from pm\_runtime\_get(),
including -EINPROGRESS. To fix the issue, we need to ignore -EINPROGRESS
as we only care about the runtime PM usage count at this point. We check
for an active runtime PM state later on for tx.

tty: 8250: Add Brainboxes Oxford Semiconductor-based quirks
commit e4876dacaca46a1b09f9b417480924ab12019a5b upstream.
Some of the later revisions of the Brainboxes PX cards are based
on the Oxford Semiconductor chipset. Due to the chip's unique setup
these cards need to be initialised.
Previously these were tested against a reference card with the same broken
baudrate on another PC, cancelling out the effect. With this patch they
work and can transfer/receive find against an FTDI-based device.
Add all of the cards which require this setup to the quirks table.
Thanks to Maciej W. Rozycki for clarification on this chip.

tty: n\_gsm: fix race condition in status line change on dead connections
commit 3a75b205de43365f80a33b98ec9289785da56243 upstream.
gsm\_cleanup\_mux() cleans up the gsm by closing all DLCIs, stopping all
timers, removing the virtual tty devices and clearing the data queues.
This procedure, however, may cause subsequent changes of the virtual modem
status lines of a DLCI. More data is being added the outgoing data queue
and the deleted kick timer is restarted to handle this. At this point many
resources have already been removed by the cleanup procedure. Thus, a
kernel panic occurs.
Fix this by proving in gsm\_modem\_update() that the cleanup procedure has
not been started and the mux is still alive.
Note that writing to a virtual tty is already protected by checks against
the DLCI specific connection state.

usb: raw-gadget: properly handle interrupted requests
commit e8033bde451eddfb9b1bbd6e2d848c1b5c277222 upstream.
Currently, if a USB request that was queued by Raw Gadget is interrupted
(via a signal), wait\_for\_completion\_interruptible returns -ERESTARTSYS.
Raw Gadget then attempts to propagate this value to userspace as a return
value from its ioctls. However, when -ERESTARTSYS is returned by a syscall
handler, the kernel internally restarts the syscall.
This doesn't allow userspace applications to interrupt requests queued by
Raw Gadget (which is required when the emulated device is asked to switch
altsettings). It also violates the implied interface of Raw Gadget that a
single ioctl must only queue a single USB request.
Instead, make Raw Gadget do what GadgetFS does: check whether the request
was interrupted (dequeued with status == -ECONNRESET) and report -EINTR to
userspace.

mmap: fix error paths with dup\_anon\_vma()
commit 824135c46b00df7fb369ec7f1f8607427bbebeb0 upstream.
When the calling function fails after the dup\_anon\_vma(), the
duplication of the anon\_vma is not being undone. Add the necessary
unlink\_anon\_vma() call to the error paths that are missing them.
This issue showed up during inspection of the error path in vma\_merge()
for an unrelated vma iterator issue.
Users may experience increased memory usage, which may be problematic as
the failure would likely be caused by a low memory situation.

mmap: fix vma\_iterator in error path of vma\_merge()
commit 1419430c8abb5a00590169068590dd54d86590ba upstream.
During the error path, the vma iterator may not be correctly positioned or
set to the correct range. Undo the vma\_prev() call by resetting to the
passed in address. Re-walking to the same range will fix the range to the
area previously passed in.
Users would notice increased cycles as vma\_merge() would be called an
extra time with vma == prev, and thus would fail to merge and return.

perf evlist: Avoid frequency mode for the dummy event
[ Upstream commit f9cdeb58a9cf46c09b56f5f661ea8da24b6458c3 ]
Dummy events are created with an attribute where the period and freq
are zero. evsel\_\_config will then see the uninitialized values and
initialize them in evsel\_\_default\_freq\_period. As fequency mode is
used by default the dummy event would be set to use frequency
mode. However, this has no effect on the dummy event but does cause
unnecessary timers/interrupts. Avoid this overhead by setting the
period to 1 for dummy events.
evlist\_\_add\_aux\_dummy calls evlist\_\_add\_dummy then sets freq=0 and
period=1. This isn't necessary after this change and so the setting is
removed.
From Stephane:
The dummy event is not counting anything. It is used to collect mmap
records and avoid a race condition during the synthesize mmap phase of
perf record. As such, it should not cause any overhead during active
profiling. Yet, it did. Because of a bug the dummy event was
programmed as a sampling event in frequency mode. Events in that mode
incur more kernel overheads because on timer tick, the kernel has to
look at the number of samples for each event and potentially adjust
the sampling period to achieve the desired frequency. The dummy event
was therefore adding a frequency event to task and ctx contexts we may
otherwise not have any, e.g.,
perf record -a -e cpu/event=0x3c,period=10000000/.
On each timer tick the perf\_adjust\_freq\_unthr\_context() is invoked and
if ctx->nr\_freq is non-zero, then the kernel will loop over ALL the
events of the context looking for frequency mode ones. In doing, so it
locks the context, and enable/disable the PMU of each hw event. If all
the events of the context are in period mode, the kernel will have to
traverse the list for nothing incurring overhead. The overhead is
multiplied by a very large factor when this happens in a guest kernel.
There is no need for the dummy event to be in frequency mode, it does
not count anything and therefore should not cause extra overhead for
no reason.

rust: types: make `Opaque` be `!Unpin`
[ Upstream commit 0b4e3b6f6b79b1add04008a6ceaaf661107e8902 ]
Adds a `PhantomPinned` field to `Opaque`. This removes the last Rust
guarantee: the assumption that the type `T` can be freely moved. This is
not the case for many types from the C side (e.g. if they contain a
`struct list\_head`). This change removes the need to add a
`PhantomPinned` field manually to Rust structs that contain C structs
which must not be moved.

rust: make `UnsafeCell` the outer type in `Opaque`
[ Upstream commit 35cad617df2eeef8440a38e82bb2d81ae32ca50d ]
When combining `UnsafeCell` with `MaybeUninit`, it is idiomatic to use
`UnsafeCell` as the outer type. Intuitively, this is because a
`MaybeUninit` might not contain a `T`, but we always want the effect
of the `UnsafeCell`, even if the inner value is uninitialized.
Now, strictly speaking, this doesn't really make a difference. The
compiler will always apply the `UnsafeCell` effect even if the inner
value is uninitialized. But I think we should follow the convention
here.

A bisect pointed to the breakage beginning with commit 9fee28baa601 ("powerpc:
implement the new page table range API").
Analysis of the oops pointed to a struct page with a corrupted
compound\_head being loaded via page\_folio() -> \_compound\_head() in
hash\_page\_do\_lazy\_icache().
The access by the mpic code is to an MMIO address, so the expectation
is that the struct page for that address would be initialised by
init\_unavailable\_range(), as pointed out by Aneesh.
Instrumentation showed that was not the case, which eventually lead to
the realisation that pfn\_valid() was returning false for that address,
causing the struct page to not be initialised.
Because the system is using FLATMEM, the version of pfn\_valid() in
memory\_model.h is used:
static inline int pfn\_valid(unsigned long pfn)
{
...
return pfn >= pfn\_offset && (pfn - pfn\_offset) < max\_mapnr;
}
Which relies on max\_mapnr being initialised. Early in boot max\_mapnr is
zero meaning no PFNs are valid.
max\_mapnr is initialised in mem\_init() called via:
start\_kernel()
mm\_core\_init() # init/main.c:928
mem\_init()
But that is too late for the usage in init\_unavailable\_range() called via:
start\_kernel()
setup\_arch() # init/main.c:893
paging\_init()
free\_area\_init()
init\_unavailable\_range()
Although max\_mapnr is currently set in mem\_init(), the value is actually
already available much earlier, as soon as mem\_topology\_setup() has
completed, which is also before paging\_init() is called. So move the
initialisation there, which causes paging\_init() to correctly initialise
the struct page and fixes the bug.
This bug seems to have been lurking for years, but went unnoticed
because the pre-folio code was inspecting the uninitialised page->flags
but not dereferencing it.
Thanks to Erhard and Aneesh for help debugging.

Currently the code disables WUC only disables it for ioremap\_wc(), which
is only used when mapping writecombine pages like ioremap() (mapped to
the kernel space). But for VRAM mapped in TTM/GEM, it is mapped with a
crafted pgprot by the pgprot\_writecombine() function, in which case WUC
isn't disabled now.

s390/kasan: handle DCSS mapping in memory holes
[ Upstream commit 327899674eef18f96644be87aa5510b7523fe4f6 ]
When physical memory is defined under z/VM using DEF STOR CONFIG, there
may be memory holes that are not hotpluggable memory. In such cases,
DCSS mapping could be placed in one of these memory holes. Subsequently,
attempting memory access to such DCSS mapping would result in a kasan
failure because there is no shadow memory mapping for it.
To maintain consistency with cases where DCSS mapping is positioned after
the kernel identity mapping, which is then covered by kasan zero shadow
mapping, handle the scenario above by populating zero shadow mapping
for memory holes where DCSS mapping could potentially be placed.

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix peer entry ageing in LAG mode
[ Upstream commit 7a3ce8074878a68a75ceacec93d9ae05906eec86 ]
With current implementation in single FDB LAG mode all packets are
processed by eswitch 0 rules. As such, 'peer' FDB entries receive the
packets for rules of other eswitches and are responsible for updating the
main entry by sending SWITCHDEV\_FDB\_ADD\_TO\_BRIDGE notification from their
background update wq task. However, this introduces a race condition when
non-zero eswitch instance decides to delete a FDB entry, sends
SWITCHDEV\_FDB\_DEL\_TO\_BRIDGE notification, but another eswitch's update task
refreshes the same entry concurrently while its async delete work is still
pending on the workque. In such case another SWITCHDEV\_FDB\_ADD\_TO\_BRIDGE
event may be generated and entry will remain stuck in FDB marked as
'offloaded' since no more SWITCHDEV\_FDB\_DEL\_TO\_BRIDGE notifications are
sent for deleting the peer entries.
Fix the issue by synchronously marking deleted entries with
MLX5\_ESW\_BRIDGE\_FLAG\_DELETED flag and skipping them in background update
job.

ASoC: soc-dapm: Add helper for comparing widget name
[ Upstream commit 76aca10ccb7c23a7b7a0d56e0bfde2c8cdddfe24 ]
Some drivers use one event callback for multiple widgets but still need
to perform a bit different actions based on actual widget. This is done
by comparing widget name, however drivers tend to miss possible name
prefix. Add a helper to solve common mistakes.

fbdev: atyfb: only use ioremap\_uc() on i386 and ia64
[ Upstream commit c1a8d1d0edb71dec15c9649cb56866c71c1ecd9e ]
ioremap\_uc() is only meaningful on old x86-32 systems with the PAT
extension, and on ia64 with its slightly unconventional ioremap()
behavior, everywhere else this is the same as ioremap() anyway.
Change the only driver that still references ioremap\_uc() to only do so
on x86-32/ia64 in order to allow removing that interface at some
point in the future for the other architectures.
On some architectures, ioremap\_uc() just returns NULL, changing
the driver to call ioremap() means that they now have a chance
of working correctly.

Input: synaptics-rmi4 - handle reset delay when using SMBus trsnsport
[ Upstream commit 5030b2fe6aab37fe42d14f31842ea38be7c55c57 ]
Touch controllers need some time after receiving reset command for the
firmware to finish re-initializing and be ready to respond to commands
from the host. The driver already had handling for the post-reset delay
for I2C and SPI transports, this change adds the handling to
SMBus-connected devices.
SMBus devices are peculiar because they implement legacy PS/2
compatibility mode, so reset is actually issued by psmouse driver on the
associated serio port, after which the control is passed to the RMI4
driver with SMBus companion device.
Note that originally the delay was added to psmouse driver in
92e24e0e57f7 ("Input: psmouse - add delay when deactivating for SMBus
mode"), but that resulted in an unwanted delay in "fast" reconnect
handler for the serio port, so it was decided to revert the patch and
have the delay being handled in the RMI4 driver, similar to the other
transports.

Add custom version of wait\_after\_reset that ignores master failure when

downstream interrupt controllers (such as PLIC, IMSIC and APLIC
direct-mode) not being probed due to missing device suppliers.

can: flexcan: remove the auto stop mode for IMX93
[ Upstream commit 63ead535570f13d0e06fda3f2d020c8f5394e998 ]
IMX93 A0 chip involve the internal q-channel handshake in LPCG and
CCM to automatically handle the Flex-CAN IPG STOP signal. Only after
FLEX-CAN enter stop mode then can support the self-wakeup feature.
But meet issue when do the continue system PM stress test. When config
the CAN as wakeup source, the first time after system suspend, any data
on CAN bus can wakeup the system, this is as expect. But the second time
when system suspend, data on CAN bus can't wakeup the system. If continue
this test, we find in odd time system enter suspend, CAN can wakeup the
system, but in even number system enter suspend, CAN can't wakeup the
system. IC find a bug in the auto stop mode logic, and can't fix it easily.
So for the new imx93 A1, IC drop the auto stop mode and involve the
GPR to support stop mode (used before). IC define a bit in GPR which can
trigger the IPG STOP signal to Flex-CAN, let it go into stop mode.
And NXP claim to drop IMX93 A0, and only support IMX93 A1. So this patch
remove the auto stop mode, and add flag FLEXCAN\_QUIRK\_SETUP\_STOP\_MODE\_GPR
to imx93.

net: sched: cls\_u32: Fix allocation size in u32\_init()
[ Upstream commit c4d49196ceec80e30e8d981410d73331b49b7850 ]
commit d61491a51f7e ("net/sched: cls\_u32: Replace one-element array
with flexible-array member") incorrecly replaced an instance of
`sizeof(\*tp\_c)` with `struct\_size(tp\_c, hlist->ht, 1)`. This results
in a an over-allocation of 8 bytes.
This change is wrong because `hlist` in `struct tc\_u\_common` is a
pointer:
net/sched/cls\_u32.c:
struct tc\_u\_common {
struct tc\_u\_hnode \_\_rcu \*hlist;
void \*ptr;
int refcnt;
struct idr handle\_idr;
struct hlist\_node hnode;
long knodes;
};
So, the use of `struct\_size()` makes no sense: we don't need to allocate
any extra space for a flexible-array member. `sizeof(\*tp\_c)` is just fine.
So, `struct\_size(tp\_c, hlist->ht, 1)` translates to:
sizeof(\*tp\_c) + sizeof(tp\_c->hlist->ht) ==
sizeof(struct tc\_u\_common) + sizeof(struct tc\_u\_knode \*) ==
144 + 8 == 0x98 (byes)
^^^
|
unnecessary extra
allocation size
$ pahole -C tc\_u\_common net/sched/cls\_u32.o
struct tc\_u\_common {
struct tc\_u\_hnode \* hlist; /\* 0 8 \*/
void \* ptr; /\* 8 8 \*/
int refcnt; /\* 16 4 \*/
/\* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack \*/
struct idr handle\_idr; /\* 24 96 \*/

/\* size: 144, cachelines: 3, members: 6 \*/
/\* sum members: 140, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 \*/
/\* last cacheline: 16 bytes \*/
};
And with `sizeof(\*tp\_c)`, we have:
sizeof(\*tp\_c) == sizeof(struct tc\_u\_common) == 144 == 0x90 (bytes)
which is the correct and original allocation size.
Fix this issue by replacing `struct\_size(tp\_c, hlist->ht, 1)` with
`sizeof(\*tp\_c)`, and avoid allocating 8 too many bytes.
The following difference in binary output is expected and reflects the
desired change:

for\_each\_card\_prelinks(card, i, dai\_link) {
ret = snd\_soc\_add\_pcm\_runtime(card, dai\_link);
ret = init\_some\_other\_things(...);
if (ret)
goto probe\_end:
for\_each\_card\_rtds(card, rtd) {
ret = soc\_init\_pcm\_runtime(card, rtd);
probe\_end:
while on exit:
for\_each\_card\_rtds(card, rtd)
snd\_soc\_link\_exit(rtd);
If init\_some\_other\_things() step fails due to error we end up with
not fully setup rtds and try to call snd\_soc\_link\_exit on them, which
depending on contents on .link\_exit handler, can end up dereferencing
NULL pointer.

ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: use integer type for fll\_id and pll\_id
[ Upstream commit 2b21207afd06714986a3d22442ed4860ba4f9ced ]
As the pll\_id and pll\_id can be zero (WM8960\_SYSCLK\_AUTO)
with the commit 2bbc2df46e67 ("ASoC: wm8960: Make automatic the
default clocking mode")
Then the machine driver will skip to call set\_sysclk() and set\_pll()
for codec, when the sysclk rate is different with what wm8960 read
at probe, the output sound frequency is wrong.
So change the fll\_id and pll\_id initial value, still keep machine
driver's behavior same as before.

With the flat mode, we only attempt to allocate large memory if there is an IOMMU
connected to the ETR. If the allocation fails, we always have a fallback path
and return an error if nothing else worked. So, suppress the warning for flat
mode allocations.

ASoC: simple-card: fixup asoc\_simple\_probe() error handling
[ Upstream commit 41bae58df411f9accf01ea660730649b2fab1dab ]
asoc\_simple\_probe() is used for both "DT probe" (A) and "platform probe"
(B). It uses "goto err" when error case, but it is not needed for
"platform probe" case (B). Thus it is using "return" directly there.
static int asoc\_simple\_probe(...)
{
^ if (...) {
| ...
(A) if (ret < 0)
| goto err;
v } else {
^ ...
| if (ret < 0)
(B) return -Exxx;
v }
...
^ if (ret < 0)
(C) goto err;
v ...
err:
(D) simple\_util\_clean\_reference(card);
return ret;
}
Both case are using (C) part, and it calls (D) when err case.
But (D) will do nothing for (B) case.
Because of these behavior, current code itself is not wrong,
but is confusable, and more, static analyzing tool will warning on
(B) part (should use goto err).
To avoid static analyzing tool warning, this patch uses "goto err"
on (B) part.
