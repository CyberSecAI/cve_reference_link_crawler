{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `mi_enum_attr` function in the ntfs3 driver lacked proper checks when parsing file system attributes, specifically in handling the attribute's type, size, and resident/non-resident flags, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read due to missing size validation when parsing filename attributes.",
       "Insufficient checks on attribute type, allowing for invalid types.",
      "Lack of proper checks for resident and non-resident attribute fields, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads.",
      "Missing checks for start/end VCN (Virtual Cluster Number) values, allowing invalid VCN ranges.",
      "Missing checks on the sizes of data, allocation, and total sizes for non-resident attributes."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to kernel memory leaks, potentially revealing sensitive information. An unprivileged user could mount a specially crafted NTFS image and trigger these issues to read kernel memory addresses.",
    "attack_vectors": "A physically proximate attacker can mount a malicious NTFS filesystem image (e.g. from USB drive) or a remote attacker can provide a crafted image from a network based source, and trigger the vulnerability when the filesystem is parsed, to cause an out-of-bounds read during attribute enumeration. ",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to mount an NTFS filesystem, which can be achieved either with physical access (via a USB drive) or through remote means, like network based filesystems. The attacker also needs to be able to craft a malicious ntfs image with specific attribute metadata values in order to trigger the vulnerability."

It also clarifies the disputed status of the CVE and the fact that the reported vulnerability was not fixed in the Linux Kernel version stated on the CVE description.",
