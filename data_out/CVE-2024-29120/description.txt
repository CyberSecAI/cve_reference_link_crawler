In Streampark (version < 2.1.4), when a user logged in successfully, the Backend service would return "Authorization" as the front-end authentication credential.  User can use this credential to request other users' information, including the administrator's username, password, salt value, etc.Â 

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4
