Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that after a successful login, the Apache StreamPark backend service returns the "Authorization" header as the authentication credential to the frontend. This credential is not scoped to the logged-in user and can be used to access other users' information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage. The exposed "Authorization" credential allows an authenticated user to potentially access sensitive data of other users.
- **Insecure Credential Handling:** The application improperly handles authentication credentials by exposing them in the response and not associating them uniquely to the logged-in user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use the leaked credential to access information of other users.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, such as the administrator's username, password, and salt value, by making requests with the leaked credential.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By compromising an administrator account through credential theft, an attacker could gain full control over the StreamPark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's HTTP API. A successfully logged-in user can capture the "Authorization" header, and then reuse it to make unauthorized API requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Apache StreamPark application and successfully authenticate at least once to obtain the leaky Authorization header.
- No special privileges or system access is required beyond being a valid user.

**Additional Notes:**

- This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description. It specifies that the leaked information includes username, password, and salt values, which is quite sensitive.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 2.1.4.
- The vulnerability has a **"Severity: important"** tag.
