In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/dpaa2: Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack

For CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y kernel, explicit allocation of cpumask
variable on stack is not recommended since it can cause potential stack
overflow.

Instead, kernel code should always use *cpumask_var API(s) to allocate
cpumask var in config-neutral way, leaving allocation strategy to
CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.

Use *cpumask_var API(s) to address it.
