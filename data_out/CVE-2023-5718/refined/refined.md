```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Vue.js Devtools extension was found to leak screenshot data via the standard `postMessage()` API due to using a wildcard in the `postMessage()` function call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "The extension sends messages back to the web page listeners using a wildcard in the `postMessage()` function call, allowing any page to receive messages.",
    "The extension captures screenshot data of the current website, which could include sensitive information."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious web page can receive base64 encoded screenshot data of sensitive resources (e.g. local files, sensitive websites) that are embedded in an iframe or open in other tabs where the Vue.js Devtools extension is active.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Creating a malicious web page with an iframe targeting a sensitive resource.",
    "Registering a listener on the malicious web page to receive messages from the extension.",
    "User interaction (hovering over timeline bars) triggers the screenshot capture and data exfiltration."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious web page, which the victim has to open. The victim also needs to have the Vue.js Devtools extension installed and active."
