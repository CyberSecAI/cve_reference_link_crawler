# agent-js: Insecure Key Generation in `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate`

Critical

[rsundar01](/rsundar01)
published
GHSA-c9vv-fhgv-cjc3
Feb 21, 2024

## Package

npm

@dfinity/auth-client
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= v0.20.0-beta.0, < 1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.1

npm

@dfinity/identity
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

>= v0.20.0-beta.0, < 1.0.1

1.0.1

## Description

## Impact

The library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair via `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate` with an optional param to provide a 32 byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret key. **When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret key using secure randomness**. However, a recent change **broke this guarantee** and **uses an insecure seed for key pair generation**.

Since the private key of this identity (`535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`) is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access to a canister where this principal is the controller. Users are asked to take proactive measures mentioned below in Workarounds:Users to protect their assets.

## Patches

Patch for the vulnerability is **available in v1.0.1** for all the packages listed in the advisory. Please upgrade and deploy your canisters immediately.

## Workarounds

### Developers

The recommended fix is to upgrade the package to the patched version. If that is not possible, there are couple of workarounds to handle the insecure key generation.

1. Invoking the function as `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate(null)` would fix the broken conditional evaluation and force the function to generate a securely random seed. However, this is not guaranteed to work for future upgrades.
2. Passing a securely generated randomness as a seed to `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate` would force the library to use it as the seed to generate the key pair.

### Users

#### Removing a controller of a canister if it's the affected principal

For all canisters you control, fetch the controllers of the canisters using

```
dfx canister info --ic <CANISTER>
```

If you see the principal `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe` as one of the controllers, follow the steps below

```
dfx identity whoami # record CURRENT_IDENTITY

dfx identity new <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME>
dfx identity use <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME>
dfx identity get-principal <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME> # record NEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL

dfx identity use <CURRENT_IDENTITY>
dfx canister update-settings --ic <CANISTER> --add-controller <NEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL>
dfx canister update-settings --ic <CANISTER> --remove-controller `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`
```

For more details on canister management, please visit [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters)

#### Checking funds on wallets / ledgers

If you have funds on ledgers using a browser wallet, please check if the account principal matches `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`. If it does, please create a new account and transfer the funds to the new account immediately.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
