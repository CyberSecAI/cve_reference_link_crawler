Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-27774:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how curl handles redirects when authentication is involved. Specifically, the "same host check" that was intended to prevent credentials from being leaked to different hosts was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient "Same Host" Check:** The check failed to properly identify different hosts due to:
    - Not considering cross-protocol redirects (e.g., HTTP to FTP).
    - Ignoring different port numbers, treating them as the same host.
- **Credential Leak:**  Due to the flawed "same host" check, credentials (usernames, passwords, and even TLS SRP credentials) could be unintentionally sent to different servers via redirects.
- **Affected versions**: curl 4.9 to and including 7.82.0

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Leakage:**  Sensitive authentication information, including usernames, passwords, and TLS SRP credentials, could be exposed to unauthorized servers. This could be used to compromise user accounts or gain access to protected resources on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Redirects:** The vulnerability is triggered when curl follows an HTTP(S) redirect from an authenticated URL to a URL on a different host (cross-protocol or different port number) which an attacker controls.
- The attacker needs to be able to get the curl client to request the initial authenticated URL, which then redirects to the attacker's controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Controlled Server:**  The attacker needs a server that can receive the leaked credentials.
- **Redirect Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a redirect from a target URL using an authenticated URL.
- **User Interaction:** The victim would need to be using a curl client version vulnerable to CVE-2022-27774 and perform a request where an authenticated URL is requested, and then the server responds with a redirect to the attacker-controlled server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability has been present since curl 4.9, and attempts to fix it were made, but were flawed.
- The issue affects not only the curl tool itself, but also any applications that use libcurl.
-  NetApp products including ONTAP 9, NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller and NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node, are affected.
- The vulnerability was fixed in curl version 7.83.0.
