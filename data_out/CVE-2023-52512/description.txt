In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: nuvoton: wpcm450: fix out of bounds write

Write into 'pctrl->gpio_bank' happens before the check for GPIO index
validity, so out of bounds write may happen.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
