- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization in the `info` method of the `smartctl` package allows for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious input to the `info` method. The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code with access to the vulnerable component, which is the `smartctl` package in this case.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code that utilizes the `smartctl` package, such as in a Node.js environment, and needs to have the ability to call the `info()` function with malicious input. No special privileges are required, and no user interaction is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
