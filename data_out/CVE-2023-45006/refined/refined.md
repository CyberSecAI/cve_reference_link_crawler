- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooODT Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website, which will be executed when users visit the site. This could lead to various attacks, including redirection to malicious websites, theft of user data, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the plugin's vulnerable input fields that do not properly sanitize input, allowing a malicious actor to inject a malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
