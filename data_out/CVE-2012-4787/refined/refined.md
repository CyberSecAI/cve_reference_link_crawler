Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-4787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper reference counting in Internet Explorer when accessing an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. This leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper reference counting.
- Accessing memory that has been freed or is uninitialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks:
    - An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The attacker convinces the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through phishing or social engineering).
    - Attackers may also use compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content.
- Embedding malicious ActiveX controls:
    - Embedding an ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or compromise an existing website.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious document.
- No user interaction can force the user to load the malicious content; the user must be enticed to do so.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer 9 and 10, with varying severity depending on the operating system.
- Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers mitigates the risk when users are not visiting trusted sites.
- The provided document is for security bulletin MS12-077 and includes information about other vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-4781 and CVE-2012-4782) addressed in the same update.
