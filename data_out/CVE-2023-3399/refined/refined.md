Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the interaction between GitLab's custom project templates feature and the project import logic related to protected branches. When importing a project, GitLab replaces the `user_id` of users allowed to merge/push on protected branches with the `user_id` of the user performing the import. While this was intended for maintainers/owners importing projects, the custom project template functionality uses this same import logic. This means that if a template project has a protected branch where any user (including the template's owner, maintainer, or other specific users) has "Allowed to merge" or "Allowed to push and merge" permission, a developer using this template to create a project will inherit that permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Assumption about Import Permissions:** The assumption that only maintainers/owners would be importing projects via the standard import functionality, and therefore that the permission transfer would not be problematic, is incorrect. The custom project templates feature bypasses this assumption.
*   **Privilege Escalation via Template Import:** A developer with limited permissions can gain elevated permissions (specifically, "Allowed to merge/Allowed to push and merge" on a protected branch) in a new project created from a template, simply by using the custom project template functionality.
*   **CI/CD Variable Leakage:** The elevated permissions allow a developer to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the newly created project, and exfiltrate secrets such as CI/CD variables via a malicious script to an attacker-controlled endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CI/CD Variable Leakage:** A developer can leak sensitive CI/CD variables from the group (or subgroups) containing the project template. These variables could contain database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information. This would lead to potential compromise of systems or data protected by these secrets.
*   **Code Tampering:** With write access to the protected branch, the attacker could potentially inject malicious code and push it into production.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom Project Template Usage:** The attacker leverages the "Create from template" feature available to developers within a group that has configured a custom project template.
*   **Malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml`:** The attacker inserts a malicious script in the project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to exfiltrate CI/CD variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Developer Role:** The attacker must have the "Developer" role within the group (or a parent group) where the custom project template is configured.
*   **Knowledge of Custom Template Usage:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and configuration of custom project templates, as well as where to find them in the Gitlab UI.
*   **Basic CI/CD Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and inject commands to exfiltrate secrets.

**Summary:**

This report details a privilege escalation vulnerability in GitLabâ€™s custom project template feature. A developer can leverage this feature to obtain unintended merge/push permissions on protected branches, leading to the potential exfiltration of sensitive CI/CD variables. This vulnerability is more severe than the original CVE description, because it gives a precise exploitation method using a specific feature (custom templates) that can be abused by a developer, and details the exact impact (CI/CD secrets leak).
