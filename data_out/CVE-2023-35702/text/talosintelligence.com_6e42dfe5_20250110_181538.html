# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1783

## GTKWave FST LEB128 varint stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35704,CVE-2023-35703,CVE-2023-35702

##### SUMMARY

Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the FST LEB128 varint functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It uses a graphical user interface to convert the traces across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. So, for example, it’s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

The function `fstReaderOpen` is used to parse `.fst` files.

```
     void *fstReaderOpen(const char *nam)
     {
[1]  struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct fstReaderContext));

[2]  if((!nam)||(!(xc->f=fopen(nam, "rb"))))
             {
             free(xc);
             xc=NULL;
             }
             else
             {
             int flen = strlen(nam);
             char *hf = (char *)calloc(1, flen + 6);
             int rc;

     #if defined(FST_UNBUFFERED_IO)
             setvbuf(xc->f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0);   /* keeps gzip from acting weird in tandem with fopen */
     #endif

             memcpy(hf, nam, flen);
             strcpy(hf + flen, ".hier");
             xc->fh = fopen(hf, "rb");

             free(hf);
             xc->filename = strdup(nam);
[3]          rc = fstReaderInit(xc);

```

At [1] the `xc` structure is created, a big (about 65KB) structure that’s used to hold information regarding the `.fst` file.

At [2] the `xc->f` field is set to the file pointer returned by `fopen` after opening the file being parsed.

Then, the function `fstReaderInit` is called [3] to parse the various `.fst` sections from the input file.

```
     int fstReaderInit(struct fstReaderContext *xc)
     {
     fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
     fst_off_t endfile;
     uint64_t seclen;
     int sectype;
     uint64_t vc_section_count_actual = 0;
     int hdr_incomplete = 0;
     int hdr_seen = 0;
     int gzread_pass_status = 1;

     sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
     ...
     if(gzread_pass_status)
             {
             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, 0, SEEK_END);
             endfile = ftello(xc->f);

             while(blkpos < endfile)
                     {
                     fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[4]                  sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
                     seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

                     if(sectype == EOF)
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[5]                  if((hdr_incomplete) && (!seclen))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[6]                  if(!hdr_seen && (sectype != FST_BL_HDR))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

                     blkpos++;
                     ...

```

At [4], the `sectype` (1 byte) is read off the file. This variable will tell us which kind of sector we’re parsing. The checks at [5] and [6] are important because we don’t want to trigger them in order to reach the vulnerable code: we need to make sure `hdr_incomplete` stays 0 and that we start with a `FST_BL_HDR` sector, which will set `hdr_seen` to 1.

So, if the input file starts with a `0x00`, we’ll land inside the following condition:

```
     ...
     if(sectype == FST_BL_HDR)
             {
             if(!hdr_seen)
                     {
                     int ch;
                     double dcheck;

                     xc->start_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->end_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

[7]                  hdr_incomplete = (xc->start_time == 0) && (xc->end_time == 0);

                     ...
[8]                  hdr_seen = 1;

[9]                  xc->mem_used_by_writer = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->scope_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->var_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     ...
                     }
             }
     ...

```

`fstReaderUint64` is used to read a 64-bit unsigned integer (big endian) off the file, incrementing the current file offset.

We need to make sure that either `start_time` or `end_time` are not 0, to not set `hdr_incomplete` [7].

At [8] `hdr_seen` is set so that we can pass the check at [6] when parsing the next sections.

Finally at [9], other values are read off the file and saved into the `xc` structure.

Next, if the file contains the `FST_BL_BLACKOUT` (`0x02`) section, we’ll land inside the following block:

```
     ...
     else if(sectype == FST_BL_BLACKOUT)
             {
             uint32_t i;
             uint64_t cur_bl = 0;
             uint64_t delta;

[10]         xc->num_blackouts = fstReaderVarint32(xc->f);
             free(xc->blackout_times);
             xc->blackout_times = (uint64_t *)calloc(xc->num_blackouts, sizeof(uint64_t));
             free(xc->blackout_activity);
             xc->blackout_activity = (unsigned char *)calloc(xc->num_blackouts, sizeof(unsigned char));

             for(i=0;i<xc->num_blackouts;i++)
                     {
                     xc->blackout_activity[i] = fgetc(xc->f) != 0;
[11]                 delta = fstReaderVarint64(xc->f);
                     cur_bl += delta;
                     xc->blackout_times[i] = cur_bl;
                     }
             }

     blkpos += seclen;
     if(!hdr_seen) break;
     }

```

At [10] `num_blackouts` is read using `fstReaderVarint32`. Inside this function lies the issue, but keep in mind this is a generic function that implements LEB128 decoding. The same exact issue is present in `fstReaderVarint64`, which is called at [11], and in `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip`, which is triggered on a different code flow. These functions are called in multiple places during FST parsing. Below we describe the three vulnerable functions separately.

#### CVE-2023-35702 - fstReaderVarint32 stack-based buffer overflow

```
     static uint32_t fstReaderVarint32(FILE *f)
     {
[12] unsigned char buf[5];
     unsigned char *mem = buf;
     uint32_t rc = 0;
     int ch;

     do
             {
             ch = fgetc(f);
[13]         *(mem++) = ch;
[14]         } while(ch & 0x80);
     mem--;

     for(;;)
             {
             rc <<= 7;
             rc |= (uint32_t)(*mem & 0x7f);
             if(mem == buf)
                     {
                     break;
                     }
             mem--;
             }

     return(rc);
     }

```

`fstReaderVarint32` reads a variable integer using LEB128 encoding from the input file `f`. A 5-byte buffer is allocated on the stack at [12], and the do-while loop reads each byte in the input file and puts it in `buf` [13] (via the temporary variable `mem`), stopping only when the MSB of the byte read from file is 1 [14].

This means that the stop condition of the loop is fully under attacker control, and this function can be exploited to write out-of-bounds off the stack variable `buf`, leading to arbitrary code execution. For example, it’s enough to write a crafted field like “FF FF FF FF FF FF FF” to write 2 bytes outside the bounds of `buf`.

#### CVE-2023-35703 - fstReaderVarint64 stack-based buffer overflow

```
     static uint64_t fstReaderVarint64(FILE *f)
     {
[12] unsigned char buf[16];
     unsigned char *mem = buf;
     uint64_t rc = 0;
     int ch;

     do
             {
             ch = fgetc(f);
[13]         *(mem++) = ch;
[14]         } while(ch & 0x80);
     mem--;

     for(;;)
             {
             rc <<= 7;
             rc |= (uint64_t)(*mem & 0x7f);
             if(mem == buf)
                     {
                     break;
                     }
             mem--;
             }

     return(rc);
     }

```

`fstReaderVarint64` reads a variable integer using LEB128 encoding from the input file `f`. A 16-byte buffer is allocated on the stack at [12], and the do-while loop reads each byte in the input file and puts it in `buf` [13] (via the temporary variable `mem`), stopping only when the MSB of the byte read from file is 1 [14].

This means that the stop condition of the loop is fully under attacker control, and this function can be exploited to write out-of-bounds off the stack variable `buf`, leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### CVE-2023-35704 - fstReaderVarint32WithSkip stack-based buffer overflow

```
     static uint32_t fstReaderVarint32WithSkip(FILE *f, uint32_t *skiplen)
     {
[12] unsigned char buf[5];
     unsigned char *mem = buf;
     uint32_t rc = 0;
     int ch;

     do
             {
             ch = fgetc(f);
[13]         *(mem++) = ch;
[14]         } while(ch & 0x80);
     *skiplen = mem - buf;
     mem--;

     for(;;)
             {
             rc <<= 7;
             rc |= (uint32_t)(*mem & 0x7f);
             if(mem == buf)
                     {
                     break;
                     }
             mem--;
             }

     return(rc);
     }

```

`fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` reads a variable integer using LEB128 encoding from the input file `f`. A 5-byte buffer is allocated on the stack at [12], and the do-while loop reads each byte in the input file and puts it in `buf` [13] (via the temporary variable `mem`), stopping only when the MSB of the byte read from file is 1 [14].

This means that the stop condition of the loop is fully under attacker control, and this function can be exploited to write out-of-bounds off the stack variable `buf`, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The issue in `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` can be triggered when parsing the FST’s VCDATA section. The parsing happens inside the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function:

```
     ...
     for (i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
         if (chain_table[i]) {
             int process_idx = i / 8;
             int process_bit = i & 7;

             if (xc->process_mask[process_idx] & (1 << process_bit)) {
                 int rc = Z_OK;
                 uint32_t val;
                 uint32_t skiplen;
                 uint32_t tdelta;

[15]             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, vc_start + chain_table[i], SEEK_SET);
[16]             val = fstReaderVarint32WithSkip(xc->f, &skiplen);
                 if (val) {
                     unsigned char *mu = mem_for_traversal + traversal_mem_offs; /* uncomp: dst */
                     unsigned char *mc;                                          /* comp:   src */
                     unsigned long destlen = val;
                     unsigned long sourcelen = chain_table_lengths[i];

                     if (mc_mem_len < chain_table_lengths[i]) {
                         free(mc_mem);
                         mc_mem = (unsigned char *)malloc(mc_mem_len = chain_table_lengths[i]);
                     }
                     mc = mc_mem;
     ...

```

At [15] the file cursor is placed at the start of the `VCDATA` section, offset depending on `chain_table`. To trigger this issue, it’s enough to start the `VCDATA` section with a crafted varint as described previously (a long sequence of “FF FF FF FF FF FF FF” is enough).
