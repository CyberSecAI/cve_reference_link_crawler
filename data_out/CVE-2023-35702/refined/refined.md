Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `fstReaderVarint32` function, which is responsible for reading variable-length integers encoded using LEB128 format from a file. The function uses a fixed-size stack buffer to store the read bytes, but does not properly validate the length of the encoded integer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `fstReaderVarint32` function allocates a 5-byte buffer on the stack. The loop that reads bytes into this buffer continues as long as the most significant bit of the read byte is set. An attacker can control the number of bytes written to the buffer and cause a buffer overflow by providing a sequence of bytes where the most significant bit is always set.
- **Lack of input validation:** The function does not validate the length of the variable-length integer before copying it to the fixed-size stack buffer, making the overflow possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite stack data, including return addresses, and gain control of the program's execution flow. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted .fst file:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted `.fst` file. An attacker can create a malicious `.fst` file containing a long LEB128 encoded sequence of bytes, designed to overflow the stack buffer within the `fstReaderVarint32` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a `.fst` file.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the crafted .fst file using the vulnerable GTKWave application. This could be achieved through social engineering or by distributing the file via email or other channels.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in GTKWave versions prior to 3.3.118.
- Similar vulnerabilities are present in the `fstReaderVarint64` (CVE-2023-35703) and `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` (CVE-2023-35704) functions which are also related to LEB128 parsing.
- The provided crash information demonstrates a stack buffer overflow in `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip`, showing the vulnerability's impact in practice.
