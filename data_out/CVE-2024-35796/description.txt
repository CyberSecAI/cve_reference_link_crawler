In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ll_temac: platform_get_resource replaced by wrong function

The function platform_get_resource was replaced with
devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname and is called using 0 as name.

This eventually ends up in platform_get_resource_byname in the call
stack, where it causes a null pointer in strcmp.

	if (type == resource_type(r) && !strcmp(r->name, name))

It should have been replaced with devm_platform_ioremap_resource.
