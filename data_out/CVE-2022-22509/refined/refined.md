- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect privilege assignment in the user management of Phoenix Contact FL SWITCH 2xxx series devices. An unprivileged user logged in via the SSH CLI is assigned to the admin role, regardless of their configured access role.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269), Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can elevate their privileges and gain full control of the device, potentially leading to complete takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via SSH CLI login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account (even with low privileges) and network access to the device to log in via SSH.
