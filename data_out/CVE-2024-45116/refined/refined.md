The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45116.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then stored and executed when other users view the affected content.
