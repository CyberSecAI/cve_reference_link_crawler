- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A SEH based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in the RaidenFTPD v2.4.4005 software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs in the "Server name" field during the step-by-step setup wizard. This is triggered when the input into the server name field is larger than what is allocated and overwrites Structured Exception Handler (SEH) records on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A local attacker can execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by overwriting the SEH chain, allowing the attacker to redirect the program's execution flow to shellcode. The exploit provided demonstrates execution of `calc.exe`.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the application's setup wizard. Specifically, the 'Server name' field is the entry point for this exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local to the machine to access the RaidenFTPD application. They require the ability to input data into the 'Server name' field.
