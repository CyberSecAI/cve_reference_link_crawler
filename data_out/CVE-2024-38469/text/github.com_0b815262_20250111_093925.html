### **[Hebing123](/Hebing123)** commented [Jun 3, 2024](#issue-2330789142)

| Summary A reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in iBarn v1.5 due to improper sanitization of the `$search` parameter in the `html/index.php`, `html/pay.php`, and `html/own.php` files. Although the `htmlspecialchars` function is used to encode HTML entities, the developers utilized the flag `ENT_NOQUOTES`, which does not encode single or double quotes, leading to the vulnerability. Details The misuse of the htmlspecialchars function allows the injection of JavaScript code into the search field, which can be exploited for XSS attacks.  html/index.php:  ```    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="search" name="search" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['search'], ENT_NOQUOTES); ?>" placeholder="<?php echo t('搜你想要'); ?>">  ```  html/pay.php:  ```    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="search" name="search" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['search'], ENT_NOQUOTES); ?>" placeholder="搜你想要">  ```  html/own.php:  ```    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="search" name="search" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['search'], ENT_NOQUOTES); ?>" placeholder="<?php echo t('搜你想要'); ?>">  ``` Proof of Concept (PoC) ``` http(s)://ip:port/index.php?search=1%22%20onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)%20bad=%221  ```  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/66168888/336037556-c8d70300-1da7-42cf-8ad9-c4e9cf603bc0.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.1xa58P3TE_oVskPDaCYD9FXNkAgAO5vcefQtKAQr8kk) Differentiation from [CVE-2024-26471](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjr7-7f86-j28r "CVE-2024-26471") This vulnerability is distinct from [CVE-2024-26471](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjr7-7f86-j28r "CVE-2024-26471") as it specifically targets the $search parameter processed through the htmlspecialchars function and then bypasses filtering. Although [CVE-2024-26471](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjr7-7f86-j28r "CVE-2024-26471") only mentioned that the search field in `html/offer.php` lacks any filtering, our investigation revealed that several other pages (`shareme.php`, `recycle.php`, `collection.php`, `pub.php`, `myshare.php`) also do not filter the `$search` parameter, leading to multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. |
