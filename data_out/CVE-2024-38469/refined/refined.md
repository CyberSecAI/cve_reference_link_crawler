Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `htmlspecialchars` function in `html/index.php`, `html/pay.php`, and `html/own.php` files. The developers used the `ENT_NOQUOTES` flag, which does not encode single or double quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `$search` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, which might lead to session hijacking.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The injected script could redirect the user to a malicious website.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker might be able to access and steal sensitive user data.
- **Website Defacement:** The injected code could alter the appearance of the web page, defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the `$search` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable pages (`index.php`, `pay.php`, `own.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload and send it to a victim user.
- **User Interaction:** The user must click on the malicious link in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the `htmlspecialchars` function is used with `ENT_NOQUOTES`.
- The vulnerable code snippets are found in the input fields of `html/index.php`, `html/pay.php`, and `html/own.php`:
   ```php
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="search" name="search" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['search'], ENT_NOQUOTES); ?>" placeholder="<?php echo t('搜你想要'); ?>">
    ```
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) URL is provided:
    ```
    http(s)://ip:port/index.php?search=1%22%20onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)%20bad=%221
    ```
This PoC shows how to inject javascript code through the `search` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- It is explicitly stated that this vulnerability is different from CVE-2024-26471. The report also mentions that several other pages (`shareme.php`, `recycle.php`, `collection.php`, `pub.php`, `myshare.php`) do not filter the `$search` parameter, leading to additional XSS vulnerabilities.
