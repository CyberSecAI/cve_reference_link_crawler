{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DVDFab Player/PlayerFab application serves a browseable media library over HTTP. When a user requests to download a debugging log, the application's HTML user interface generates a request that includes the path to the log file. This path can be manipulated by an attacker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Read: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the file path provided by the user when requesting a debugging log, allowing an attacker to specify any path on the system that the user running the application has read access to."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where DVDFab Player/PlayerFab is running. This could include sensitive data, configuration files, or other confidential information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Tampering with browser's request: Modifying the request issued by the HTML interface in the browser.",
       "Direct HTTP GET request: Sending a direct HTTP GET request to the application's server with a manipulated file path."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the machine running the DVDFab Player/PlayerFab application on port 32080. No authentication is required. The attacker must also know the IP address of the target machine running the application.",
    "affected_products": [
      "DVDFab 12 Player versions 6.2.1.0 - 6.2.1.1",
      "PlayerFab 7.0.0.0 - 7.0.0.5"
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.  A proof of concept using curl is provided, showing how to exploit the vulnerability to read system.ini file."
