The provided content is related to CVE-2019-6693.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded symmetric key to encrypt password data within the CLI configuration of FortiOS, FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded cryptographic key: The core weakness is the use of a static, pre-defined key for encryption, instead of a unique, randomly generated or user-defined key.
- Insecure storage of sensitive data: Sensitive information like credentials was encrypted using this hardcoded key, which is easily discoverable by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker with access to the CLI configuration or a CLI backup file can decrypt the sensitive information. This includes credentials of type "ENC" within the system.
- Loss of confidentiality: The primary impact is the disclosure of encrypted sensitive data, potentially allowing unauthorized access to systems and services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to CLI configuration: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the CLI configuration through various means. Examples:
    - Directly accessing the CLI interface.
    - Obtaining backup files.
    - Stealing configuration data posted on public forums for troubleshooting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to either the CLI configuration data or a backup file containing the encrypted information. 
- Knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic key is needed to decrypt the information, however this key is publicly known due to the nature of the vulnerability.
