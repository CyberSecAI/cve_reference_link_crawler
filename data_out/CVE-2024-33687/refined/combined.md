No. OMSR-2024-004_en (  1  /  3  )

in NJ/NX-series Machine Automation Controllers

Release date: May 27, 2024

OMRON  Corporation

■Overview

Insufficient  Verification  of  Data  Authenticity  (CWE-345)  vulnerability  exists  in  the  NJ/NX-

series Machine Automation Controllers. Due to this vulnerability, the controller product may

not be able to detect that the user program within the product has been tampered with.

The  products  and  versions  affected  by  this  vulnerability,  countermeasures,  mitigation  and

protection  measures  are  shown  below.  Make  sure  to  implement  these  recommended

mitigations and protections to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Please

check  countermeasures  shown  below  in  this  document  and  implement  appropriate

countermeasures.

■Affected products

Affected products and versions are below.

-  Machine Automation Controller NJ-series, all versions

-  Machine Automation Controller NX-series, all versions

■Description

Due to the Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345) vulnerability which exists

in the NJ/NX-series Machine Automation Controllers, the products may not be able to detect

that the user program within the product has been tampered with.

■CVSS Scores

Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)

CVE-2024- 33687

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N Base Score 4.8

■Countermeasures

The countermeasures against the vulnerability can be taken by using the followings.

-  User Program Transfer with No Restoration Information

-  Normally, when you transfer the user program from the Sysmac Studio to the CPU Unit,

information  is  transferred  to  restore  it.  This  function  does  not  transfer  information  for

restoration. That makes it impossible to tamper with the user program.

Please  refer  to  the  “User  Program  Transfer  with  No  Restoration  Information”  in  the

No. OMSR-2024-004_en (  2  /  3  )

manual to know details.

■Mitigations and Protections

OMRON recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize

the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.

1.  Anti-virus protection

Protect  any  PC  with  access  to  the  control  system  against  malware  and  ensure

installation  and  maintenance  of  up-to-date  commercial  grade  anti-virus  software

protection.

2.  Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

-  Minimize connection of control systems and equipment to open networks, so that

untrusted devices will be unable to access them.

-

Implement  firewalls  (by  shutting  down  unused  communications  ports,  limiting

communications hosts) and isolate them from the IT network.

-  Use  a  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  for  remote  access  to  control  systems  and

equipment.

-  Use strong passwords and change them frequently.

-

Install  physical  controls  so  that  only  authorized  personnel  can  access  control

systems and equipment.

-  Scan virus to ensure safety of any USB drives or similar devices before connecting

them to systems and devices.

-  Enforce  multifactor  authentication  to  all  devices  with  remote  access  to  control

systems and equipment whenever possible.

3.  Data input and output protection

Validation  processing  such  as  backup  and  range  check  to  cope  with  unintentional

modification of input/output data to control systems and devices.

4.  Data recovery

Periodical data backup and maintenance to prepare for data loss.
