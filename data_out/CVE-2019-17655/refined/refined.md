Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-17655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Cleartext storage of SSL VPN session information in a file or on disk. This falls under CWE-313: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive information such as logged-in SSL VPN user's credentials are not encrypted and stored in cleartext within session files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the session file can retrieve the logged-in SSL VPN user's credentials. This results in information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to read the session file stored on the targeted device's system. This requires an initial foothold.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a capability to read system files on the target device, typically achieved via exploiting another vulnerability that allows arbitrary file read, or some sort of system compromise.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the VPN to exploit this vulnerability, but needs access to the server.
