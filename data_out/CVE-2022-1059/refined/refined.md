- **System manipulation:** A successful attacker could modify the content of a web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted URL that contains malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
