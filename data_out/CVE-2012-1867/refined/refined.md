Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-1867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Windows kernel-mode drivers handle TrueType font loading. Specifically, the issue is a failure to properly allocate memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability involves an integer overflow related to font resource refcounts. This overflow occurs during the allocation of memory for font handling within the kernel.
*   **Improper Memory Allocation:** The root cause is a memory management issue that occurs during the process of loading and handling TrueType fonts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:**  With kernel-mode access, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attack involves executing a specially crafted application designed to trigger the integer overflow and improper memory allocation during TrueType font loading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log on to the target system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log on locally to the system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a malicious application that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is located in `win32k.sys`, which is a kernel-mode device driver that handles window displays, screen output, input, and the Graphics Device Interface (GDI).
* The provided document also notes that Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and there were no reports of exploitation in the wild when the security bulletin was released.
