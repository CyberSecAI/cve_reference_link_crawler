{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The rbtree lazy garbage collection during insertion in the netfilter module might incorrectly collect an end interval element that has just been added within the same transaction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of interval elements during garbage collection in netfilter's rbtree implementation."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability may lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption due to premature removal of recently added interval elements.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation requires inserting and deleting interval elements in the netfilter rbtree. Specific conditions must be met to trigger the incorrect garbage collection.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to insert and delete interval elements in netfilter's rbtree, possibly through crafted network packets or other means of interacting with the netfilter subsystem. The attacker would need to know the specific conditions which cause the race to trigger it"
