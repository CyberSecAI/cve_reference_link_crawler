Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `tdhttpd` service of the Tenda AX1803 router.
- The overflow occurs within the `set_name_with_mac` function, specifically when handling the `devName` parameter from a `SetOnlineDevName` request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of input validation:** The `sprintf` function used to copy the `devName` parameter into a local buffer (`v9`) does not check the length of the input.
- **Fixed-size buffer:** The `v9` buffer has a fixed size of 256 bytes.
- **Unsafe string copy:**  The use of `sprintf` with format string `"%s;1"` without length limits allows attacker-controlled input to overwrite the stack when `devName` exceeds the buffer's capacity

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack. This allows hijacking the control flow of the program, enabling the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Root Shell:** The attacker can obtain a stable root shell on the router through a carefully crafted payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/goform/SetOnlineDevName`.
- **`devName` Parameter:** The `devName` parameter within the POST request is the vector through which the malicious payload is introduced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint. The provided example includes a `Cookie` header with the `password` field.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router, which is typically achieved by being connected to the same network or having a way to send HTTP requests to the router's IP address.
