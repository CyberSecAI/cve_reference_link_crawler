The content relates to CVE-2024-45294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the XSLT transforms performed by various components of `org.hl7.fhir.core`. These transforms are susceptible to XML external entity (XXE) injections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of an XXE vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML containing a DTD tag such as `<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]>`. This malicious DTD can lead to the disclosure of data from the host system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read data from the host system. This could include sensitive information depending on the accessible files on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote. The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a crafted XML file containing a malicious DTD when `org.hl7.fhir.core` is used in a context where external XML data is processed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges and requires no user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to submit an XML file to a vulnerable system. The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N` describes this.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `org.hl7.fhir.core` prior to 6.3.23
- The vulnerability is described with a CVSS v3 score of 8.6 (High)
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-611.
- The vulnerability affects several modules of `org.hl7.fhir.core`, namely `org.hl7.fhir.dstu2016may`, `org.hl7.fhir.dstu3`, `org.hl7.fhir.r4`, `org.hl7.fhir.r4b`, `org.hl7.fhir.r5`, and `org.hl7.fhir.utilities`.
