- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied input for the "name" parameter when creating a team, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker creates a new team using the vulnerable "name" parameter, embedding a malicious JavaScript payload within it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a subscriber-level account or higher on the WordPress site. They also need to be able to access the team creation functionality provided by the vulnerable plugin.
