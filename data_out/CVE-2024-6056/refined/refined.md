{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The server provides distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses during password reset attempts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Email enumeration vulnerability through observable response discrepancy in the forgot password functionality.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can enumerate valid email addresses registered on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending password reset requests with different email addresses and observing the server's responses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the forgot password functionality of the application."
