SECURITY BULLETIN AVEVA-2021-002
Title
System Platform - Vulnerabilities in AutoBuild Chaining to Arbitrary Code Execution or Denial of Service

Rating
High

Published By
AVEVA Software Security Response Center

Overview
AVEVA Software, LLC. (“AVEVA”) has created a security update to address vulnerabilities in AutoBuild.
The vulnerable AutoBuild component is present in AVEVA™ System Platform versions 2017 through
2020 R2 P01 (inclusive). The vulnerabilities, if exploited and chained together, could allow a malicious
entity to execute arbitrary code with system privileges or cause a denial of service.

Recommendations
AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their
operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

The AutoBuild service is intended to be used only on the GR Node of System Platform during
configuration. It should be disabled in all Runtime nodes using the Windows Service applet.
Furthermore, if the AutoBuild functionality is not utilized on the GR Node, the AutoBuild service can also
be disabled on the GR Node as an alternative mitigation that does not require patching.

Customers who need to continually use the AutoBuild functionality and cannot disable it in System
Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 (inclusive) are affected by the vulnerabilities and should
first upgrade to one of the System Platform versions listed below, then apply the corresponding security
update:

Version

NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS v3) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
vulnerabilities.  CVSS v3 produces a numerical score as well as a textual representation of that score
reflecting the severity of a vulnerability.  Scores range from 0.0 (no impact) to a maximum of 10.0
(critical impact with minimal effort to exploit). For additional information please refer to the CVSS v3.1
specifications.
