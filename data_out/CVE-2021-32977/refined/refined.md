- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software does not properly verify cryptographic signatures for data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature (CWE-347).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with system privileges or cause a denial-of-service condition (if chained with other vulnerabilities).
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitable from an adjacent network with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges.
