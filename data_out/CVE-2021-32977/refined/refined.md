Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an improper verification of cryptographic signatures in the AutoBuild component of AVEVA System Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Digital Signature:** The software does not properly verify the cryptographic signature of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The vulnerability is exploitable from an adjacent network.
- Low attack complexity

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires a privileged access (High privilege) to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- The vulnerable AutoBuild component is present in AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 (inclusive).
- The AutoBuild service is intended for use only on the GR Node of System Platform during configuration and should be disabled in all Runtime nodes.
- The vendor provides a security update to address the vulnerability.
- There are no known public exploits that specifically target this vulnerability.
