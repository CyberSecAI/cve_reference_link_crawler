- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `snquote` function within `src/mjs_json.c` at line 81, during JSON stringification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to incorrect buffer handling in the `snquote` function when processing specific inputs, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to program crashes or potentially enable further exploitation for code execution or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted JavaScript payload to the `JSON.stringify` function within the mjs JavaScript engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `JSON.stringify` function, such as through a malicious script that is executed by the mjs engine.
