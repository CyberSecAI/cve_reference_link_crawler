Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41451:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the "txt" parameter of the "AjaxNewsTicker" component when saving news items.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to the lack of proper input validation when saving a news item with the "txt" parameter. This allows the injection of malicious scripts into the news feed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in a victim's browser, which may lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the victim, or any other malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious javascript code within the "txt" parameter when creating or editing a news item through the admin interface.
- The victim is then targeted when viewing the news item containing the malicious javascript payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the admin interface where they can create or edit news items.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter, "txt"
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious payload.
- The victim must be tricked to view the content with the malicious code to activate the attack on their browser.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable component is "AjaxNewsTicker" version 1.0.5.
- The vulnerability lies within the `index.php` component in the admin interface, specifically when saving news.
- The payload used in the provided proof of concept is: `<img src=0 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`.
- The attacker can use a POST or GET request with the `requ` parameter to inject the payload.
