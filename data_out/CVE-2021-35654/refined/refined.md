  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation or handling in the EAS Console component of Oracle Essbase Administration Services.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the EAS Console. These include: improper authentication checks, which may allow unauthorized access; missing validation of user-supplied input, which may lead to XSS or other attacks; and insufficient authorization enforcement for certain actions"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the EAS Console, potentially leading to the manipulation of data, configuration changes, or other malicious activities. Depending on the specific vulnerability exploited, confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the system may be compromised.",
     "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote exploitation is possible via HTTP requests to the EAS Console. Some vulnerabilities may require prior authentication, while others do not."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network connectivity to the affected server and the ability to send HTTP requests. For some vulnerabilities, no prior authentication is needed; for others, valid credentials would be required. Some of the vulnerabilities could be exploited through user interaction if they involve a cross site scripting attack. "
