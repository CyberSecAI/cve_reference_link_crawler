- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly uses the `RID` parameter in a SQL query without any sanitization or filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability. The `deleteByIds` function in the DAO layer directly uses the `RID` parameter from the request to construct the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can obtain sensitive data from the database, potentially inject malicious code, and gain control of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious `RID` parameter and sending it to the `/admin/article/delete.do` API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the administrative backend of the application. They can then manipulate the `RID` parameter in the delete request to inject SQL.
