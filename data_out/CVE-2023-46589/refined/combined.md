Subject: CVE-2023-46589: Apache Tomcat: HTTP request smuggling via malformed
 trailer headers

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10
- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82
- Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 through 8.5.95

Description:

Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from
11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from
9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 did not correctly
parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header
size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single
request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11 onwards, 10.1.16
onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.

Package        : tomcat9
Version        : 9.0.31-1~deb10u11
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-46589
Debian Bug     : 1057082

Apache Tomcat 9, a Servlet and JSP engine, was vulnerable.

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability was present.
and Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers.
A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause
Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple requests leading to
the possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
9.0.31-1~deb10u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.

For the detailed security status of tomcat9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat9>
