Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-46589

**Root Cause:** Improper input validation in Apache Tomcat's handling of HTTP trailer headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Tomcat does not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers.
*   A trailer header exceeding the header size limit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Request smuggling: Tomcat treats a single request as multiple requests. This can allow an attacker to bypass security checks and potentially gain unauthorized access or modify data, especially when Tomcat is behind a reverse proxy.
*   Addition or modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Maliciously crafted HTTP requests with oversized trailer headers.
*   The attack is performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server, typically via a reverse proxy.
*   No specific user privileges are required; the vulnerability can be triggered remotely without authentication.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10
*   Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15
*   Apache Tomcat 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82
*   Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 through 8.5.95

**Patched Versions:**
*   Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M11 onwards
*   Apache Tomcat 10.1.16 onwards
*   Apache Tomcat 9.0.83 onwards
*   Apache Tomcat 8.5.96 onwards

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "important" severity.
*   NetApp products incorporate Apache Tomcat, but no NetApp products are listed as affected.
*   Debian LTS has issued a security update (DLA 3707-1) to address the vulnerability in tomcat9.
*   The vulnerability is publicly known.
