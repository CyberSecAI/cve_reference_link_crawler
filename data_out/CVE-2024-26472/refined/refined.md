Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-26472

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- The `create-new-pwd.php` file in KLiK SocialMediaWebsite version 1.0.1 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `selector` and `validator` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application reflects unsanitized user-provided data back to the user's browser, allowing the execution of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a user.
- This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies and sensitive information
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the `selector` or `validator` parameters of `create-new-pwd.php`.
- When a user clicks on the crafted URL or accesses the link through other means, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and convince a user to click or otherwise access the URL, likely through social engineering or other means.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special access to the system.
