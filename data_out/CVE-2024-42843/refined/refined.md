- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `feed.php` file of the Online Examination System Project in Php version 1.0.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization for the 'subject' parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering.
- Comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SQL code injection via the 'subject' parameter in the `feed.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable `feed.php` file.
- No login is required.
