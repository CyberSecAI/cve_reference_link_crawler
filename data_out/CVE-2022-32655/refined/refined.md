- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the Wi-Fi driver leading to undefined behavior due to incorrect error handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20), incorrect error handling, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation of the Wi-Fi driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
