How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

This blog post is about vulnerabilities in Ninja Forms plugin vulnerabilities. If you’re a Ninja Forms user, please update the plugin to at least version **3.6.26**.

**Patchstack Developer and Business users are protected from the vulnerability.** You can also sign up for the [Patchstack Community plan](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) to be notified about vulnerabilities as soon as they become disclosed.

For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/) for hosting companies.

## About the Ninja Forms plugin

The plugin [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/) versions **3.6.25** and below, free version), which has over 900,000 active installations is known as the more popular forms builder plugin in WordPress. This plugin is developed by Saturday Drive.

![vulnerabilities in Ninja Forms](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-9-1024x332.png)

This plugin is a free form builder plugin for WordPress that enables us to build just about any type of form we could imagine. Ranging from simple contact forms to event registrations, file uploads, payments, and more.

## The security vulnerability

This plugin suffers from multiple vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is a POST-based reflected XSS. This vulnerability could allow any unauthenticated user to steal sensitive information to, in this case, privilege escalation on the WordPress site by tricking privileged users into visiting the crafted website. The described vulnerability was fixed in version **3.6.26** and assigned **CVE-2023-37979**.

The second and third vulnerabilities are broken access controls on the form submissions export feature. This vulnerability allows Subscriber and Contributor role users to export all of the Ninja Forms submissions on a WordPress site. The described vulnerability was also fixed in version **3.6.26** and assigned **CVE-2023-38393** and **CVE-2023-38386**.

### Reflected XSS

The initial entry point of this vulnerability exists in the `route` function:

```
public function route()
{
	register_shutdown_function( array( $this, 'shutdown' ) );

	$method = strtolower( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] );

	/*
		* Request Method Override
		* Allows for a POST request to function as another Request Method
		*   by passing a `method_override` value as a request parameter.
		* For example, some servers do not support the DELETE request method.
		*/
	if( 'post' == $method and isset( $_REQUEST[ 'method_override' ] ) ){
		$method = sanitize_text_field( $_REQUEST[ 'method_override' ] );
	}

	if( ! method_exists( $this, $method ) ){
		$this->_errors[] = esc_html__( 'Endpoint does not exist.', 'ninja-forms' );
		$this->_respond();
	}
	/**
	 * This call get the $_REQUEST info for the call(post, get, etc.)
	 * being called.
	 */
	$request_data = $this->get_request_data();

	try {
		$data = $this->$method($request_data);
		$this->_respond( $data );
-------------------------- CUT HERE --------------------------
```

The above `route` function could be called from an ajax action named `nf_batch_process`. Notice on the function that we could override the `$method` using `$_REQUEST[ 'method_override' ]` parameter if the original HTTP method performed is a POST request.

The code then will call `this->$method()` with `$request_data` as input parameter. The `$request_data` value is constructed from `get_request_data` function :

```
protected function get_request_data()
{
    $request_data = array();

    if (isset($_REQUEST['batch_type']) && $_REQUEST['batch_type']) {
        $request_data['batch_type'] = WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['batch_type']);
    }

    if (isset($_REQUEST['data']) && $_REQUEST['data']) {
        // @TODO: Find a way to safely sanitize this later.
        // sanitize_text_field overcorrects, breaking "actual" data.
        $request_data['data'] = $_REQUEST['data'];
    }

    if (isset($_REQUEST['security']) && $_REQUEST['security']) {
        $request_data['security'] = WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['security']);
    }

    if (isset($_REQUEST['action']) && $_REQUEST['action']) {
        $request_data['action'] = WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['action']);
    }

    return $request_data;
}
```

The interesting part is which function could we call on the `$method` variable. Turns out that we could call the `_respond` function itself which originally act as a wrapper function to output data :

```
protected function _respond( $data = array() )
{
    if( empty( $data ) ){
        $data = $this->_data;
    }

    if( isset( $this->_data['debug'] ) ) {
        $this->_debug = array_merge( $this->_debug, $this->_data[ 'debug' ] );
    }

    if( isset( $this->_data['errors'] ) && $this->_data[ 'errors' ] ) {
        $this->_errors = array_merge( $this->_errors, $this->_data[ 'errors' ] );
    }

    // allow for accessing and acting on $data before responding
    do_action( 'ninja_forms_before_response', $data );

    $response = array( 'data' => $data, 'errors' => $this->_errors, 'debug' => $this->_debug );

    echo wp_json_encode( $response );

    wp_die(); // this is required to terminate immediately and return a proper response
}
```

Notice that the function will output `$response` that could be constructed from our `$data` variable with `echo wp_json_encode()`.

This will still make HTTP response output as text/html. Looking back at the `get_request_data` function, we could inject the XSS payload via `$_REQUEST['data']` since there is no sanitization or escaping implemented.

### Subscriber+ Broken Access Control

The underlying vulnerability exist in the `processing` function:

```
public function processing() {

	// Get our passed arguments. These come from the querysting of the processing page.
	if ( isset ( $_REQUEST['args'] ) ) {
		$this->args = WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['args']);
		if ( isset ( $this->args['redirect'] ) ) {
			if( wp_validate_redirect( $this->args['redirect'] ) ){
				$this->redirect = wp_sanitize_redirect( $this->args['redirect'] );
			}
		}
	} else {
		$this->args = array();
	}

	// Get our current step.
	$this->step = isset ( $_REQUEST['step'] )? esc_html( $_REQUEST['step'] ) : 'loading';

	// Get our total steps
	$this->total_steps = isset ( $_REQUEST['total_steps'] )? esc_html( $_REQUEST['total_steps'] ) : 0;

	// If our step is loading, then we need to return how many total steps there are along with the next step, which is 1.
	if ( 'loading' == $this->step ) {
		$return = $this->loading();
		if ( ! isset ( $return['step'] ) ) {
			$saved_step = get_user_option( 'nf_step_processing_' . $this->action . '_step' );
			if ( ! empty ( $saved_step ) ) {
				$this->step = $saved_step;
			} else {
				$this->step = 1;
			}

			$return['step'] = $this->step;
		}
		if ( ! isset ( $return['complete'] ) ) {
			$return['complete'] = false;
		}
	} else { // We aren't on the loading step, so do our processing.
		$return = $this->step();
-------------------------- CUT HERE --------------------------
```

The `processing` function is set to be a function handler of `nf_download_all_subs` ajax action and there is no proper permission check. The function will call `$this->step()` function which will export all of the submissions to the `$this->args['filename']` we specified.

### Contributor+ Broken Access Control

The underlying vulnerability exists in the `export_listen` function:

```
-------------------------- CUT HERE --------------------------
if (isset ($_REQUEST['download_file']) && !empty($_REQUEST['download_file'])) {

    // Open our download all file
    $filename = esc_html($_REQUEST['download_file']);

    $upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();

    $file_path = trailingslashit($upload_dir['path']) . $filename . '.csv';

    if (file_exists($file_path)) {
        $myfile = file_get_contents($file_path);
    } else {
        $redirect = esc_url_raw(remove_query_arg(array('download_file', 'download_all')));
        wp_redirect($redirect);
        die();
    }

    unlink($file_path);

    $form_name = Ninja_Forms()->form(absint($_REQUEST['form_id']))->get()->get_setting('title');
    $form_name = sanitize_title($form_name);

    $today = date('Y-m-d', current_time('timestamp'));

    $filename = apply_filters('ninja_forms_download_all_filename', $form_name . '-all-subs-' . $today);

    header('Content-type: application/csv');
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $filename . '.csv"');
    header('Pragma: no-cache');
    header('Expires: 0');

    echo $myfile;

    die();
}
-------------------------- CUT HERE --------------------------
```

The function is set to be a function handler of `[load-edit.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/load-pagenow/)` hook which could be triggered when a user for example visits the `/wp-admin/edit.php` endpoint. Since there is no proper permission check, by default, user with the minimum role of Contributor could export form submissions.

## The patch

For the reflected XSS issue, the vendor decided to restrict which method the user could access from the function. This patch is enough to prevent the user from directly calling the `_respond` function to trigger the XSS. The [patch](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2933997/ninja-forms/tags/3.6.26/includes/AJAX/REST/Controller.php?old=2238469&old_path=ninja-forms%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2FAJAX%2FREST%2FController.php) can be seen below :

![vulnerabilities in Ninja Forms](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-10-1024x295.png)

For the Subscriber+ broken access control, adding a permission check should also fix the reported issue. The [patch](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=%2Fninja-forms%2Ftags%2F3.6.25&old=&new_path=%2Fninja-forms%2Ftags%2F3.6.26&new=&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file12) can be seen below :

![vulnerabilities in Ninja Forms](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1024x329.png)

For the Contributor+ broken access control, adding a permission check should also fix the reported issue. The [patch](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2933997/ninja-forms/tags/3.6.26/includes/Admin/Menus/Submissions.php?old=2866556&old_path=ninja-forms%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2FAdmin%2FMenus%2FSubmissions.php) can be seen below :

![vulnerabilities in Ninja Forms](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-13-1024x307.png)
## Conclusion

In some cases, a plugin or theme code needs to call a certain function or class from user supplied string. Always try to check and restrict which function or class the user can directly call. Also, pay extra attention to an export data action and always implement permission or access control checks to the related functions.
