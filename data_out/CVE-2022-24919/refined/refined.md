{
  "CVE-2022-24919": {
    "description": "An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code inside it for graphsâ€™ page and send it to other users. The payload can be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is changed periodically and is difficult to predict.",
    "root_cause": "The Zabbix frontend does not properly sanitize input in the graph configuration window, allowing for reflected XSS.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Reflected XSS"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious code can access the same objects as the rest of the web page and can modify the content displayed to the victim during social engineering attacks.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript is sent to a user via social engineering techniques."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in Zabbix and must have a way to send the crafted link to a victim. The CSRF token of the victim needs to be known for full exploitability, although this is difficult as it changes periodically."
