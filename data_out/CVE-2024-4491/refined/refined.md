Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `formGetDiagnoseInfo` function.
- The `cmdinput` parameter within this function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting data on the stack and redirecting the execution flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via the `cmdinput` parameter of the `formGetDiagnoseInfo` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input to the affected function that exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- The attacker needs to access the vulnerable endpoint or API that calls the `formGetDiagnoseInfo` function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerable firmware version is identified as Tenda i21 V1.0.0.14(4656).
- The vulnerability is located in the `formGetDiagnoseInfo` function.
- The `cmdinput` parameter is the specific input that is exploited.
