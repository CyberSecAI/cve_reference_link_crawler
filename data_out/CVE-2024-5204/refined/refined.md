Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Swiss Toolkit For WP plugin storing custom data (specifically, encrypted tokens and user IDs used for generating login URLs) in WordPress post metadata without using an underscore prefix. This makes the metadata publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin uses a publicly accessible post meta key (`bdstfw_encrypted_token` and `bdstfw_current_login_userId` and other similar meta keys without underscore prefix) to store sensitive data that is used in the authentication process.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By directly accessing and manipulating the post metadata, an attacker can bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to any user account, including administrator accounts.
- **Complete Site Compromise:** With administrator access, an attacker can take complete control of the affected WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a special URL with an encrypted token from the metadata, which can be accessed due to the absence of the underscore prefix.
- They access the login url with the `sk` parameter
- The plugin checks the `sk` parameter value against the stored token from the metadata, and then uses the stored user ID also obtained from the metadata to log in the attacker

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor level permissions (or higher) which allows them to edit posts and thus access the vulnerable metadata.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin**: The attacker must know that the plugin is installed and how it generates the login URLs.
