The provided content describes a vulnerability in emlog pro 2.3.x related to file uploads.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of filtering and analysis of uploaded zip file contents during the plugin installation process. Specifically, the application doesn't validate the type or content of files within the zip archive, allowing for arbitrary file uploads. Additionally, the vulnerability requires that the folder in the compressed package and the file name in the folder are the same.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unrestricted file upload: The system allows uploading of zip files without proper validation of their contents.
    - Lack of sanitization: After decompression, the system does not sanitize or analyze the extracted files before writing them to the server's file system. This includes a lack of filename sanitization
    - Predictable upload path: The uploaded files are placed in a predictable location within the `content/plugins` directory, making them easily accessible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to upload arbitrary PHP files to the server and execute them, leading to complete compromise of the system, or 'getshel'.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the plugin installation functionality located at `admin/views/plugin.php`. An attacker uploads a specially crafted zip file containing a malicious PHP file. The zip is then decompressed without sanitization, leading to the malicious file being placed on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the emlog pro system to access the plugin installation feature.
