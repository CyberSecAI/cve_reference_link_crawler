{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Technicolor TG670 DSL Gateway Router includes hard-coded service accounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hard-coded credentials for service accounts that allow full administrative access to the device.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can gain full administrative control of the router, modify settings, and use it in unexpected ways.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited over the WAN interface (e.g., the internet) via HTTP, SSH, or TELNET if Remote Administration is enabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the default username and password for the hard-coded service account, and remote administration must be enabled on the router."
