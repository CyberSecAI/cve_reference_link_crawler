- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the component process security checks within IBM UrbanCode Deploy. These checks can incorrectly grant read-level access to users who should not have it, specifically when the process is owned by a Component Template and the endpoint performs multiple validations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization leading to unauthorized access to component processes. The vulnerability exists because of multiple validations that are not properly handled.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with unauthorized access could potentially gain read access to component processes that they are not intended to access. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, and further attacks depending on the processes exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability in the component process security checks. The vulnerability is triggered when a component process is owned by a Component Template and multiple endpoint validations are performed.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the vulnerable application (IBM UrbanCode Deploy) to take advantage of this issue. The attacker must not have the intended access rights for the processes, and must attempt to access them.
