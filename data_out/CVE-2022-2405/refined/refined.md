- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization leading to broken access control. Specifically, any authenticated user, including subscribers, can delete arbitrary popups.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete arbitrary popups from the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `delete_popup` action and a popup ID (`bid`), an attacker can delete the specified popup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (even a subscriber).
