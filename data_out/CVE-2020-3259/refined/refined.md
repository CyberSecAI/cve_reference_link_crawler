- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer tracking issue occurs when the software parses invalid URLs requested from the web services interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to improper handling of crafted GET requests to the web services interface, leading to memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve memory contents on an affected device, potentially disclosing confidential information such as web cookies for AnyConnect and WebVPN, usernames, email addresses, certificates, and heap addresses.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request to the web services interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device's web services interface; no authentication is required.
