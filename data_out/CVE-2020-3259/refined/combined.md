The vulnerability is due to a buffer tracking issue when the software parses invalid URLs that are requested from the web services interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to the web services interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve memory contents, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.  **Note:** This vulnerability affects only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-info-disclose-9eJtycMB>  This advisory is part of the May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 12 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73830).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software with a vulnerable AnyConnect or WebVPN configuration. Cisco ASA Software In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA Software features that are vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If the device is running a vulnerable release and is configured for one of these features, it is vulnerable.       | Cisco ASA Software Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Clientless SSL VPN | webvpn enable |      Cisco FTD Software In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD Software features that are vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If the device is running a vulnerable release and is configured for one of these features, it is vulnerable.       | Cisco FTD Software Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)1,2 | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | webvpn enable |       1. Remote Access VPN features are enabled by using **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) or by using **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).2. Remote Access VPN features are first supported in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Details  * The confidential information that could be disclosed is memory on the system heap. The contents of this memory can be different on each system and at different times but can include web cookies for the AnyConnect and WebVPN features, usernames, email addresses, certificates, and actual heap addresses.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.  **Cisco ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability | First Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 9.51 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.51 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.6 | 9.6.4.41 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.71 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.8 | 9.8.4.20 | 9.8.4.20 |   | 9.9 | 9.9.2.67 | 9.9.2.67 |   | 9.10 | 9.10.1.40 | 9.10.1.40 |   | 9.12 | 9.12.3.9 | 9.12.3.9 |   | 9.13 | 9.13.1.10 | 9.13.1.10 |   | 9.14 | Not vulnerable. | Not vulnerable. |      1.
