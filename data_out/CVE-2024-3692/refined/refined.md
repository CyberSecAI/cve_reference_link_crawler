- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate the `htmlTag` option in several of its blocks before outputting it back on a page/post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with the Contributor role or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code into a post that will be executed when any user views the post. This can lead to various malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: A Contributor user injects malicious JavaScript code through the `htmlTag` option of a Gutenverse block within a post using the Code Editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in WordPress to create/edit posts. They also need to know that they can inject script via the `htmlTag` option.
