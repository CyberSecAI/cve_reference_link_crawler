- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LevelOne WBR-6012 router's web application relies solely on the client IP address for authentication, instead of using session tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the reliance on IP addresses for authentication (CWE-291). The web application stores the IP address of the most recent login and uses this as the sole check for authentication for future requests. This makes it trivial to bypass authentication by spoofing the IP of a logged in user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router's web interface, enabling them to access all pages and functionality, potentially leading to full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is over the network by sending HTTP requests to the web application with a spoofed IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and be able to spoof the IP address of a previously authenticated user.
