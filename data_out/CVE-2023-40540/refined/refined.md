Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-40540:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Non-Transparent Sharing of Microarchitectural Resources in some Intel(R) NUC BIOS firmware

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper isolation or control of shared microarchitectural resources within the Intel NUC BIOS firmware. This could allow unintended access or interference between different processes or components.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure. Specifically, a privileged user could potentially gain access to sensitive data through the improper sharing of microarchitectural resources.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must have privileged access on the system.
   - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system locally.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the vulnerability affects "some Intel(R) NUC BIOS firmware."
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.1, rated as Medium severity.
*   The CVSS vector string is  `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` which means:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker needs local access to the system.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** The attack requires specialized conditions.
    *   **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker needs to have administrative or privileged access.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required.
    *  **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** An exploited vulnerability stays in the affected component and does not spread to other parts of the system.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality (sensitive information can be accessed).
    *  **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact on integrity (no modification of data).
    *   **A:N (Availability: None):** There is no impact on availability.

* The advisory lists several specific Intel NUC product lines that are affected and provides links to BIOS updates that address the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was reported by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
