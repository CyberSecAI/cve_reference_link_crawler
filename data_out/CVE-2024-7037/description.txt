In version v0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, the endpoint /api/pipelines/upload is vulnerable to arbitrary file write and delete due to unsanitized file.filename concatenation with CACHE_DIR. This vulnerability allows attackers to overwrite and delete system files, potentially leading to remote code execution.
