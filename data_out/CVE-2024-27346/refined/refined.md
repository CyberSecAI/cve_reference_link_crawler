```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling PDF files. This leads to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file that, when opened, triggers the out-of-bounds read. User interaction is required.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim. The victim needs to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application."
