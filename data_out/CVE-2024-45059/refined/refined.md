Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the construction of a SQL query through string concatenation, using a user-controlled GET parameter (`cod_func`) without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct incorporation of user input into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full database access:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to gain complete and unrestricted access to the database.
*   **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information, such as user emails and password hashes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `cod_func` GET parameter.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.
*   **Basic web request knowledge:** The attacker must be able to manipulate GET parameters in HTTP requests.
*   **SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.
