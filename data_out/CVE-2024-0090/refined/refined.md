The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in NVIDIA GPU drivers and vGPU software, including CVE-2024-0090.

**CVE-2024-0090**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA GPU driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability where a user can cause an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access is required (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L), and low privileges (PR:L). No user interaction is required (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to execute code with low privileges.
