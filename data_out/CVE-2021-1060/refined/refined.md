Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software, specifically in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin.
- The root cause is the lack of validation of an input index.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Input Validation Failure:** The software fails to properly validate an input index, leading to a potential out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Tampering:** Exploitation of the vulnerability can allow an attacker to modify or corrupt data.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, potentially crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning an attacker would need to have access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker can be a local user with low privileges.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-1060 is present in the NVIDIA vGPU software and is caused by a missing input index validation in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin. This can lead to data tampering and denial of service. The attack is local and can be performed by a low privilege user.
