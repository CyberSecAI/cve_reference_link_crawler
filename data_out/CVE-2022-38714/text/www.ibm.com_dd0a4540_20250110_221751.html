# Security Bulletin: DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data Is Vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure Error (CVE-2022-38714)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data had the potential of exposing database connection details (database names, database user-id, database credential) to authorized users with Cluster Admin role had they performed remote access to running datastage containers that was processing such database connections. This vulnerability has been addressed.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2022-38714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-38714)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data | All |

## Remediation/Fixes

A project administrator must install this patch to fix issues with the datastage-ibm-datastage-runtime service in DataStage Version 4.5.2.
## Procedure

**Air Gapped Environment**

In an **air-gapped** environment, proceed with the following steps:

* Log in to the OpenShift console as the cluster admin.
* Prepare the authentication credentials to access the IBM production repository. Use the same auth.json file used for CASE download and image mirroring. For example:
* Install **skopeo** by running:
  ```
  yum install skopeo

  ```
* To confirm the path for the local private registry to copy the patch image, run the following command:

```
oc describe pod <datastage-ibm-datastage-runtime pod> -n <cpd_instance_namespace> | grep -i "image:"

```

For example:

```
  oc describe pod datastage-ibm-datastage-runtime-857bc54b4-qcdgx  -n <cpd_instance_namespace> | grep -i "image:"

  Image:         cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/ds-runtime@sha256:5fd1e1035790e7af16c7bcc423f862d5ad55e8ba1e4efaf933e6468a3d1c2ada

```

* To get the local private registry source details, run the following commands:

```
  oc get imageContentSourcePolicy
  oc describe imageContentSourcePolicy [cloud-pak-for-data-mirror]

```

The local private registry mirror repository and path details should be in the output of the describe command:

```
  - mirrors:
  - ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION}/cp/cpd
   source: cp.icr.io/cp/cpd

```

For more information about mirroring of images, see [Configuring your cluster to pull Cloud Pak for Data images](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/4.0?topic=tasks-configuring-your-cluster-pull-images&_ga=2.178716004.1196798321.1661978932-1130223110.1652891046).

* Use the **skopeo** command to copy the patch images from the IBM production registry ([cp.icr.io/cp/cpd](http://cp.icr.io/cp/cpd) registry) to the local private registry. Using the appropriate auth.json file, copy the patch images from the IBM production registry to the Openshift cluster registry:

```
  skopeo copy docker://cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/ds-runtime:452.0.11  docker://<private registry>/cp/cpd/ds-runtime:452.0.11 --authfile "<folder path>/auth.json"

```

* Run the following command to apply the patch to the DataStage custom resource (**datastage**):

```
  oc patch datastage datastage -n <cpd_instance_namespace> --type merge -p '{"spec":{"image_digests":{"canvas":"sha256:01dc73b23ad6eac8196ea1fc4d9ccd8d3e8b7c6d7b6b7144b605bc1dfb9983a1","caslite":"sha256:1adde097d2a2998d844b301b4165e2811bf61d2971d51b2b16b58a5ccef34849", "codegen":"sha256:1b717ef32d600d11cbc83c81e8fd6f65ef1be259e69ef05a52e2abcfaae12ff9", "flows": "sha256:d6bf09409324226aa7afa7ba47466c9ec3436b219b55fb74ad9ea80961774df8", "nginx": "sha256:38072713437b4d6f6551de66353b993deb70b75fc27f06c1c707a0aa36dbe4a7", "migration": "sha256:80e99fb87e90e2f3f8885f99beaffb87afc11d3624c8a4aa615c870e054aa49e", "assets": "sha256:ab108e5f2644ac091cfab9411dc12332cec9f229709e71b1e2de35b5a3a6a5d9", "ruleset": "sha256:ffd475cb341673fcd7a4d09bc2b764b050e1c9eea0977d002aff8a6b737a353e", "runtime": "sha256:5fd1e1035790e7af16c7bcc423f862d5ad55e8ba1e4efaf933e6468a3d1c2ada"}}}'

```

* Wait for the DataStage operator reconciliation to complete

```
  oc get datastage datastage -o yaml -n <cpd_instance_namespace>

```

It can take 15 - 20 minutes for the command to complete and the datastage-ibm-datastage-runtime pod to be up and running with the patched image.

**Non-Air Gapped Environment**

In an non-air-gapped environment, (i.e. using the online IBM entitled registry), proceed with the following steps:

* Run the following command to apply the patch to the DataStage custom resource (**datastage**):

```
  oc patch datastage datastage -n <cpd_instance_namespace> --type merge -p '{"spec":{"image_digests":{"canvas":"sha256:01dc73b23ad6eac8196ea1fc4d9ccd8d3e8b7c6d7b6b7144b605bc1dfb9983a1","caslite":"sha256:1adde097d2a2998d844b301b4165e2811bf61d2971d51b2b16b58a5ccef34849", "codegen":"sha256:1b717ef32d600d11cbc83c81e8fd6f65ef1be259e69ef05a52e2abcfaae12ff9", "flows": "sha256:d6bf09409324226aa7afa7ba47466c9ec3436b219b55fb74ad9ea80961774df8", "nginx": "sha256:38072713437b4d6f6551de66353b993deb70b75fc27f06c1c707a0aa36dbe4a7", "migration": "sha256:80e99fb87e90e2f3f8885f99beaffb87afc11d3624c8a4aa615c870e054aa49e", "assets": "sha256:ab108e5f2644ac091cfab9411dc12332cec9f229709e71b1e2de35b5a3a6a5d9", "ruleset": "sha256:ffd475cb341673fcd7a4d09bc2b764b050e1c9eea0977d002aff8a6b737a353e", "runtime": "sha256:5fd1e1035790e7af16c7bcc423f862d5ad55e8ba1e4efaf933e6468a3d1c2ada"}}}'

```

* Wait for the DataStage operator reconciliation to complete

```
  oc get datastage datastage -o yaml -n <cpd_instance_namespace>

```

It can take 15 - 20 minutes for the command to complete and the datastage-ibm-datastage-runtime pod to be up and running with the patched image.
