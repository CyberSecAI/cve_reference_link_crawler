- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data handles database connection details. Specifically, the system has the potential to expose sensitive information like database names, user IDs, and credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive database connection details. This is due to the way remote access to running DataStage containers is handled when those containers are processing database connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authorized user with a Cluster Admin role could potentially gain access to database connection details (database names, database user-id, database credential) by remotely accessing running datastage containers.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access to running datastage containers that are processing database connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authorized user with a Cluster Admin role.
