- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `wd210std.dll` dynamic library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the affected component.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system where the vulnerable `wd210std.dll` is present.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the target system and the ability to interact with the affected component. The CVSS score indicates the attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
