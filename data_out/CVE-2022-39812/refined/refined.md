    *   An authenticated attacker sends a POST request to the `/notification/createnotification` endpoint that contains an arbitrary URL.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires valid authentication.

**CVE-2022-45168 – Livebox Collaboration vDesk**

*  **Root Cause:** Improper Authentication
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application allows a user to generate backup codes before verifying the TOTP, which allows bypassing of 2FA.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user can bypass the two-factor authentication.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *  An authenticated user generates backup codes before checking TOTP.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires a valid session to exploit.

**CVE-2022-43675 – NOKIA NFM-T Network Element Manager**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Reflected Cross-site Scripting')
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The web application does not sanitize the input in multiple HTTP/GET parameters, allowing for Reflected XSS attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject Javascript code into various GET parameters, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in a user's browser.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An unauthenticated attacker crafts an HTTP GET request with malicious code in various parameters such as filename, id and others.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires network access; no authentication is required.

**CVE-2022-41763 – NOKIA AMS**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A remote user with proper authentication can inject code via debugger to the `ipAddress` variable in the `PING` function.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject code that will be executed by the server, leading to arbitrary command execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
     *   An authenticated attacker can inject code in the PING function by modifying the `ipAddress` variable through the debugger.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires valid authentication to the application.

**CVE-2022-41762 – NOKIA NFM-T Network Element Manager**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Reflected Cross-site Scripting')
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The application does not sanitize the parameters sent as
