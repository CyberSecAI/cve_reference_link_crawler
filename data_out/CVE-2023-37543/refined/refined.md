- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly validate user access privileges to specific resources, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions by manipulating object references.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The application does not validate if the user is authorized to access a specific resource.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access data related to other users by manipulating the `local_graph_id` parameter in requests, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By intercepting and modifying the `local_graph_id` parameter in the `graph_xport.php` request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user with the ability to fetch graphs for at least one user. By manipulating the `local_graph_id` the attacker can retrieve graphs from other users.
