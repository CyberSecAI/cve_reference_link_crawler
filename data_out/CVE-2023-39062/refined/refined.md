Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of request parameters passed to the `example9.php` and `forms.php` example files within the Spipu Html2Pdf library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to capture user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable example files, specifically `example9.php` and `forms.php`.
- **Parameter Injection:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected through URL parameters such as `test` in the example requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the Spipu Html2Pdf library.
- No specific authentication or user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability other than visiting a link with the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Spipu Html2Pdf versions prior to 5.2.8.
- The issue was fixed in version 5.2.8, which was released on 2023-07-18.
- The vulnerability was reported by Micha≈Ç Majchrowicz, Livio Victoriano and Zbigniew Piotrak from [AFINE Team](https://www.afine.pl/).
- The provided examples demonstrate how the malicious script is reflected in the server's response, confirming the lack of proper sanitization.
- The affected files are example files that should not be deployed in production, however, it is possible that they are exposed by mistake.
