Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21939:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The CISA advisory ([https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-040-03](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-040-03)) directly mentions CVE-2022-21939, confirming that the provided content is related to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of the `HttpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies in the Johnson Controls System Configuration Tool (SCT), versions 14 and 15.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag:** The application does not set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies, making them accessible to client-side scripts, which can be exploited by Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access session cookies.
*   An attacker could potentially take over the user's session, gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. An attacker would need to inject malicious scripts into the application.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely (over the network).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, typically through a user interaction (e.g., tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website).
*   The attack can be carried out remotely, without requiring local access to the affected system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to perform a cross-site scripting attack, which usually involves tricking a user into interacting with a malicious link or website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions **CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute** (CVE-2022-21940). This is a related vulnerability where cookies transmitted over HTTPS lack the "Secure" attribute, which could be exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack if the connection is downgraded from HTTPS to HTTP.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, categorized as high.
*   Affected products include System Configuration Tool (SCT) version 14 prior to 14.2.3 and version 15 prior to 15.0.3.
