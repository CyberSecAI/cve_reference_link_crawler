The provided content is related to CVE-2022-21939.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The System Configuration Tool (SCT) versions 14 and 15 are vulnerable because they do not set the 'HttpOnly' flag for sensitive cookies, making them accessible to JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-1004:** Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag. This vulnerability exists because the application doesn't set the `HttpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access cookies and take over the user's session, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker would need to inject malicious code into the application that can then access these cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to perform a cross-site scripting attack, which has a high attack complexity.
*   The attack is exploitable remotely (AV:N).
*   No privileges are required (PR:N).
*   User interaction (UI:R) is required (e.g., a user clicking a malicious link)

The document also mentions a related vulnerability CVE-2022-21940 (CWE-614) which is the lack of the `Secure` flag on sensitive cookies over HTTPS.
