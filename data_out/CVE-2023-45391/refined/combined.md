Hi All,

I was able to identify stored XSS in one online attendance system i.e. GRANDING UTime Master (v UTime Master\_9.0.7-Build:Apr 4,2023).

**CVE ID: CVE-2023-45391**

UTime Master is a powerful web-based time and attendance management
software that provides a stable connection to GRANDING’s standalone push
communication devices by Ethernet/Wi-Fi/GPRS/3G and working as a
private cloud to offer employee self-service by mobile application and
web browser.

1. Login to UTime Master using admin account
2. Click on Personnel > Employee Management >Employee
3. Select Any employee or create a new employee
4. In First name Section embed you payload. For test case I used "/><img src=a onerror=alert(22)>

I have also observed multiple other fields are also vulnerable to XSS e.g. Device Name, Department etc.*

Dear Reader, I was able to identify stored XSS in multiple web base modules of Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform  Below are its details: # Software description: Ericsson Billing is a convergent billing solution for telecoms that combines an unrivaled combination of out-of-the box features and high configurability. As an evolution of the widely-installed Ericsson BSCS iX, Ericsson Billing provides a low-risk but effective route to capture and secure revenue streams and take advantage of business opportunities from both traditional telecom services as well as digital services, 5G and IoT. # Technical Details & Impact: There are multiple web base modules in BSCS iX e.g. ADMX, MX (monitoring center), CX etc. It was observed that ADMX and MX are vulnerable to stored XSS, In most test cases session hijacking was also possible by utilizing the XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows for full account takeover, or exploiting admin's browsers using beef...
