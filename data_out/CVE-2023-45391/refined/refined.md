The provided content is related to CVE-2023-45391.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "First name" field when creating or editing an employee record, as well as other fields like "Device Name" and "Department". This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be logged into the UTime Master web application using an admin account.
- The attacker then navigates to the employee management section and inputs malicious javascript payload in the employee first name field.
- The XSS payload executes when an admin views the page containing the stored data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an administrative account on the UTime Master web application.
