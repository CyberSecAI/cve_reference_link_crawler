      "source": "www.foxit.com_e1af397d_20250111_014328.html",
      "vulnerability": {
        "rootCause": "The application fails to properly validate user-supplied data when handling certain XFA documents, specifically during image resource parsing, which may result in a read past the end of allocated buffer.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Untrusted URL Invocation",
          "Information Disclosure"
        ],
        "impact": "Attackers could access resources, execute malicious actions under users’ systems, or exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents.",
            "Handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function or certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function.",
           "Submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create and distribute a specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious payload.",
        "notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by the application loading images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers, fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users."

        "rootCause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Bookmark objects, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",

          "Out-Of-Bounds Read",

          "Visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file."
