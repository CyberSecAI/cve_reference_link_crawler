Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3055

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `id` parameter, combined with a lack of adequate preparation of the existing SQL query in the `Unlimited Elements For Elementor` plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries. This occurs due to inadequate sanitization of the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database by appending additional SQL queries.
- **Potential Full Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration, successful SQL injection could lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network (AV:N).
- **SQL Injection via `id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter is the primary attack vector, enabling the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site (PR:L).
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any specific user interaction (UI:N).

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the `Unlimited Elements For Elementor` plugin up to and including 1.5.102 are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 1.5.105.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8, categorized as "High" severity.
- **Specific Code Location:** The vulnerable code is located in the `db.class.php` file.
- **Wordfence reference:** Wordfence has identified the vulnerability as "Authenticated (Contributor+) SQL Injection".
- **Mitigation:** Update the plugin to version 1.5.105 or later.
