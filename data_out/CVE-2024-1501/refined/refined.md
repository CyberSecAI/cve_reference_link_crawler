The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `install_wpr()` function of the Database Reset plugin. This function is responsible for installing the WP Reset plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of proper nonce validation in the `install_wpr()` function allows an attacker to forge a request to install the WP Reset plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link, leading to the installation of the WP Reset plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious link or embed a form on a website that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, triggers the installation of the WP Reset plugin on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a link or submitting a form.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site.
