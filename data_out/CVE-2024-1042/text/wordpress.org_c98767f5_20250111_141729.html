I do not recommend it, a year ago I wrote about canceling the subscription, unfortunately they did not turn it off and continue to charge from my cards.

they have excellent products, in my case I use both the wp radio directory and the wp radio player, they are excellent because I work a lot in the creation of stations, but the support they have is very bad, they do not answer emails, do not respond chat for that reason I give them one star, because it is useless to offer a good product but a bad support.

comprei este plugim mais dois complementos dele todos apresentam algum tipo de bug ou não funciona, enviei um ticket de suporte a empresa desemvolvedora e estou há ver navios a pelo menos 30 dias, comprei licenças vitalicias, e o pior não achei nenhuma solução de reembolso junto a empresa fremiuns que intermediou os pagamentos. Mantenho minha opinião até hoje estou vendo navios sem suporte até hoje

I have a pro version of the plugin, I can’t import stations, writes “Something went wrong. Please try again.” Please fix this problem

A pity, it does not have improvements for PageSpeed ​​Insights, and repowers some ajax errors in the console. but it’s a good resource pack. very limited by not allowing insertion of third party scode in your pages
