### Description

The WP Radio – Worldwide Online Radio Stations Directory for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to import radio stations, remove countries, and modify the plugin's settings, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting, tracked separately in CVE-2024-1041.

I do not recommend it, a year ago I wrote about canceling the subscription, unfortunately they did not turn it off and continue to charge from my cards.

they have excellent products, in my case I use both the wp radio directory and the wp radio player, they are excellent because I work a lot in the creation of stations, but the support they have is very bad, they do not answer emails, do not respond chat for that reason I give them one star, because it is useless to offer a good product but a bad support.

comprei este plugim mais dois complementos dele todos apresentam algum tipo de bug ou não funciona, enviei um ticket de suporte a empresa desemvolvedora e estou há ver navios a pelo menos 30 dias, comprei licenças vitalicias, e o pior não achei nenhuma solução de reembolso junto a empresa fremiuns que intermediou os pagamentos. Mantenho minha opinião até hoje estou vendo navios sem suporte até hoje

A pity, it does not have improvements for PageSpeed ​​Insights, and repowers some ajax errors in the console. but it’s a good resource pack. very limited by not allowing insertion of third party scode in your pages
