Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization/validation within the "Default Keyword" field of the Site Settings in CSZ CMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This occurs when user-supplied input is included in the page without proper escaping, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code in the victim's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected pages. This can lead to:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
        *   Stealing user credentials or other sensitive information
        *   Other client-side attacks

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the "Default Keyword" field in the Site Settings.
    *   An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the settings page of the CMS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an account with administrative privileges or access to site settings to inject the malicious payload into the "Default Keyword" field.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to visit the affected page after injecting the malicious payload.

**Additional Details**
* The specific payload used in the proof of concept (PoC) is: `<div><p title="</div><svg/onload=alert(1)>">`.
* This payload leverages an `svg` tag with an `onload` event to execute JavaScript code when the SVG is rendered by the browser.
