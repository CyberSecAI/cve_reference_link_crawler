- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The initial seed for the CSPRNG used by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was baked into the WebAssembly module during compilation due to the use of Wizer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable random number generation. The sequence of numbers generated by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was predictable because the seed for the CSPRNG was fixed during compilation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the WebAssembly module could predict the random numbers generated by these functions. This could be used to bypass cryptographic security controls and potentially disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions using these generators.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to the specific WebAssembly module where the affected functions are called.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the WebAssembly module that utilizes the vulnerable random number generation methods.
