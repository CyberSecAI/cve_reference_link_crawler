- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape form submissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the donation form, which will be executed when an administrator views the donation list. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a form submission to `/wp-content/plugins/donations-block/public/ajax-submit.php` with a malicious payload in the `donner_name` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication. The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. They do not need to be logged in or have any special privileges to inject the payload. The XSS is triggered when a logged-in admin views the donations at `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pdb_list`.
