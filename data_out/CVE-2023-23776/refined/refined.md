- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The log-fetch client request password is included in clear text within the heartbeat response from FortiAnalyzer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). Specifically, the client machine password is sent in plain text, which can be intercepted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can read the client machine password in clear text. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the client machine.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker, who has already authenticated to FortiAnalyzer, makes a log-fetch request. The vulnerable password can be read from the response to this request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a remote user who has successfully authenticated to FortiAnalyzer. They need to initiate a log-fetch request to trigger the vulnerable response.
