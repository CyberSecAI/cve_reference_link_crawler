Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Bref, when used with Event-Driven Functions and `RequestHandlerInterface`, handles multipart file uploads. Specifically, temporary files created during the parsing of multipart requests are not deleted after the request is processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Temporary File Leak:** The `parseBodyAndUploadedFiles` function in `src/Event/Http/Psr7Bridge.php` saves uploaded files to `/tmp` with a `bref_upload_` prefix but fails to delete these files after the request is handled.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The accumulation of temporary files can lead to the Lambda instance's disk filling up.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack by repeatedly sending multipart requests with files, filling the Lambda's disk. This can lead to the Lambda function becoming unresponsive or failing to process further requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multipart POST Requests:** The attack vector is through sending crafted POST requests with a `multipart/form-data` content type containing file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Lambda function's endpoint.
- The targeted Lambda function should be using the Event-Driven Function runtime, implement the `RequestHandlerInterface`, and have at least one endpoint accepting POST requests.
- The attacker can send requests up to 6MB in length and will need to send multiple requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in `bref/src/Event/Http/Psr7Bridge.php` between lines 94-125, where temporary files are created but not deleted.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.1.13
- The default Lambda disk size is 512MB, therefore with less than 100 requests the disk could be filled.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by repeatedly sending multipart requests with file uploads to a vulnerable Lambda function.
