The provided content is a commit diff from the Oracle Linux UEK kernel repository. It describes a change that moves the `filp_close()` call outside the `__close_fd_get_file()` function. This change is made to facilitate asynchronous closing and removal of file descriptors. The commit message indicates this change is important for allowing async close/removal of the fd.

The changes are located in the `drivers/android/binder.c` and `fs/file.c` files. The `binder.c` file now calls `filp_close()` directly instead of relying on `__close_fd_get_file()`. The `file.c` file has been modified to remove the call to `filp_close()` from inside `__close_fd_get_file()`.

This commit itself doesn't describe a vulnerability. The change is a refactoring of code for asynchronous operation and improved resource handling. Therefore, it is UNRELATED to CVE.

Response: UNRELATED
