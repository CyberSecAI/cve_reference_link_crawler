- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The UPF crashes when processing PFCP messages with a secondary IE type greater than 0x7fff. This is due to a slice bounds out of range error during the parsing of these messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of PFCP messages with large IE types leads to a slice bounds error in the `go-pfcp` library when parsing the messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send specially crafted PFCP messages to a vulnerable UPF instance, causing it to crash. This leads to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the PFCP interface of the UPF, where specially crafted PFCP messages are sent via UDP to port 8805.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the UPF's PFCP interface.

The provided content provides more detail than a standard CVE description. It includes a proof-of-concept Python script, log files, and the exact location of the error within the `go-pfcp` library. It also details the fix: updating the `go-pfcp` library to the latest version, which addresses the parsing vulnerability.
