- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Simple Job Board plugin is susceptible to directory listing. This occurs because the plugin allows public access to the directory where uploaded resumes are stored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory listing vulnerability, sensitive data disclosure
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can access and download publicly uploaded resumes, leading to exposure of sensitive personal information contained in them.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the directory through a web browser or using tools like `curl`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires no authentication to access the directory containing the resumes and does not require any special privileges.
