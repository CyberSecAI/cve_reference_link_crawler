{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fromqossetting` function in Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633) firmware has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy` to copy the user-supplied `qos` parameter into a fixed-size buffer without checking the length of input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow. Improper input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially overwrite data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behaviors.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/fromqossetting` by providing a large value for the `qos` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is explicitly stated as being required, implying an unauthenticated attack vector."
