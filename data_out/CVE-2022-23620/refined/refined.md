Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that `AbstractSxExportURLFactoryActionHandler#processSx` does not sanitize or escape SSX document references when serializing them to the filesystem during HTML export. This allows for the injection of filesystem navigation characters like "../" in the reference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting a malicious SSX/JSX reference containing "../", an attacker can manipulate the file path during the HTML export process. This can allow the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize the input from the SSX document references, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By controlling the path, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations accessible by the XWiki application on the server's filesystem. This could be leveraged for various malicious purposes, including:
    - Overwriting existing files, potentially leading to denial of service or system compromise.
    - Writing malicious code (e.g., web shells) to the server, potentially gaining unauthorized remote code execution.
    - Creating symbolic links or other filesystem objects to potentially escalate the attack.
- **HTML/PDF Export process manipulation:** This can corrupt or cause conflict with serialized files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is conducted through the HTML export feature of XWiki.
- A malicious user would craft an SSX/JSX document with a reference containing path traversal characters, like "../".
- The user then exports a page which includes the malicious SSX/JSX document as HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and modify pages within XWiki.
- The attacker needs to have the privileges to trigger the HTML/PDF export process. The GitHub advisory specifies that High privileges are required, though the XWiki Jira issue does not specify which privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to embed malicious SSX/JSX references into content that will be exported.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 13.6-rc-1 of XWiki.
- The vulnerability was present in versions from 6.2-rc-1 up to but not including 13.6.
- The fix involves changing the way the temporary files are generated during the export. Instead of relying on space and name, it uses a unique ID.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal)
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.5 with metrics AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H.
