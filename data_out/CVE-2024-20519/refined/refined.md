- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the software processes HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G, RV320, and RV325 Routers. This allows for sending crafted HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.
