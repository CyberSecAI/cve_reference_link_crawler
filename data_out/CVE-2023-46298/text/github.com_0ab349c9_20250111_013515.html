### @remorses **[remorses](/remorses)** commented [Aug 29, 2023](#issue-1872182656) • edited Loading

Fix [#45301](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/45301)

If you deploy Next.js with in front Cloudflare, empty prefetch responses will be cached because there is no `cache-control` header and the extension is .json, Cloudflare considers these requests cacheable assets

If you want a test for this I would like to know if there is an existing one where I can add the header check

Sorry, something went wrong.
