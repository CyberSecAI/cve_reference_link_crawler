  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of a `cache-control` header in prefetch responses for server-side rendered (SSR) pages when using middleware. When a Next.js application uses middleware, it prefetches data for SSR pages, and the responses for these prefetches, which are typically empty JSON objects, were not including a `cache-control: no-cache` header. This allowed intermediary caching systems, such as CDNs like Cloudflare, to cache these empty responses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing `cache-control` header in prefetch responses.",
        "Caching of empty prefetch responses by intermediary systems."
       ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that when a user navigates to an SSR page, if an intermediary caching system has cached the empty response from the prefetch, the application will not fetch the server-side props from the actual API. Instead, it will receive the cached empty response, leading to incorrect rendering or missing data on the client side.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a combination of middleware usage in Next.js, prefetching of data, and intermediary caching systems. An attacker doesn't directly trigger the vulnerability. Instead, the vulnerability is exposed when a user loads a page that prefetches data through a system with an intermediary cache, like a CDN.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "No direct attacker capabilities are required to exploit this vulnerability. It arises from the default behavior of Next.js combined with the presence of a CDN or similar caching layer. The 'attacker' is the system itself when it incorrectly caches an empty response. The fix is to add the header to prevent this caching behavior."
