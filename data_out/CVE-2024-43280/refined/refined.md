- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate redirect URLs, leading to open redirection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one, potentially causing phishing incidents. Users may be tricked into visiting a seemingly legitimate site and then redirected to a malicious site without their knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious redirect URL, an attacker can trick users into visiting it via a link on the legitimate site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication, meaning the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
