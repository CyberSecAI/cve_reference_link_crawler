## D-Link DCS-8300LHV2 ONVIF SetHostName Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-048ZDI-CAN-21322

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-51628](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51628) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.0, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [DCS-8300LHV2](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dcs-8300lhv2-full-hd-wifi-camera) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DCS-8300LHV2 IP cameras. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the SetHostName ONVIF call. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | D-Link has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
