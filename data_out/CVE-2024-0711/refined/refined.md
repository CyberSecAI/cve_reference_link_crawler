Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The "Buttons Shortcode and Widget" plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them within a page or post. This allows the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses:**
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- Lack of output escaping when rendering shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website.
- This code can execute in the browsers of other users who view the page, potentially leading to:
    - Data theft (session cookies, user information).
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirects to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using a crafted shortcode.
- Specifically, the `css_class` attribute of the shortcode is vulnerable because it allows the injection of malicious Javascript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit content and insert the vulnerable shortcode.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `css_class` attribute of the shortcode. The malicious payload is `onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"` which triggers an alert box on mouseover event.
- The vulnerable shortcode: `[otw\_shortcode\_button href="http://9ml" size="medium" icon\_position="left" shape="square" icon\_url="http://9ml" color\_class="otw-pink" css\_class='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"' target="\_blank"]123[/otw\_shortcode\_button]`
