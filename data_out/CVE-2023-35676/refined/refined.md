  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-35676",
      "root_cause": "The quickshare intent was being extracted and re-wrapped as a new PendingIntent when a screenshot URI was obtained. This resulted in the original intent being executed with SysUI's permissions, which the originating app may not possess.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of PendingIntent",
        "Privilege escalation vulnerability due to incorrect permission handling"
      ],
      "impact": "An application could potentially execute actions with elevated permissions of SysUI, which could allow for unauthorized data access or modification, or other system level actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker-controlled app could craft a quickshare intent that would be re-wrapped by the vulnerable code. When the screenshot is taken, the attacker's intent would be executed with SysUI's privileges.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the system and be able to initiate quickshare via the vulnerable mechanism. User interaction is not explicitly required but may be needed to initiate the quickshare operation, which is usually a user driven action."
