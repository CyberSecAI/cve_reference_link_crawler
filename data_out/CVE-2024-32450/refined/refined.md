- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WpTravelly plugin for WordPress, versions 1.6.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests that can be executed by authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can force higher privileged users to perform unintended actions on the website. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, usually through social engineering (e.g., clicking a link, opening a malicious page).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to induce a logged-in user of the WordPress site to execute a crafted request. The attacker does not require prior authentication to the vulnerable site, but a target user must be logged in.
