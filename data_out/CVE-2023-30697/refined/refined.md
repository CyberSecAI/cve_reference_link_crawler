**CVE-2023-30697:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper input validation in the `IpcTxCfgSetSimlockPayload` function within the `libsec-ril` library.
*   **Weakness:** The improper validation of input data allows for an out-of-bounds write.
*  **Impact:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause an out-of-bounds write. While the specific impact isn't detailed (e.g., code execution, denial of service), out-of-bounds writes are often leveraged for arbitrary code execution or causing crashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device to trigger the vulnerable function in `libsec-ril`.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android 11, 12, and 13 are affected.
*   **Patch:** The patch implements proper boundary check logic to prevent buffer overflow.
