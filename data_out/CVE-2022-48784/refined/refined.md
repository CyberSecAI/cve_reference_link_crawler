{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() function, where it iterates through the list of wireless devices (wdev) twice. The first loop closes network devices and the second loop destroys the interfaces. If the nl80211_netlink_notify() function is still marking interfaces as nl_owner_dead while cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() is running, a race occurs. This can lead to trying to destroy a device that hasn't been closed yet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Incorrect locking in netlink owner interface destruction"
    ],
    "impact": "The race condition can lead to a deadlock, as the code tries to destroy an interface that has not been closed yet, potentially causing system instability or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the destruction of wireless network interfaces using the cfg80211 subsystem.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trigger the destruction of wireless interfaces, which may require elevated privileges, or the ability to trigger a scenario where the race condition is exposed."
