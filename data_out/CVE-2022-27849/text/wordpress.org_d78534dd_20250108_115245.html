## Description

> The simplest possible persistent chat solution!
>
> Fully self-hosted: No 3rd-party account required üôÇ

Simple Ajax Chat makes it easy for your visitors to chat with each other on your website. Simply add a shortcode to any post or page and done! Instant chat forum anywhere. The chat form is fully customizable with many options, so you can create the perfect chat box for your visitors.

> Check out a [Live Demo of Simple Ajax Chat at WP-Mix ¬ª](https://wp-mix.com/chat/)

> **New** [Pro version](https://plugin-planet.com/simple-ajax-chat-pro/) supports unlimited chats!

Simple Ajax Chat is fully self-hosted with NO 3rd-party service required. Many (if not all) of the other free chat plugins require registration and monthly service from a 3rd-party provider. With Simple Ajax Chat, there is no 3rd-party: WordPress is all that‚Äôs required. Own your chats!

**Difference between SAC free and SAC Pro**

The **main** difference between SAC free and SAC Pro? Easy:

**Privacy**

This plugin collects voluntary user chat data (i.e., Name, Chat Message, and optional URL field). It also gives the administrator the option to collect or not collect user IP information. Aside from those two things, this plugin does not collect or store any user data. This plugin uses a few cookies for the chat functionality. It does not connect to any third-party locations. Minimal impact on privacy.

**Translations**

This plugin supports [translation into any language ¬ª](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/simple-ajax-chat)

**Developer**

Simple Ajax Chat is developed and maintained by [Jeff Starr](https://twitter.com/perishable), 15-year [WordPress developer](https://plugin-planet.com/) and [book author](https://books.perishablepress.com/).

  Simple Ajax Chat: Plugin Settings (panels toggle open/closed)

## Installation

**Installation**

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Visit the settings to configure your options

[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)

**Usage**

Once the settings are configured, you can display the form anywhere using the shortcode or template tag.

**Shortcode**

Use this shortcode to display the chat box on a post or page:

```
[sac_happens]

```

**Template Tag**

Use this template tag to display the chat box anywhere in your theme template:

```
<?php if (function_exists('simple_ajax_chat')) simple_ajax_chat(); ?>

```

**More chat forms and features**

The free version of SAC supports one chat form that can be displayed anywhere. The Pro version supports unlimited chat forms and great features like Google reCaptcha, private chats, mute/ban users, and much more. [Get SAC Pro ¬ª](https://plugin-planet.com/simple-ajax-chat-pro/)

**Upgrades**

To upgrade Simple Ajax Chat, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

**Note:** uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the *removal of all settings and chat messages* from the WP database.

**Restore Default Options**

To restore default plugin options, either uninstall/reinstall the plugin, or visit the plugin settings > Restore Default Options.

**Uninstalling**

Simple Ajax Chat cleans up after itself. All plugin settings and chat messages will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen.

**Stopping spam**

This plugin works in two modes:

* ‚ÄúOpen Air‚Äù mode ‚Äì anyone can chat
* ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù mode ‚Äì only logged-in users can chat

‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù mode stops all automated spam, but registered users may still send ‚Äúspammy‚Äù chat messages. Likewise, the ‚ÄúOpen Air‚Äù mode is super effective at blocking automated spam, but some manual spam may get through. As a general rule, the longer your chat forum is online, the more of a target it will be for spam.

Alternately/additionally you can [use .htaccess to block spammers](https://wp-mix.com/htaccess-block-spammer/). It‚Äôs an easy, super-effective method for controlling access to your site.

**Browser Notifications**

SAC provides optional browser notifications. When enabled in the plugin settings, all of the notification stuff happens automatically, depending on your browser settings. For example, if your browser is set to deny all site notifications, then you won‚Äôt see any SAC notifications. Likewise, if your browser is configured to allow notifications (and they are enabled in the settings), then you will see the notifications display whenever you are visiting the chat box and someone leaves a message. For more infos, check out the documentation for your specific browser.

**Other Notes**

Some additional notes just FYI:

* The chat markup includes `sac-online` class for online users
* Includes template of all CSS hooks (located @ `/resources/sac.css`)
* Timestamp for each chat message included in chat markup

## FAQ

### How do I change the alert sound?

Open the directory `/resources/audio/` and replace the files `msg.mp3` and `msg.ogg` with your desired audio files. You will notice lots of alternate sound files included in that same directory. Simply rename any pair of files to replace the defaults.

### Where can I find a complete list of CSS selectors?

Check out `sac.css` located in the `resources` directory.

### Can we auto-delete chat messages on a set time interval?

Yes, please see this post at WP-Mix.com: [Auto-Clear Chats](https://wp-mix.com/simple-ajax-chat-auto-clear-chats/).

### Does it work with mobile devices?

Yep, the chat plugin works great on iPhones, Android devices, and just about anything that supports JavaScript.. the functionality is achieved using Ajax.

### Is it possible to whitelist SAC plugin files?

Yes, check out [Simple Ajax Chat .htaccess whitelist](https://wp-mix.com/simple-ajax-chat-htaccess-whitelist/) and/or [Whitelist POST access with .htaccess](https://wp-mix.com/whitelist-post-access-htaccess/)

### How do I hide ‚ÄúLatest Message: X minutes ago‚Äù?

Add this CSS:

```
#sac-latest-message { display: none; }

```

You can add that to the plugin setting, ‚ÄúCustom CSS styles‚Äù or your theme styles, wherever. If adding via the plugin setting, make sure that the associated setting, ‚ÄúEnable custom styles‚Äù also is enabled.

### How do I hide the Name, URL, etc. labels on the form?

Add this CSS:

```
#sac-form label { display: none; }

```

You can add that to the plugin setting, ‚ÄúCustom CSS styles‚Äù or your theme styles, wherever. If adding via the plugin setting, make sure that the associated setting, ‚ÄúEnable custom styles‚Äù also is enabled.

### How to remove the ‚Äúsay it‚Äù button?

You can hide the ‚Äúsay it‚Äù submit button, so the user must press enter to submit chats. Add this CSS:

```
#sac-user-submit { display: none; }

```

You can add that to the plugin setting, ‚ÄúCustom CSS styles‚Äù or your theme styles, wherever. If adding via the plugin setting, make sure that the associated setting, ‚ÄúEnable custom styles‚Äù also is enabled.

### The form is not displaying correctly, looks all messed up?

Simple Ajax Chat is designed to look great on any of the default WP themes and most other themes as well. Even so, every theme is different, and it‚Äôs impossible to test on the hundreds of thousands of themes that are available. So if the chat form is not looking awesome on your theme, it‚Äôs because your theme for whatever reason is applying its own particular styles. If this is the case, you can try disabling the plugin setting to ‚ÄúEnable custom styles‚Äù. If that doesn‚Äôt help, you can include your own custom CSS, or customize the plugin‚Äôs default styles. Alternately, you may include custom CSS via your theme‚Äôs stylesheet, and/or modify your theme‚Äôs CSS as needed to make things display as desired. Tip: to see how the chat form *should* look, check it out using any of the default WP themes.

### The chat form is visible but new chats are not displayed?

If this is happening, and/or if you are receiving a ‚ÄúFailed opening required‚Äù error message, most likely your site‚Äôs `wp-load.php` file is not located in the usual default location (i.e., it has been moved to a custom location). If this is the case, you will need to edit the paths in `/simple-ajax-chat-core.php` (line 4) and `/resources/sac.php` (line 10). At some point I will be revamping the plugin so that this modification won‚Äôt be necessary.

### How do I fix weird characters displayed in the chat box?

If you are seeing question marks or other weird characters or symbols in chat messages, you can try one of the following solutions:

* Uninstall (delete) the plugin, and then re-install. Note that this technique resets all settings and deletes all chat messages.
* Or, if you don‚Äôt want to lose any settings or chat messages, you can run the following SQL command: `ALTER TABLE wp_ajax_chat CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;`

Either of these techniques should resolve any weird character issues. Note that the SQL command assumes you are using the default database prefix, `wp_`. So make sure to edit that part of the command if you are using a custom database prefix.

### How do I customize the login-required message?

By default, the login-required message is ‚ÄúYou must be a registered user to participate in this chat.‚Äù To customize this message, check out [this forum post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/better-integration-with-buddypress/#post-9368504).

### Chat Box not working in certain browsers (e.g., Chrome)?

Certain plugins (e.g., Shield Security) may implement security headers that prevent SAC from working properly. To resolve this issue, visit the ‚ÄúHTTP Headers‚Äù tab and go to ‚ÄúSecurity Headers tab‚Äù (or similar depending on which plugin you are using). There you can set the ‚ÄúReferrer Policy‚Äù to ‚ÄúSame Origin‚Äù and then save changes. SAC immediately should start working properly, but you also may need to clear the browser cache and hard reload the page.

### How to translate form inputs?

If the form inputs like ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button are not showing translation. You can work around by adding the following jQuery snippet:

```
<script>jQuery(function() { jQuery('#submitchat').val('Whatever'); });</script>

```

That needs to be included in your theme **after** jQuery is loaded. Then change `#submitchat` to the ID of the form input. Change `Whatever` to whatever you want to display for the text.

### How to show the date/time of each chat?

Add the following CSS to the plugin setting, ‚ÄúCustom CSS styles‚Äù:

```
ul#sac-messages li.sac-chat-message::before { content: "[ 'attr(data-time)' ]"; color: #777; }

```

After saving changes, that CSS will display the chat date/time next to each message, for example:

[ 2021-08-30,08:35:57 ] Chat User: Hello this is a chat message left in August of 2021.

### How to display chat box and form in vertical fashion?

By default, the chat box and form are displayed side by side. Here is a quick [tutorial](https://wp-mix.com/responsive-css-for-simple-ajax-chat/) to display them vertically, so the chat form is below the chat box. This is useful for optimizing SAC for limited space on the page.

Super easy to install via shortcode. Tweak a few settings and you‚Äôre off to the races. Copy and paste shortcode anywhere you want it to show, easy to make it into a pattern reusable block.

The plugin is simple to install and works exactly the way I would expect a group chat to work. It doesn‚Äôt get in your way.Note: When I installed the SAC, I was getting an Access Denied error whenever I tried to send a chat. My security plugin had locked the plugin directory. I disabled that feature in my security plugin and all worked perfectly

I‚Äôm leaving my first review to shame myself. Once I wrote the review, I got feed back for the developer who, I can understand wasn‚Äôt none to sure to why I wrote the review without asking for help first.
After great support from the developer, and a lot ‚Äúand I mean a lot‚Äù of patience on his behalf, he solved the problem. I‚Äôve given five stars as it is more than well deserved. I think going pro will be worth it later, but maybe a small donation is more than well merited in the meantime.
Everything is working fine after one simple solution was found. So simple infact I felt like a complete‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Well, lets be polite about it.. Idiot.
Seriously, if it dosen‚Äôt work properly at first, be paitent, contact the developer and see what soultions can be found. I‚Äôm sure you will not regret it.
I send my sincere apologies for being so negative.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt star rate as I couldn‚Äôt get it to work. It blocked my login and register form. Kept saying that users had to be logged in to post messages, which is what I set it too. But it wouldn‚Äôt let users login and those who were logged in got logout automaticlly, except for the admin. Shame really, it was exactly what I was looking for.‚Äù
