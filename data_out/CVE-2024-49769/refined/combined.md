### @digitalresistor **[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)** commented [Mar 3, 2024](#issue-2165622090)

When we `accept()` a connection we get the remote address and we pass it to `HTTPChannel`, then in `wasyncore.dispatcher` we were calling `getpeername()` again to get the same remote address that we already had.

This would cause an issue if the remote client had sent data, but closed the connection before `getpeername()` because the `wasyncore.dispatcher` would set the channel to no longer being connected.

Further down the line this would cause issues whereby `handle_write` would loop over and over because it would mark itself as selectable but the socket would never actually get torn down.

Closes [#418](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418)

Supersedes [#419](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/419)

| great, find and thanks for fixing this. We have been running a server at <https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests> that almost reads like the description of the testcase in [#418 (comment)](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418#issuecomment-1716970514) and have seen this happen multiple times in the past, if the load on the server was high (with dropped connections by nginx / nginx reboots), almost on a daily basis (most recently discussed as [official-stockfish/fishtest#2094](https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/issues/2094) ... but we had no real clue).  We'd be happy to upgrade waitress to an eventual 3.0.1 as mentioned in [3495674](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/34956747f6d34755471b29157c3e99f707829371) . Is there a timeline for that (also in light of the green CI)? |

# DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion

High

[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)
published
GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6
Oct 29, 2024

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function.

A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.

### Patches

Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.

### Workarounds

No work-around.

### References

* [#418](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Following on from debugging in this issue - [collective/haufe.requestmonitoring#15](https://github.com/collective/haufe.requestmonitoring/issues/15)  What we see is waitress switching into 100% CPU and staying there. It is happening in production randomly (within a week) and we haven't traced it back to a certain request).  Using a sampling profiler on waitress with 2 threads (in prod) we identified the thread using the CPU as the mainthread (top -H) and this is the profile. Note that since this is prod there are other requests so not all activity is related to the looping causing this bug.  ```  Austin  TUI   Wall Time Profile

So then it goes into a loop without writing or closing since it never actually does anything to the socket. <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/main/src/waitress/channel.py#L98>  EDIT: My suspicion would be that what started this was a client that shutdown (half) very quickly after a connect and this happened before the dispatcher finished being setup. This causes getpeername to fail with EINVAL and connected = False.     [waitress/src/waitress/wasyncore.py](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/4f6789b035610e0552738cdc4b35ca809a592d48/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L310)  Line 310 in [4f6789b](/Pylons/waitress/commit/4f6789b035610e0552738cdc4b35ca809a592d48)   |  | self.connected = False | | --- | --- |      ```             try:                 self.addr = sock.getpeername()             except OSError as err:                 if err.args[0] in (ENOTCONN, EINVAL):                     # To handle the case where we got an unconnected                     # socket.                     self.connected = False                 else:                     # The socket is broken in some unknown way, alert                     # the user and remove it from the map (to prevent                     # polling of broken sockets).                     self.del_channel(map)                     raise ```  Could be same issue as [#411](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/411) but hard to tell.  One fix in [#419](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/419) but could be better ways? |

| [@d-maurer](https://github.com/d-maurer)  The error is where `self.connected` was set tu `False`. There, it should have been ensured that the corresponding "fileno" is removed von `socket_map` and that it will not be put there again (as long as `self.connected` remains `False`).  Something exceptional must have brought `waitress` into this state (otherwise, we would have lots of 100 % CPU usage reports). I assume that some bad client has used the system call `shutdown` to close only part of the socket connection and that `waitress`does not anticipate something like that.  Waitress does seem to properly close if shutdown is received (empty data). see <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/main/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L449>  So have to keep looking for a way connected can be false but it can still be trying to write. Yes it is most likely bad actors. We get hit by this a lot in our line of business. |

However, the client might shut down the receiving part; for me, this does not suggest an empty data read. |

Waitress does seem to properly close if shutdown is received (empty data). see <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/main/src/waitress/wasyncore.py#L449>  I have an idea how to fix the inconsistency without understanding how it came into being: The `handle\_write\_event` is (likely) only called by the loop. Thus, if it is called and the connection is closed, it can detect an inconsistency (a closed connection should not get events). It can resolve the inconsistency by deregistration with the loop. |

[#419](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/419)  Some test should not be that difficult: you register a `write` handler for a connection and then set `connected` to `False`. In the next loop run, there will be a write event and you can check that it does not end in an infinite loop. Of course, the test only verifies that a `not connected` does not lead to an infinite loop. It does not try to set up a realistic case for setting `connected` to `False`. |

| Looks like it is possible a connection thats been broken before getpeername to then no have any error in select. in the case where there is nothing to read since that will result in a close. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13257047/python-select-does-not-catch-broken-socket>. not sure how it has something write in that case. maybe shutdown for readonly very quickly?  EDIT: <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getpeername.3p.html>  "EINVAL The socket has been shut down." <- so looks like shutdown for read very quickly seems possible to create this tight loop. |

It, too, uses `del\_channel` suggesting "delete channel". While "delete channel" likely removes the channel from the socket map, it likely does more than that -- and maybe things not best placed into `poll`. Another point: the `map` may contain objects without `del\_channel` (e.g. non channels) and `check\_client\_disconnected`. In those cases, the code above would raise an exception and bring your service down. Currently, I favor the following reasoning: You have detected that a write event for a "non connected" connection leads to a busy loop. We must do something about it (either prevent the case from happening or clean up locally). For the local cleanup, I proposed to unregister the "write event handler". You have translated this into a call to `del\_channel`, likely because the loop does not support "write event handler"s. The loop API only supports the registration of objects (with `fileno`, `readable` and `writable`, ... methods); those objects' `writable` method indicates whether the object is interested in write event notifications. I propose to implement "unregister the write event handler" not by a `del\_channel` call but by a modification of `writable`: ensure it returns false for a non connected connection. In the long run `waitress` should likely change its "connected" concept. HTTP is based on TCP which implements bidirectional communication channels. The `shutdown` system call allows applications to shut down individual directions. This is not compatible with a boolean "connected", instead we have 4 connection states: (fully) disconnected, read connected, write connected and (fully) connected. I do not know whether important HTTP clients exist which use `shutdown`. Some might want to signal "no more input" by shutting down the outgoing communication channel, e.g. for a long download. perhaps you have a better idea on how it could have got into this knot My primary thought: It must be something exceptional which caused the situation. Otherwise, lots of 100 % CPU usage reports should have been seen. Initially, I thought of a use of `shutdown` to (only) partially shut down the socket. Likely, such a use is unanticipated and may reveal bugs. Meanwhile, I can think of other causes: Maybe, when the connection is closed while the response is beeing streamed back, an inconsistency can creep in. The "async" world should be quite robust against such types of problems (because all IO logic is serialized) but the system is connected to a network and important network events (e.g. the closing of a communication channel) can happen at any time and cause unanticipated exceptions changing the normal control flow. and the best way to test? We have here the case that we cannot reproduce the real situation (because we do not know how the inconsistency was introduced). We therefore only implement a workaround. My favorite workaround (ensure "writable" returns "False" when "not connected") is so simple that no test is necessary to convince us that the busy loop is avoided. The workaround may not solve all problems. For example, it may keep a socket in use which should in principle have been closed. |

I do not think that this goes into the right direction: `waitress` is an HTTP server and (unlike e.g. a `telnet` server) it produces output only after it has received input. Thus, I expect that the problematic connection has once been in a `connected` state (to read something and then to produce output). |

| [@d-maurer](https://github.com/d-maurer) I'm fairly sure I have one solid explanation how this could occur.  Outlined in this test - <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/419/files#diff-5938662f28fcbb376792258701d0b6c21ec8a1232dada6ad2ca0ea97d4043d96R775>  NOTE: I haven't worked out a way to detect the looping in a test yet. So the assert at the end is not correct.  It is as you say. There is a shutdown of the read only but this is a race condition. it has to happen before the dispatcher is created so right after the connect. I've confirmed this results in an getpeername returning OSError EINVAL and thus connected = False and the select still thinks it can write so the loop will be inifinite. or maybe until the bad actor properly closes the connection. not sure on that one.  In the long run `waitress` should likely change its "connected" concept. HTTP is based on TCP which implements bidirectional communication channels. The `shutdown` system call allows applications to shut down individual directions. This is not compatible with a boolean "connected", instead we have 4 connection states: (fully) disconnected, read connected, write connected and (fully) connected.  true. but if I'm right on the cause of this this, the socket would never have connected=False with most shutdowns. Only when it happens too quickly. That flag is mostly used to indicate not yet connected or in the process of closing.  My favorite workaround (ensure "writable" returns "False" when "not connected") is so simple that no test is necessary to convince us that the busy loop is avoided.  yes that will also work. I'll switch it to that. There is a system to remove inactive sockets so I guess that would get them closed eventually. I'm not really sure the pros and cons of having sockets left open vs the consequences of just closing them for this case (I tried this. it also worked in terms of the tests). |

The connection's `writeable` must also return `True` (otherwise, the corresponding fd will not be included in `writefs`). Usually, this would happen if it is known that there is data to be output. |

[@digitalresistor](https://github.com/digitalresistor) [@kgaughan](https://github.com/kgaughan) ? I had a closer look at the code and I think I found a realistic scenario to enter the busy loop state: If `HTTPChannel.read` reads empty data, it sets `connected` to `False`; if there is pending output at that time we are in the busy loop state. We can force `HTTPChannel.read` to read empty data by letting the HTTP client shutdown its sending direction. Once all data has been read by the receiving site, its next `recv` will return empty data. A normal `close` (rather than `shutdown`) might have a similar effect. The hypothesis can be checked in the following way: Design an HTTP service to produce sufficient output to saturate the output channel. Design an HTTP client: it sends a request to the service (but does not read the response), waits sufficiently long such that the service has produced its output, then shuts down the writing direction of its HTTP connection (maybe just closes its HTTP connection). Check whether this has brings `waitress` into the busy loop state. |

| Dylan Jay wrote at 2023-9-13 00:07 -0700: [@d-maurer](https://github.com/d-maurer) that was my initial thought but as I pointed out in [#418 (comment)](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418#issuecomment-1714057512) recv in wasynccore will do ```handle\_close``` on getting empty data and take it out of the map as I couldn't see any way for no bytes being sent to cause this loop. I have meanwhile read the Python socket HOWTO (--> "<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html#socket-howto>"). It recommends (in the "Disconnecting" section) to operate in an HTTP-like exchange: send the request and then use `shutdown(1)` to indicate "I (the client) will produce no more output but am still ready for input". The behavior of `waitress` you point out above (close as soon as there is no more input) will not play well with this recommendation. |

Open a connection to the server and immediately close it again. The `sleep` should ensure that at the time of the `getpeername` call, the remote socket end is already closed (maybe, `getpeername` then fails with an exception and `connected` is set to `False`). Wait sufficiently long (somewhat longer than `cleanup\_interval`) to let `maintenance` set `will\_close`. If you are right, this will result in a busy loop. |

Verified via the following interactive code: server code: ```python from socket import socket, AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM ss = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM) ss.bind(("localhost", 10000)) ss.listen() cs, addr = ss.accept() # run the client code in a second interactive session cs.getpeername() ``` client code: ```python from socket import socket, AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM cs = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM) cs.connect(("localhost", 10000)) cs.close() ``` |

| "EINVAL The socket has been shut down." <- so looks like shutdown for read very quickly seems possible to create this tight loop.  Note that a socket has 2 ends. "The socket has been shut down" might refer to the local (not the remote) end. |

| No, `channel_request_lookahead` is used to allow waitress to try and read more than the first request (normally it would read a request, wait for a response to be created/processed, only then read the next request, so that it wouldn't read a bunch of data/HTTP pipelining requests from the wire without being able to respond for example if the connection was goin to be closed early)... this however meant there was no good way to let the app know that the client disconnected for long running requests that wanted to check before they committed data to the database for example.  That is why waitress has a `waitress.client_disconnected` callable in the environment that allows the app to check if the remote client has disconnected, but that only works if we continue to read() from the socket and thus get notified when the remote hangs up. |

It likely addresses the following scenario: the previous `handle\_read` has detected a remote closure and closed the channel; the following `handle\_write` may try to close the channel again which should be prevented. My proposal: do not abuse `connected` for this logic. Instead introduce an additional attribute `closed`, initially `False` and set to `True` in `\_dispatcher.close`. This way, `closed` is `True` if and only if `close` has already been called. The code above could become `if self.closed: return`. |

Thats also how it works in the test. I'll try it in production. That's where my speed argument may come in: when the state change from `channel.service()` (which likely requires a thread switch) happens after the next poll, `channel.readable()` still returns `True` in the `poll` and the channel has the chance to learn that the remote end was closed (closing the channel);; only when it happens before the next poll, it prevents `readable` from returning `True` and the remote end closing remains unnoticed. |

| [@djay](https://github.com/djay) I have not been using the test code you created. I wanted to reproduce it without trying to set up the conditions to match exactly, or forcing a socket into a particular state. I have been testing with waitress running on a RHEL 8.9 system, I have been unable to get `getpeername()` to fail in those conditions even while trying to do the half-shutdown and stress testing waitress at the same time. I have not manually manipulated SO\_LINGER to setup the conditions as specified, just using the defaults from the OS.  I also would expect to see far more instances of this error happening out in the wild, waitress is used extensively, and I have yet to see it happen on any of my applications that are running in production.  I don't disagree that there is an issue and we can solve it, but I find it interesting that it is not easily reproducible on test systems I have.  The current PR does the closing much later, I'd much rather see it get handled when `getpeername()` fails before we even attempt to do anything else with the socket, or start setting up a channel, if we can avoid doing extra work, let's avoid doing extra work.  Then we can rework the logic for writeable as well to make sure that we can't busy loop there. |

| [@digitalresistor](https://github.com/digitalresistor) The circumstances are very particular. It was something we were getting from pentests only I believe. An invalid request is sent and immediately closed by the client before the channel could be created. it would not be easy to reproduce as you would need the invalid request, and a loaded enough server that it not be so fast to create the channel.  The current PR does the closing much later, I'd much rather see it get handled when getpeername() fails before we even attempt to do anything else with the socket, or start setting up a channel, if we can avoid doing extra work, let's avoid doing extra work.

self.connected to False because the remote has already shut down part of
the socket.

This issue was uncovered in [#418](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418), where the server would go into a hard
loop because self.connected was used in various parts of the code base.

| I've created a new PR that removes `getpeername()` entirely. It is not useful in the context of waitress, and cleaned up some code related to `self.connected`, since calling `self.handle_close()` multiple times is not an issue.  Could you drop this into your system instead and take a look if you still see the same issue: [#435](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435) |

| [@digitalresistor](https://github.com/digitalresistor) I can. But are you sure that there is no other scenario where self.connected is False so it goes into a loop and it can't ever get closed down? ie this line is still problematic I think. <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/419/files#diff-5cb215c6142fa7daad673c77fcb7f3bc0a0630e18e3487a5ac0894e90f1b2071L95> |

| Could this be backported to the 2.x line? Updating to v3 causes infinite redirect loop on heroku which I can’t debug. |

| The only bw-incompat change in waitress was changing `clear_untrusted_proxy_headers=true` as the default. If you haven't setup trusted proxy configs you might want to just set this back to false and I suspect that's a thing that would fix your heroku issue. |
