# DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion

High

published
GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6
Oct 29, 2024

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function.

A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.

### Patches

Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.

### Workarounds

No work-around.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
