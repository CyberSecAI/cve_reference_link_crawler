- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Any user can add arbitrary custom fields to a topic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the ability of any user to create a topic and add arbitrary custom fields. This can be exploited by malicious users who can insert malicious data in the topic's custom fields if not properly sanitized.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact depends on what plugins are installed and how the plugins use topic custom fields. For a default Discourse installation, it has no impact. However, if plugins use custom fields in security-sensitive code paths, the consequences could be more severe and could lead to integrity or confidentiality issues by injecting malicious custom field data.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
