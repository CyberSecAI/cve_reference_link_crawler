Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-23814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the failure to validate addresses provided by software to BIOS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of addresses passed from software to BIOS commands. This allows the use of potentially invalid addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential loss of integrity of guest memory in a confidential compute environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted addresses to BIOS commands via software interfaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the software interface that issues BIOS commands. This could be achieved through a compromised hypervisor or a malicious application running at a high privilege level.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects systems using AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) technology, which is designed to protect guest virtual machines.
- The issue is mitigated in AGESA MilanPI-SP3_1.0.0.9 and later.
- This vulnerability was discovered in collaboration with Oracle.
