- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated settings update, lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can modify the plugin's OAuth endpoints, potentially gaining administrative access by controlling the authentication process. This can lead to full site compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `/` endpoint with the `action=oauthconfig` parameter, an attacker can update the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site. No prior authentication is required. The attacker needs to control the malicious OAuth endpoints.
