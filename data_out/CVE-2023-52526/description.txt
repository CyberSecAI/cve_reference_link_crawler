In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix memory leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication

When stressing microLZMA EROFS images with the new global compressed
deduplication feature enabled (`-Ededupe`), I found some short-lived
temporary pages weren't properly released, which could slowly cause
unexpected OOMs hours later.

Let's fix it now (LZ4 and DEFLATE don't have this issue.)
