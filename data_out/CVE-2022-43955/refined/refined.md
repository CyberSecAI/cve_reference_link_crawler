- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the FortiWeb web interface fails to sanitize log entries, which are used to build attack reports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79].
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code or commands in the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker injects a malicious payload into log entries. This payload is then executed when a user views an attack report.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious payload into log entries of FortiWeb.
