# Improper Input Validation and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption and Deserialization of Untrusted Data in GeoServer

High

[jodygarnett](/jodygarnett)
published
GHSA-4pm3-f52j-8ggh
Apr 13, 2022

## Package

maven

GeoServer
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 2.20.4, <2.19.6

## Patched versions

2.21.0, 2.20.4, 2.19.6

## Description

### Impact

The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism.

In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API.

### Patches

The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 2.19.6.

### Workarounds

Protection can be achieved by making the GUI (`geoserver/web`), the REST configuration (`geoserver/rest`) and the embedded GeoWebCache configuration (`geoserver/gwc/rest`) unreachable from remote hosts, in addition to protecting access to the file system where the GeoServer configuration is stored.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
