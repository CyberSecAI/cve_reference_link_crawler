Based on the provided information, both git commits address the same vulnerability. The vulnerability is an array index out-of-bounds error in the AMD display driver, specifically within the DCN32 Display Mode Logic (DML).

**Root Cause:**
The `LinkCapacitySupport` array in the `vba_vars_st` structure was incorrectly sized, being indexed by `DC__NUM_DPP__MAX` (maximum number of Display Pipe Processors), rather than `DC__VOLTAGE_STATES` (number of voltage states). This discrepancy led to an out-of-bounds access when the number of voltage states exceeded the maximum number of DPPs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Array index out-of-bounds: The code attempts to access an array element beyond its allocated memory, leading to a potential crash or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The out-of-bounds access could lead to memory corruption, system instability, or a crash. The severity of the impact might depend on the specific hardware and how the out-of-bounds access is handled by the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- This is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability. The vulnerability is within the kernel display driver, so it would most likely be triggered by manipulating display configurations or conditions that would cause the voltage state to be different than the number of DPPs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have local access to the machine and be able to influence the display settings or system's power/performance behavior to trigger the vulnerability.
