Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `firmwaredownload` command in Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0, when used in non-interactive mode, logs the FTP/SFTP/SCP server password in clear text within the SupportSave file. This occurs during a downgrade from Fabric OS v9.2.0 to an earlier version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of server passwords in clear text in the SupportSave file, which is a diagnostic file.
- The issue occurs specifically when downgrading from version 9.2.0 using the `firmwaredownload` command in non-interactive mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the SupportSave file can obtain the clear text passwords of FTP/SFTP/SCP servers, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need access to the `SupportSave` file which contains the logged cleartext password. 
- This typically means they would need access to the system on which the `firmwaredownload` command was executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a `SupportSave` file generated after a downgrade from Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0, where the `firmwaredownload` command was used in non-interactive mode.
- Access can be obtained either through direct access to the device, compromised system or potentially via other means if the `SupportSave` file was improperly transferred or stored.
- This vulnerability can be triggered through the CLI, REST API, or the web interface when the `firmwaredownload` command is executed non-interactively.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0.
- It affects downgrades to older versions when using the `firmwaredownload` command in non-interactive mode.
- The issue is resolved in Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0a and later versions.
- Workarounds include using the web interface or REST API, or running the `firmwaredownload` command in interactive mode.
- NetApp has also published an advisory regarding this vulnerability.
