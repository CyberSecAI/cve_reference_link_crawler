CVE-2023-3489

| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | BSA-2023-2335 |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | firmwaredownload command |
|  |  |

**Summary**

The firmwaredownload command on Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0 could log the FTP/SFTP/SCP server password in clear text in the SupportSave file when performing a downgrade from Fabric OS v9.2.0 to any earlier version of Fabric OS.

**CVE Details**
The firmwaredownload command downloads the Brocade Fabric OS firmware to the Brocade Switch by using FTP, SFTP, SCP, or HTTPs, or a USB device with the downloaded firmware. The firmwaredownload command supports both non-interactive and interactive modes.

In Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0, the command exposes the server password in clear text in theSupportSave file when it is collected. The issue is fixed in Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0a, therefore a migration to/from Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0a and later versions will not log passwords or sensitive data when the command is executed through the CLI, REST API or the web interface non-interactively.

**Products Affected**

Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0.

**Note for Brocade Fabric OS v9.1.1x downgrades**

Should the Brocade Switch be downgraded from v9.2.0 to v9.1.1x or any earlier version of FOS, using the CLI in non-interactive mode ie the whole command line, the password could be exposed in SupportSave file.

**Products Confrimed Not Affected**

Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to v9.2.0 are not affected.

**Workaround**

The workaround is to use the web interface of REST API or to run the “firmwaredownload “ command in interactive mode.

**Solution**

Solution provided in Brocade Fabric OS v9.2.0a and later versions.

**Credit**

The issue was found during internal penetration testing
