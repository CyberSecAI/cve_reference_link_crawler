{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The URL validation mechanism in Zitadel actions can be bypassed by creating a DNS record that resolves to 127.0.0.1. The isHostBlocked check, intended to block requests to localhost (127.0.0.1), is circumvented.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of hostnames in URL requests within Zitadel actions.",
      "The application relies on a simple check for IP addresses to block localhost, which is bypassed by using a custom DNS entry that resolves to a local IP."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to internal endpoints, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionalities by allowing actions to send requests to localhost or other restricted IPs via a DNS bypass.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker by controlling a DNS record."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a DNS record that resolves to 127.0.0.1 and also needs high privileges within Zitadel to define and use actions.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability allows bypassing restrictions designed to prevent actions from making requests to localhost. By creating a DNS record resolving to 127.0.0.1, an attacker can trick Zitadel's actions into sending requests to this address, potentially accessing sensitive debug endpoints and exfiltrating data. The fix involves improving the host validation to account for DNS-based bypasses. The provided content includes proof of concept code demonstrating the exploitation and its fix."
