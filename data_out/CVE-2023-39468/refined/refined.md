Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an exposed dangerous function within the Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. Specifically, it's related to how the `DbasSectorFileToExecuteOnReset` parameter is handled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core weakness is an exposed dangerous function that can be abused.
- The software allows the `DbasSectorFileToExecuteOnReset` parameter to be manipulated in a way that results in arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- The attacker gains code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- This could lead to complete compromise of the affected SCADA system, including control over industrial processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the system.
- The vulnerability is triggered through manipulation of the `DbasSectorFileToExecuteOnReset` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the SCADA Data Gateway to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how to manipulate the `DbasSectorFileToExecuteOnReset` parameter to achieve code execution.

**Additional details:**
- Triangle MicroWorks has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2023-04-06 and a coordinated public release of advisory was made on 2023-08-04.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Uri Katz of Claroty Team82.
