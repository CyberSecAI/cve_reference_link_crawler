Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-37481.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Fides webserver was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to insufficient checks on uploaded files, specifically SVG files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The application lacked proper validation of SVG files, allowing the upload of malicious SVG files, also known as "SVG bombs," containing XML entities that can lead to resource exhaustion.
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a user uploads a zip file containing a malicious SVG file as an icon for a new connector template.
-  The application did not properly sanitize or limit the processing of the uploaded SVG content, leading to the possibility of a "billion laughs attack" and `xlink` usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in resource exhaustion in the Admin UI browser tabs.
- It causes a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`).

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack vector through the Fides webserver's file upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope. This includes root users and users with the owner role.
- The attacker must be able to upload zip files containing malicious SVG files.
- The attacker can perform the upload via the `datastore-connection/new` page.
