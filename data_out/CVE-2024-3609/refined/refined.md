Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3609

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `reviewx_remove_guest_image` function of the ReviewX plugin. This function is responsible for deleting attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a proper capability check before allowing the execution of the `reviewx_remove_guest_image` function. This means that the function can be accessed by users who should not have permission to delete attachments.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to delete arbitrary attachments using an ID is an indication of an insecure direct object reference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Deletion:** An attacker can delete attachments associated with reviews.
- **Integrity Loss:** This can lead to a loss of data integrity, potentially harming the user experience and potentially causing issues with product reviews on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
- **Web interface:** The attacker interacts with the website interface, likely through AJAX requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to have at least 'subscriber' level access to the wordpress site.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable function is `reviewx_remove_guest_image` in `app/Controllers/Storefront/ReviewxPublic.php`.
- The fix implemented in version 1.6.28 includes adding `if (!current_user_can('manage_options'))` check at the beginning of the `reviewx_remove_guest_image` function to ensure only users with `manage_options` capabilities (typically administrators) can execute it.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.6.27.
- The function uses `check_ajax_referer` which is present, but does not prevent the vulnerability because the access control check is missing.
