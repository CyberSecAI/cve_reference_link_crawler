Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2456 (Although not explicitly stated, the file path `gitlab-org/cves/-/blob/master/2022/CVE-2022-2456.json` indicates this is likely the correct CVE).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GitLab handles visibility level changes for projects and groups. Specifically, the permission check is performed *after* determining if the new visibility level is different from the current one. The `level_value` method parses the user-supplied visibility level. If an arbitrary string is passed, it defaults to 0 (private), which bypasses the check that prevents a maintainer from changing visibility. Later on the arbitrary string will be parsed to an int that is used as the new visibility level, e.g. "20r" becomes 20 which corresponds to `PUBLIC`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Check Order:** The application checks if the new visibility level is different from the current one before checking if the user has permission to change the visibility level.
- **Type Confusion in Visibility Level Parsing:** The method `level_value` attempts to convert visibility levels based on string or integer values, but it doesn't properly validate the input before processing it. This allows for an attacker to input values that default to private during permission checks but are later parsed into public/internal.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `level_value` function doesn't properly sanitize input leading to the bypass of security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Visibility Changes:** A maintainer, who should not have the permission to change a project's or group's visibility level, can change it to a less restrictive level (e.g., from private to public). This can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
- **Data Exposure:** By making a private project public, sensitive code, data, or configurations can be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `project[visibility_level]` parameter in the web request to an arbitrary string such as "20r".
- **API Manipulation:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability likely affects the API as well.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Maintainer Role:** The attacker must have maintainer access to the targeted project or group.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GitLab instance.
- **Ability to Intercept and Modify Web Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify the HTTP requests made to the GitLab instance (e.g., using a tool like Burp Suite).

**Additional Notes**

- The report includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability using Burp Suite to modify the request.
- The report mentions that both Projects and Groups are affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in Self-managed GitLab instances and on gitlab.com.
