Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-6664

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the Distinct TFTP server. This allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The server does not properly sanitize filenames, allowing ".." sequences to navigate outside the intended directory.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can leverage the path traversal vulnerability to write files to any location on the filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By writing a malicious executable (e.g., to a location like `C:\Windows\System32\`) and a MOF file, the attacker gains the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system in the context of 'SYSTEM'. This leads to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **TFTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited through the TFTP protocol using a malicious client that can send write requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TFTP server.
- **TFTP Client:** The attacker requires a TFTP client to send the malicious requests.
- **Knowledge of File System:** The attacker needs knowledge of common windows system paths to write malicious files.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit leverages the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) MOF functionality by writing a malicious MOF file to `%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\wbem\mof`. When the WMI service processes the MOF, it executes the payload.
- The exploit uses the Metasploit framework to automate the process of writing executable files and the corresponding MOF configuration.

**Affected Product(s):**
- Distinct Intranet Servers version 3.10 on Windows is vulnerable according to exploit-db.
- Fortiguard indicates Distinct Intranet Servers version 3.01.
