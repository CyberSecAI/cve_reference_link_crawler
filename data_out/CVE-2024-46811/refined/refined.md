Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-46811.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fpu_update_bw_bounding_box` function within the AMD display driver. The function iterates through `bw_params->clk_table.entries` to populate `dram_speed_mts`. The `num_states` variable, representing the number of DPM (Dynamic Power Management) states, can exceed the size of the `bw_params->clk_table.entries` array, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Specifically, `soc.num_states` could be 40, while the array `bw_params->clk_table.entries` only has a range of 8.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code attempts to read beyond the bounds of the `bw_params->clk_table.entries` array. This occurs when the `num_states` variable exceeds `MAX_NUM_DPM_LVL` which is 8.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly stated, but an out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to a kernel crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior if exploited, since it's reading from memory outside the bounds of the intended array.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the display driver, specifically the function `fpu_update_bw_bounding_box` in `dcn302_fpu.c`, `dcn303_fpu.c`, `dcn32_fpu.c`, and `dcn321_fpu.c`. Triggering this function with a specific `clk_bw_params` structure would be required to reach the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to influence the `clk_bw_params` structure passed to the `fpu_update_bw_bounding_box` function, specifically the number of DPM states, so that `num_states` can exceed the size of `bw_params->clk_table.entries`. This would likely require some form of privileged access or control over the display subsystem.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix introduces an assertion (`ASSERT(0)`) that halts the execution if the number of states exceeds the maximum allowed. This prevents the out-of-bounds read by stopping the function when the condition is met.
- The fix is present in multiple files: `dcn302_fpu.c`, `dcn303_fpu.c`, `dcn32_fpu.c`, and `dcn321_fpu.c`
- The code comments clarify that `MAX_NUM_DPM_LVL` is 8, while the `DC__VOLTAGE_STATES` can be 40 which explains the potential for overflow, if not handled correctly.
