# CVE-2024-38808: Spring Expression DoS Vulnerability

MEDIUM | AUGUST 14, 2024 | CVE-2024-38808
# Description

In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.38 and older unsupported versions, it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression that may cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when the following is true:

* The application evaluates user-supplied SpEL expressions.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Framework
  + 5.3.0 to 5.3.38
  + Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

| Affected version(s) | Fix version | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.3.x | 5.3.39 | OSS |

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: 5.3.x users should upgrade to 5.3.39+ or 6.0+. Evaluation of user-supplied SpEL expressions should be avoided when possible; otherwise, user-supplied SpEL expressions should be evaluated with a `SimpleEvaluationContext` in read-only mode. No other steps are necessary.

Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Framework
  + 5.3.39+
  + 6.0+
