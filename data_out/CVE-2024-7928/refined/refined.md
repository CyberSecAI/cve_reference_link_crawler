Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of the `lang` parameter within the `index/ajax/lang` endpoint in FastAdmin. This allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `lang` parameter, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, database credentials, source code, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/index/ajax/lang` endpoint.
*   **`lang` Parameter Manipulation:** The `lang` parameter in the GET request is manipulated to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FastAdmin instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information indicates the exploit can be performed without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/index/ajax/lang`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `lang`
*   **Payload Example:** `GET /index/ajax/lang?lang=../../application/database HTTP/1.1`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of FastAdmin prior to V1.3.4.20220530.
*   The vendor has released a security update to address this issue.
*   The provided POC demonstrates how to read the database configuration file.
*   The vulnerability is rated as a medium risk.
