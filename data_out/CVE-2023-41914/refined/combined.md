```
Slurm versions 23.02.6 and 22.05.10 are now available to address a
number of filesystem race conditions that could let an attacker take
control of an arbitrary file, or remove entire directories' contents
(CVE-2023-41914).

SchedMD customers were informed on September 27th and provided a patch
on request; this process is documented in our security policy [1].

--------
CVE-2023-41914:

A number of race conditions have been identified within the
slurmd/slurmstepd processes that can lead to the user taking ownership
of an arbitrary file on the system. A related issue can lead to the user
overwriting an arbitrary file on the compute node (although with data
that is not directly under their control). A related issue can also lead
to the user deleting all files and sub-directories of an arbitrary
target directory on the compute node.

Thank you to François Diakhate (CEA) for reporting the original issue to
us. A number of related issues were found during an extensive audit of
Slurm's filesystem handling code in reaction to that report, and are
included here in this same disclosure.
--------

SchedMD only issues security fixes for the supported releases (currently
23.02 and 22.05). Due to the complexity of these fixes, we do not
recommend attempting to backport the fixes to older releases, and
strongly encourage sites to upgrade to fixed versions immediately.

Downloads are available at <https://www.schedmd.com/downloads.php> .

Release notes follow below.

> * Changes in Slurm 23.02.6
> ==========================
>  -- Fix CpusPerTres= not upgreadable with scontrol update
>  -- Fix unintentional gres removal when validating the gres job state.
>  -- Fix --without-hpe-slingshot configure option.
>  -- Fix cgroup v2 memory calculations when transparent huge pages are used.
>  -- Fix parsing of sgather --timeout option.
>  -- Fix regression from 22.05.0 that caused srun --cpu-bind "=verbose" and "=v"
>     options give different CPU bind masks.
>  -- Fix "_find_node_record: lookup failure for node" error message appearing
>     for all dynamic nodes during reconfigure.
>  -- Avoid segfault if loading serializer plugin fails.
>  -- slurmrestd - Correct OpenAPI format for 'GET /slurm/v0.0.39/licenses'.
>  -- slurmrestd - Correct OpenAPI format for 'GET /slurm/v0.0.39/job/{job_id}'.
>  -- slurmrestd - Change format to multiple fields in 'GET
>     /slurmdb/v0.0.39/assocations' and 'GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/qos' to handle
>     infinite and unset states.
>  -- When a node fails in a job with --no-kill, preserve the extern step on the
>     remaining nodes to avoid breaking features that rely on the extern step
>     such as pam_slurm_adopt, x11, and job_container/tmpfs.
>  -- auth/jwt - Ignore 'x5c' field in JWKS files.
>  -- auth/jwt - Treat 'alg' field as optional in JWKS files.
>  -- Allow job_desc.selinux_context to be read from the job_submit.lua script.
>  -- Skip check in slurmstepd that causes a large number of errors in the munge
>     log: "Unauthorized credential for client UID=0 GID=0".  This error will
>     still appear on slurmd/slurmctld/slurmdbd start up and is not a cause for
>     concern.
>  -- slurmctld - Allow startup with zero partitions.
>  -- Fix some mig profile names in slurm not matching nvidia mig profiles.
>  -- Prevent slurmscriptd processing delays from blocking other threads in
>     slurmctld while trying to launch {Prolog|Epilog}Slurmctld.
>  -- Fix sacct printing ReqMem field when memory doesn't exist in requested TRES.
>  -- Fix how heterogenous steps in an allocation with CR_PACK_NODE or -mpack are
>     created.
>  -- Fix slurmctld crash from race condition within job_submit_throttle plugin.
>  -- Fix --with-systemdsystemunitdir when requesting a default location.
>  -- Fix not being able to cancel an array task by the jobid (i.e. not
>     <jobid>_<taskid>) through scancel, job launch failure or prolog failure.
>  -- Fix cancelling the whole array job when the array task is the meta job and
>     it fails job or prolog launch and is not requeable. Cancel only the
>     specific task instead.
>  -- Fix regression in 21.08.2 where MailProg did not run for mail-type=end for
>     jobs with non-zero exit codes.
>  -- Fix incorrect setting of memory.swap.max in cgroup/v2.
>  -- Fix jobacctgather/cgroup collection of disk/io, gpumem, gpuutil TRES values.
>  -- Fix -d singleton for heterogeneous jobs.
>  -- Downgrade info logs about a job meeting a "maximum node limit" in the
>     select plugin to DebugFlags=SelectType. These info logs could spam the
>     slurmctld log file under certain circumstances.
>  -- prep/script - Fix [Srun|Task]<Prolog|Epilog> missing SLURM_JOB_NODELIST.
>  -- gres - Rebuild GRES core bitmap for nodes at startup. This fixes error:
>     "Core bitmaps size mismatch on node [HOSTNAME]", which causes jobs to enter
>     state "Requested node configuration is not available".
>  -- slurmctd - Allow startup with zero nodes.
>  -- Fix filesystem handling race conditions that could lead to an attacker
>     taking control of an arbitrary file, or removing entire directories'
>     contents. CVE-2023-41914.

# Security Policy

### SchedMD Slurm Security Response Process

SchedMD takes security seriously. We follow a coordinated disclosure process which is outlined below.

While we strongly encourage discoverers to report potential security issues to us and follow our disclosure process, we will respect their wishes and work with them in cases where their preferred process may vary.

[View Past Security Disclosures](/security-archive/)
#### Contact: security@schedmd.com

If required, please contact us for GPG keys.

#### Scope:

This process covers the Slurm workload manager itself. Issues with closely related components — such as MUNGE or third-party SPANK plugins — may be raised with us and we will work with the reporter to identify the appropriate contacts and coordinate disclosure.

#### Slurm Vulnerability Disclosure Process:

1. Problem identification and triage.
   1. The issue is identified, and the code base reviewed for similar and related issues.
   2. Potential mitigations and related configuration options identified.
   3. Fix is developed and tested internally.
   4. A CVE number is requested, identifying the original problem reporter. Details are not released until the end of the embargo period.
2. Pre-advisory embargo period and SchedMD customer notification
   1. Pre-advisory announcement is made to the private SchedMD customer mailing list, and any mitigations and patches are made available upon further request.
   2. Customers requesting fixes and further details on the issue are required to adhere to the embargo period, and not disclose the issue outside of their operational staff and management.
   3. If maintenance outages are required and require notification of system users, we request that customers do not identify the specific issue that is leading to that maintenance outage.
   4. Any fixes prepared in response will not be applied to the main SchedMD/slurm Git distribution until the embargo period has expired.
   5. SchedMD may, at its discretion, notify external Slurm package maintainers (e.g., Debian, EPEL, FreeBSD) during this embargo period that a security fix will be published on the established end of the embargo period. Such notification will not include specifics of the issue, only that a security issue will be leading to the publication of new releases.
   6. In most circumstances, the embargo expiration will be set for two weeks after customer notification.
   7. If, in SchedMD’s opinion, details of the issue have been made publically available, the embargo period may end earlier than the scheduled date.
3. Advisory public release:
   1. Public release is generally made in conjunction with publication of the next maintenance release of all supported branches. (Currently, this is the major releases made within the past 18 months, which corresponds to the last two major releases.)
   2. Notification is made to the slurm-announce and slurm-users lists of the immediate availability of the fixed releases, alongside disclosure of the security issue they address.
   3. All vulnerable releases will be removed from public download on SchedMD’s website.
