Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of restrictions on the use of custom `SocketImpl` in OpenJDK.  Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the Java Security Manager does not properly restrict the ability to create custom `SocketImpl` subclasses which can then be used to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The primary weakness lies in the insufficient restrictions on creating custom SocketImpl subclasses.
*   **Sandbox bypass:** The ability to create a custom SocketImpl could lead to bypassing Java sandbox restrictions, a core security feature of the Java runtime environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox escape:** By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially bypass the Java sandbox, gaining access to resources and operations that are normally restricted. This could allow for arbitrary code execution or other attacks.
*   **Information disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, a successful sandbox escape could potentially lead to access sensitive information that would otherwise be protected by the sandbox.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is in the networking component, and exploitation would likely involve network communication.
*   **Custom SocketImpl creation:** The attacker would need to create a Java class that extends `SocketImpl`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious Java class:**  The attacker needs to be able to create or inject a Java class that implements a custom `SocketImpl` subclass.
*   **Network access:** Network access is required to communicate using the custom `SocketImpl` implementation and exploit any networking related impacts.
*   **Exploitation of a Java Application:** The attacker would need to have a way to deploy or execute the specially crafted Java class on a system running vulnerable OpenJDK code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in multiple security advisories from Red Hat, Debian, and openSUSE, indicating widespread impact on various distributions.
*   The fix involves applying security updates to the `java-1.x.0-openjdk` packages where x is 7 or 8, and also `java-11-openjdk`, indicating a problem in the networking stack used in all OpenJDK versions.
*   The vulnerability has a moderate severity rating in Red Hat advisories and important rating for the fix from debian and openSUSE, suggesting it is considered a notable security risk.
* The Red Hat advisories note that running instances of the vulnerable Java runtime must be restarted after patching to ensure that the fix is applied.

In summary, CVE-2019-2945 allows a malicious user to potentially escape the Java sandbox by creating and using a custom `SocketImpl` implementation due to a lack of proper restrictions in OpenJDK. This could lead to various security risks including information disclosure, partial denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
