The provided content is related to CVE-2024-2057.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the deserialization of a `TFIDFRetriever` object from an untrusted source, which could contain a malicious payload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization of `TFIDFRetriever` objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious payload within a serialized `TFIDFRetriever` object. The precise impact is not detailed but it is likely to allow for remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Deserialization of a malicious payload embedded within a `TFIDFRetriever` object from an untrusted source.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious serialized `TFIDFRetriever` object to be deserialized by a victim using the vulnerable `TFIDFRetriever`.
