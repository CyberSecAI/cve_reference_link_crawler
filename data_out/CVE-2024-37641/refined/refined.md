Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-37641
*   **Product:** TRENDnet TEW-814DAP Firmware Version: v1\_(FW1.01B01)
*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `/formNewSchedule` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `send_redirect_perm` function copies the value of the `submit-url` parameter into a buffer using `sprintf` without checking the length of the input.
*  **Weaknesses:** Missing input validation, specifically lack of bounds checking when copying the `submit-url` parameter into a fixed-size buffer.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DDoS) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by sending a crafted request with an oversized `submit-url` parameter, overwriting the stack.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formNewSchedule` endpoint with a large value for the `submit-url` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and must be able to send HTTP POST requests. It's also likely the attacker needs a valid session cookie.

**Additional details:**
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) Python script demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `send_redirect_perm` function which processes the `submit-url` parameter.
