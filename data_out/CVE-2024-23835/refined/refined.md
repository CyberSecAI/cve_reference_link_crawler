Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23835:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a quadratic complexity issue in the PostgreSQL (pgsql) parsing logic within Suricata. Specifically, when parsing multiple small Protocol Data Units (PDUs) within a larger chunk of data, the parser could exhibit a quadratic time complexity, leading to excessive memory consumption. This was due to the parser not properly restricting itself to the length of the current PDU and using the remaining buffer (rest) instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Quadratic Time Complexity:** The core weakness is the inefficient algorithm used for parsing, leading to a quadratic relationship between input size and processing time/memory usage.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The quadratic complexity issue causes excessive memory allocation, potentially leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition and application crashes.
- **Improper Input Handling**: The vulnerability occurs because the parser did not limit itself to the length of the current PDU, overconsuming memory by using the remainder of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted PostgreSQL traffic containing a large number of small PDUs. This would cause excessive memory consumption within Suricata, leading to a crash and effectively denying service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious network traffic containing crafted PostgreSQL messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Suricata with the pgsql app layer parser enabled.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs to be able to craft packets that contain multiple small PDUs, which triggers the quadratic complexity issue.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by OSS-Fuzz using quadfuzz.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by commit `f52c033e566beafb4480c139eb18662a2870464f` and `86de7cffa7e8f06fe9d600127e7dabe89c7e81dd`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the parser only processes the current PDU's length and doesn't use the rest of the buffer.
*   The vulnerability affects Suricata versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.2 and was patched in version 7.0.3.
*   A workaround is to disable the pgsql app layer parser.
*   The issue is tracked as issue #6411 in the Suricata Redmine instance.
