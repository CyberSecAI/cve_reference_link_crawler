Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-47384.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `w83793` hardware monitoring driver. This occurs when the driver reads a specific value from the device that satisfies the condition `(tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7))`. In this scenario, the `lm75` array within the `w83793_data` structure can be accessed even when the device has not been initialized properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The driver uses a structure member, `lm75`, to store the dummy devices created with `devm_i2c_new_dummy_device`. However, after the driver switched to use the device manager for creating dummy devices, the `lm75` array became unnecessary. The driver attempts to access the `lm75` members even if a device was not properly created, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A NULL pointer dereference results in the kernel crashing, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can cause the vulnerability by manipulating the register value returned by the W83793 chip. Specifically, the attacker needs to cause the condition mentioned above (i.e., `(tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7))`) to be true when the `w83793_detect_subclients` function reads `W83793_REG_I2C_SUBADDR`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have the ability to cause the vulnerable driver to read a manipulated value from a W83793 device through the i2c interface.
