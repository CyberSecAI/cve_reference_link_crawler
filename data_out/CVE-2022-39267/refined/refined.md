- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses the presence of the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to determine if a request should be subject to authentication checks. By removing this header, an attacker can bypass the authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to reliance on a client-controlled header for security decisions. The vulnerability is that the authentication mechanism is not robust and depends on the presence of the `X-Requested-With` header, which is easily manipulated by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated users can access admin and monitor user groups' functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted request without the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position or prior access is required, meaning a remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
