SUMMARY

SINEMA Remote Connect Server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including

• A cross-site scripting vulnerability in an error message pop up window (CVE-2022-29034)
• Several authentication bypass, privilege escalation and integrity check vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-

32251 through -32261)

• A command injection vulnerability in the file upload service (CVE-2022-32262)
• A chosen-plaintext attack against HTTP over TLS ("BREACH”, CVE-2022-27221)
• Information disclosure vulnerabilities in the curl component (CVE-2021-22924 through -22925)
• Several vulnerabilities in the libexpat library, that could be exploited when the server is parsing
untrusted XML files (CVE-2021-45960, CVE-2021-46143, CVE-2022-22822 through -22827, CVE-
2022-23852, CVE-2022-23990, CVE-2022-25235 through -25236, CVE-2022-25313 through -
25315.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEMA Remote Connect Server and recommends to update to
the latest version. Note that the update also contains additional fixes for vulnerabilities documented in
Siemens Security Advisories SSA-244969, SSA-539476, SSA-685781 and SSA-712929.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively, which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all,
and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer cert’
which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.
