Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formWifiMacFilterSet` function of the Tenda i21 router firmware. This occurs because the function uses the user-supplied `ssidIndex` parameter from a POST request without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string without checking the length of the user-controlled `ssidIndex` parameter before writing it into the `mib_prefix` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is too large.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The software does not properly validate the length of the `ssidIndex` parameter before using it in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stack overflow:** An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack memory, potentially including return addresses, allowing them to gain control over the execution flow of the program.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully crafting the payload, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `formWifiMacFilterSet` function.
- **`ssidIndex` parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `ssidIndex` parameter in the POST request with a large string to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device, which implies they have network connectivity to the device (either local network or potentially from the internet if the device is exposed).
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint (`formWifiMacFilterSet`).

**Additional details:**
- **Affected Firmware:** Tenda i21 V1.0.0.14(4656).
- **Vulnerable code:** The `sprintf(mib_prefix, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);` line is the vulnerable piece of code.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** A python code snippet demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a POST request with a large payload in the `ssidIndex` parameter.

The provided information gives a clear description of the vulnerability, the cause, impact, attack vector, and required attacker capabilities, and includes a POC.
