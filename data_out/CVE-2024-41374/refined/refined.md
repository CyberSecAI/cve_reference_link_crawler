- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application takes user-controlled input from the `$_GET['tab']` parameter and directly embeds it into the `onload` attribute of the `<body>` tag in `lib/settings-screen.php` without any sanitization or encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a `tab` parameter containing JavaScript code, such as `GET /lib/settings-screen.php?tab=style%27)%22%20onerror=%22alert(%27xss%27)%22%20(%27&csrf=f64d3d95dc4af18766d285ff437e4d4f`. The attacker would need to get the victim to click the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and entice a user to click on it. They do not need privileged access or to be on the local network.
