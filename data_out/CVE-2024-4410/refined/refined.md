### CVE-2024-4410
This CVE relates to a missing authorization vulnerability in the IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding Platform WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks capability checks on various functions called via AJAX actions in the `class-idf-wizard.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** Authenticated users with minimal privileges (subscriber or higher) can execute AJAX actions intended for administrators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker with subscriber level access could perform actions such as:
    *   Change the permalink structure of the WordPress site
    *   Modify plugin settings
    *   Other unauthorized administrative tasks.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending AJAX requests to specific endpoints in the `class-idf-wizard.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
*   The attacker must be able to craft and send AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
