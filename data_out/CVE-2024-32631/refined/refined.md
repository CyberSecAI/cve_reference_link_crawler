- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read occurs within the `ciCCIOTOPT` function, leading to incorrect computations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to incorrect computations and potentially affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Specifically, it has low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and high availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit this vulnerability and it has a high attack complexity.
