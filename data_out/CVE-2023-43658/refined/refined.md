{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper escaping of user-provided event titles when generating HTML for email previews.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into event titles. When a user views an email preview, the injected script executes, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, or other malicious activities. Note: This vulnerability is only exploitable if the Content Security Policy (CSP) is disabled on the forum, which is a non-default configuration.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious event title that includes JavaScript code." ,
      "The malicious event title is displayed in the 'email preview' UI, where it executes due to lack of proper escaping."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create events with a malicious title. They need a low level of privilege on the target system.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a missing or insufficient output sanitization step when generating the HTML for event previews within emails. This allows the injected javascript to be executed due to the disabled CSP, which is not a default setting."
