- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formWriteFacMac` function in the Tenda F1202 firmware directly passes the user-supplied `mac` variable to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/goform/WriteFacMac` with a malicious payload in the `mac` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint on the router, implying network access to the device.
