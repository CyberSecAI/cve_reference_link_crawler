The provided content describes two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21905 and CVE-2021-21906) in Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module CMA Version 5.0. This response focuses on the details for CVE-2021-21906.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `checkPassword` function's use of `readfile` to fetch the password from `/ltrx_user/secret`. The `readfile` function copies data from the file into a fixed-size buffer without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `checkPassword` function.
- Unsafe use of `readfile` without bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. By overflowing the buffer in `checkPassword`, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and gain control of the program counter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must first gain the ability to modify the contents of `/ltrx_user/secret`, as mentioned, this can be achieved using CVE-2021-21905.
- Then the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending any password to the CLI password prompt, which will be passed to `checkPassword`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must be able to interact with the CLI over TCP port 6877 and send a password.
- Attacker needs to be able to modify the contents of the `/ltrx_user/secret` file, which could be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability like CVE-2021-21905.
