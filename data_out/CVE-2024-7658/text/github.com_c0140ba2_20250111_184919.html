Folders! Finally, the most requested feature is available. At the moment folders and subfolders can be created, rearranged by drag&drop and will be presented in all templates together with a breadcrumbs trail for easy navigation. There's much to do yet (select multiple, make an entire folder public, etc) but this basic implementation should give a great starting point.

Added Option to show public files on clients files lists

Added link to download translations to the languages dropdown

Fixed preview of video files (by Nimon77)

Sanitize svg files uploaded in settings pages

Include local version of jQuery on templates

Admin pages improvement: check user session before starting to process data

Do not load google's recaptcha js asset if recaptcha is disabled

Fix double "x" in close modal button (by rob4226)

FIxed showing validation errors when creating a client/user fails

Fix error 500 when self registering
