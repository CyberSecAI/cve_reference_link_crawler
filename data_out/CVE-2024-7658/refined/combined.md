[`0189243`](/projectsend/projectsend/commit/01892437a4b133f84864b0fb83ddf85efac2d5a9)

Folders! Finally, the most requested feature is available. At the moment folders and subfolders can be created, rearranged by drag&drop and will be presented in all templates together with a breadcrumbs trail for easy navigation. There's much to do yet (select multiple, make an entire folder public, etc) but this basic implementation should give a great starting point.

Added Option to show public files on clients files lists

Added link to download translations to the languages dropdown

Fixed php >8 warnings

Allow underscores on usernames

Fixed 2FA token not validating due to php and mysql time differences.

Allow svg files as branding image

Manage files: show file assigned categories

Added option "Do not log downloads by the file's uploader"

Added an option to organize file uploads in year/month folders

Add support for Env vars for SMTP Configuration (by redondi88, [see variables here](https://github.com/projectsend/projectsend/commit/26fc23e31d96efa684369ca7b31fc2bbea29479a))

add aliases or virtual links for uploaded files (by mhpcc)

Fixed preview of video files (by Nimon77)

Sanitize svg files uploaded in settings pages

Include local version of jQuery on templates

Admin pages improvement: check user session before starting to process data

Do not load google's recaptcha js asset if recaptcha is disabled

Fix double "x" in close modal button (by rob4226)

Fix: Extended remote\_ip field on downloads table for long ipv6 addresses

FIxed showing validation errors when creating a client/user fails

Fix error 500 when self registering

Fixed XSS when changing template

fix upgrade failure when table prefix isn't tbl\_ (by mhpcc)

Fixed getting links of previews by users with no access to the file (found by hassan al-khafaji and kiyell)

Fixed insecure strings being generated by a simple random string function (found by hassan al-khafaji)

Updated dependencies with known security issues (ie CKEditor5)
