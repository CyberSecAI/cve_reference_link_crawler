Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-4993:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the `/show.php` script, specifically within the handling of the query parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the application is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by another user. In this specific case, the attacker could send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user. If the user clicks the malicious link, the injected script can steal the user's cookie session credentials. This can allow the attacker to hijack the victim's session and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `show.php` query parameter. The victim must click on the malicious URL to trigger the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link. The target user must be an authenticated user of the SiAdmin application and needs to click the provided link.
