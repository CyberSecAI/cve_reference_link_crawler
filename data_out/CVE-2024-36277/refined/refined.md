Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36277:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper verification of cryptographic signatures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly verify cryptographic signatures of event data. This could lead to the application accepting data with invalid signatures.

**Impact of exploitation:** The affected app cannot detect event data with invalid signatures. This could allow an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the application, though the specific impact is not detailed further.

**Attack vectors:** Network based attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted event data to the application which could be done by a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack.
