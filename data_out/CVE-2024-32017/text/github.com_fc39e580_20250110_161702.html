# Buffer overflows in RIOT /sys/net/application\_layer/gcoap/

Critical

## Package

RIOT

## Affected versions

<= 2023.10

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

I spotted a typo in a size check that may lead to a buffer overflow in RIOT source code at:

<https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/gcoap/dns.c#L319-L325>

I also spotted another potential buffer overflow in RIOT source code at:

<https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/gcoap/forward_proxy.c#L352>

### Details

The size check in the `gcoap_dns_server_proxy_get()` function contains a small typo that may lead to a buffer overflow in the subsequent `strcpy()`. In detail, the length of the `_uri` string is checked instead of the length of the `_proxy` string.

Please refer to the marked lines below:

```
ssize_t gcoap_dns_server_proxy_get(char *proxy, size_t proxy_len)
{
    ssize_t res = 0;
    mutex_lock(&_client_mutex);
    if (_dns_server_uri_isset()) {
        res = strlen(_uri); // VULN: typo, should be strlen(_proxy)
        if (((size_t)res + 1) > proxy_len) {
            /* account for trailing \0 */
            res = -ENOBUFS;
        }
        else {
            strcpy(proxy, _proxy); // VULN: potential buffer overflow
        }
    }
    mutex_unlock(&_client_mutex);
    return res;
}
```

The `_gcoap_forward_proxy_copy_options()` function does not implement an explicit size check before copying data to the `cep->req_etag` buffer that is `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX` bytes long. If an attacker can craft input so that `optlen` becomes larger than `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX`, they can cause a buffer overflow.

Please refer to the marked line below:

```
static int _gcoap_forward_proxy_copy_options(coap_pkt_t *pkt,
                                             coap_pkt_t *client_pkt,
                                             client_ep_t *cep,
                                             uri_parser_result_t *urip)
{
    /* copy all options from client_pkt to pkt */
    coap_optpos_t opt = {0, 0};
    uint8_t *value;
    bool uri_path_added = false;
    bool etag_added = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < client_pkt->options_len; i++) {
        ssize_t optlen = coap_opt_get_next(client_pkt, &opt, &value, !i);
        /* wrt to ETag option slack: we always have at least the Proxy-URI option in the client_pkt,
         * so we should hit at least once (and it's opt_num is also >= COAP_OPT_ETAG) */
        if (optlen >= 0) {
            if (IS_USED(MODULE_NANOCOAP_CACHE) && !etag_added && (opt.opt_num >= COAP_OPT_ETAG)) {
                static const uint8_t tmp[COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX] = { 0 };
                /* add slack to maybe add an ETag on stale cache hit later, as is done in
                 * gcoap_req_send() (which we circumvented in _gcoap_forward_proxy_via_coap()) */
                if (coap_opt_add_opaque(pkt, COAP_OPT_ETAG, tmp, sizeof(tmp))) {
                    etag_added = true;
                }
            }
            if (IS_USED(MODULE_NANOCOAP_CACHE) && opt.opt_num == COAP_OPT_ETAG) {
                if (_cep_get_req_etag_len(cep) == 0) {
                    /* TODO: what to do on multiple ETags? */
                    _cep_set_req_etag_len(cep, (uint8_t)optlen);
#if IS_USED(MODULE_NANOCOAP_CACHE)
                    /* req_tag in cep is pre-processor guarded so we need to as well */
                    memcpy(cep->req_etag, value, optlen); // VULN: potential buffer overflow if optlen can become larger than COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX
#endif
...
```
