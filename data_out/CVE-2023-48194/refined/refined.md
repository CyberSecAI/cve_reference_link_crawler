{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda AC8v4 router firmware due to the use of `sscanf` without proper bounds checking.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Uncontrolled format string",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting the gp register. Successful exploitation can give the attacker complete control of the device.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint.",
      "Crafted `list` parameter with a specific length and injected address."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker must be on the same network as the router, or have network access to the router.",
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface."
    ],
      "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `sscanf` function parses user-supplied input into a fixed-size buffer without verifying the length of the input, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the function handling the `list` parameter of the `SetNetControlList` form. When processing this parameter, the `sscanf` function writes into a small buffer, and by providing input that exceeds the buffer's capacity, the attacker can overwrite the adjacent memory including the return address and gp register. This specific exploit overwrites the last digit of `s8` with `\x0`, and sets the `gp` register. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger a crash."
