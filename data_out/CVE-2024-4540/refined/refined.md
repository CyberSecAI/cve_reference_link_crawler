Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of client-provided parameters in plain text within the `KC_RESTART` cookie. This occurs during the processing of OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) when a `request_uri` is used for authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information present in client-provided parameters is exposed in the `KC_RESTART` cookie.
- **Lack of Encryption/Obfuscation:** The parameters are not encrypted or obfuscated when stored in the cookie, leading to potential exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who can intercept or access the `KC_RESTART` cookie could potentially obtain sensitive information, leading to:
- **Exposure of client data/parameters**
- **Potential for unauthorized access or further attacks.**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker may intercept network traffic to capture the `KC_RESTART` cookie during the authorization process.
- **Cookie Access:** An attacker with access to the victim's browser cookies could obtain the sensitive parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept network requests to obtain the cookie.
- **Access to Browser Cookies:** The attacker needs to gain access to the victim's browser cookies.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat products, including:
- Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 (various RHEL versions)
- Red Hat build of Keycloak (versions 22.0.11 and 24.0.5)
- Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat.
- The fix involves updating Red Hat Single Sign-On and Red Hat build of Keycloak to versions where this issue is resolved.
- Red Hat has issued multiple security advisories (RHSA) to address this vulnerability in different products and versions.
- The provided content includes multiple RHSA's (RHSA-2024:3566, RHSA-2024:3567, RHSA-2024:3568, RHSA-2024:3570, RHSA-2024:3572, RHSA-2024:3573, RHSA-2024:3574, RHSA-2024:3575, RHSA-2024:3576) which all refer to the same underlying issue (CVE-2024-4540).
