- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WebinarPress plugin versions <= 1.33.20 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to induce higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force authenticated users, especially those with higher privileges, to execute unintended actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by exploiting the absence of CSRF protection. The attacker needs to trick a logged in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it. No specific privileges are mentioned as being required for the attacker. The attacker can be unauthenticated.
