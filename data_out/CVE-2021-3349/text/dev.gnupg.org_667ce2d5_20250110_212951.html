# Description

FWIU, currently --verify considers a signature trusted if it is made using a key that has at least one trusted UID. This is suboptimal for batch checking since it means that a person whose identity I've verified in the past can add a forged UID and while it will be untrusted, a lot of programs will happily assume that the signature is trusted.

Of course, this currently be solved at program level. However, it's quite inconvenient (a lot of plumbing work in the end), and upstreams actively refuse to do it. For example, Evolution maintainers closed [a report of this problem](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution/issues/299), claiming that changes on GnuPG must happen first.

I believe it would be helpful if GnuPG had an additional option to specify the apparent UID (e-mail address) that the signature is expected to originate from. If this option is used, GnuPG should consider a signature trusted only if the signing key has a matching UID and that UID is trusted. Otherwise, it should consider the signature untrusted even if the key is normally considered trusted.

For example:

```
$ gpg --verify test.gpg
gpg: Signature made Wed Oct 30 17:44:59 2019 CET
gpg:                using RSA key C76A845094098D28CC8B26C5639ADAE2329E240E
gpg: Good signature from "Michał Górny (Gentoo) <mgorny@gentoo.org>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "keybase.io/mgorny <mgorny@keybase.io>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "Michał Górny (XMPP) <mgorny@jabber.ru>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "Michał Górny (NetBSD) <mgorny@NetBSD.org>" [ultimate]
```

BUT if I did:

```
$ gpg --new-fancy-uid-option alice@example.com --verify test.gpg
```

it would report the signature as untrusted because alice@example.com is not a trusted UID on that key.

So you mean we should take the signer's UID (which can be part of the signature) into account when displaying the user id? Right now we display the primary UID followed by \_all\_ other user IDs so that the verifier has an overview of the associated user ids.

No. I mean to have an option for the caller to provide apparent UID in context to the --verify option, and have that influence the result. This is important for automated software that can't rely on user rechecking the result.

To be clear, i believe [@mgorny](/p/mgorny/) means that he wants the User ID containing the e-mail address to be considered \*valid\* (that is, full or ultimate validity). I don't think this operation should care about ownertrust.

We already have the option --sender which does what [@mgorny](/p/mgorny/) requests but only in the TOFU case. I need to revisit the system to see whether we can extend it to WoT and direct key signatures.

With the recent change the --sender option has an effect on the selection of the User ID used for the key validity check and the TRUST\_ status lines:

* If --sender is used the key used to create the signature must have a non-expired, non-revoked User-ID containing one of the mail addresses given by the sender options. That User ID is then used to compute the validity. If more than one User ID has a matching mail address and --sender value, the latest one is used.
* If the signature contains a Signer's UID sub-packet (e.g. created by using --sender with a sign command) and its value contains a valid mail address, a matching User ID is located in the key in the same way as above. The --sender restriction is applied in addition.

This is changes the behaviour of GnuPG but given that proper MUAs and other tools anyway fetch the signing key and do their own matching, the effect should be negotiable. In any case it make it easier to use gpg in a script to check signatures based on mail addresses. Some additional diagnostics are printed as well. The TRUST\_ lines will eventually be extended to also carry the corresponding mail address.

Some examples: Without any option and using a standard signature we get the same as in the past:

```
$ gpg -v --verify --status-fd 1 -o - a.simple.signed
[GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT 74 0
Scotty: Captain, we din' can reference it!
Kirk:   Analysis, Mr. Spock?

Spock:  Affirmative.
Kirk:   Mr. Sulu, go to pass two.
Sulu:   Aye aye, sir, going to pass two.

Note the TRUST\_FULLY because we have no information which User ID was used to issue the signature. Now let's see what happens now if the expected User ID is supplied (e.g. taken from a mail's From header):

Yep, TRUST is undefined. Now see what we get for a signature carrying a Signer's UID packet:

Could you do that, please?

I'm slightly against a backport as this is a behavior change for example KMail and GpgOL which use the --sender option might get different results after this change. I don't think it would be problematic but as said I have a slight preference against backporting because changing behavior of existing calls is better something for the new major release which is in its final steps for release anyway.
