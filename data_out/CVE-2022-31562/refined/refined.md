Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2022-31562.

**Content Analysis for CVE-2022-31562:**

Based on the provided information, only one entry directly relates to CVE-2022-31562. It is from the GitHub Advisory Database and it references the `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel` repository.

- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
  - The vulnerability is caused by the unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function in the `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel` repository.
  - Specifically, the vulnerability stems from not sanitizing the input provided to the `send_file` which allows an attacker to perform an absolute path traversal.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: This is the core weakness that is present, which allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
    

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem by manipulating the filename parameter, this includes the source code, configurations, and critical system files
    - The vulnerability leads to high confidentiality risk, a low risk of availability (a partial system denial service is possible), and no integrity risk
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
  - The attack has a low complexity and it does not require any privileges or user interaction to be exploited.
 

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  -  The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application.
  -  No user interaction or specific privileges are required.

**Additional details extracted from related issue #669**:
-   `flask.send_file` is unsafe when used with untrusted data.
-   `os.path.join` can be used to pass an absolute path to `flask.send_file`
-   Remediation can be performed by either using the `flask.safe_join` or replacing `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory`
