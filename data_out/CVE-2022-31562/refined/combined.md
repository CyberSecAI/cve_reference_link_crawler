# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# VideoServer

A python3 UPnP / DLNA video server

A bare essential video server for watching locally hosted mp4 files on a tv.

Requirements:

pip install Flask

Or for the Aiohttp version

pip intall aiohttp

pip intall aiohttp\_jinja2

pip intall async\_generator

Or for the Quart version ...a work in progress with some known issues...making it pretty unsable at the moment (Now that an aiohttp version exists this is probably dead).

pip intall aiofiles

pip install Quart

`[# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of send_file call](/porcupineyhairs/flask-mongo-skel/commit/0b1f1c2ab0712fe5563533240aef1de8948220e1 "# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. This attack is also known as “dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and “backtracking”.

## Root Cause Analysis

Passing untrusted input to `flask.send_file`can lead to path traversal attacks.

In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :
https://github.com/piaoyunsoft/bt_lnmp/blob/fa49519b04586a00e76c105e7ce1da36eadf6922/www/server/panel/BTPanel/__init__.py#L858

Here, the `filename` parameter is attacker controlled and is used as the filename passed to the `send_file` call. This leads to a path traversal attack.

## Remediation

This can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.

`[# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of send_file call](/porcupineyhairs/homepage/commit/c28c561dce2e8fa6d9a132275fff1557d44fa54b "# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. This attack is also known as “dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and “backtracking”.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path.  Please see the example below.
```
>>> import os.path
>>> static = \"path/to/mySafeStaticDir\"
>>> malicious = \"/../../../../../etc/passwd\"
>>> os.path.join(t,malicious)
'/../../../../../etc/passwd'
```
Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks.

In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :
https://github.com/nrlakin/homepage/blob/82ffb967f370bfe84b6e954a59022f37f4f105c1/home/frontend/views.py#L78

Here, the `filename` parameter is attacker controlled. This parameter passes through the unsafe `os.path.join` call making the effective directory and filename passed to the `send_file` call attacker controlled. This leads to a path traversal attack.

## Proof of Concept

The bug can be verified using a proof of concept similar to the one shown below.

```
curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/download//../../../../etc/passwd\"'
```
## Remediation

This can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.

`[# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of send_file call](/porcupineyhairs/equanimity/commit/62ccc57cf3aa7d2a63cdf6f2ca5af881a2c31e3e "# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. This attack is also known as “dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and “backtracking”.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path.  Please see the example below.
```
>>> import os.path
>>> static = \"path/to/mySafeStaticDir\"
>>> malicious = \"/../../../../../etc/passwd\"
>>> os.path.join(t,malicious)
'/../../../../../etc/passwd'
```
Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks.

In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :
https://github.com/AFDudley/equanimity/blob/16862abb282f174ceb7ca297c956565fcfb188ad/server/views/frontend.py#L25

Here, the `path` parameter is attacker controlled. This parameter passes through the unsafe `os.path.join` call making the effective directory and filename passed to the `send_file` call attacker controlled. This leads to a path traversal attack.

## Proof of Concept

The bug can be verified using a proof of concept similar to the one shown below.

```
curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/js//../../../../etc/passwd\"'
```
## Remediation

This can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.

| The GHSL team along with independent security researchers like me use tools like CodeQL to find security vulnerabilities in open source code.  👍  We try and recognise commonly occuring vulnerable patterns in codebases to prevent them from reoccuring.  👍  In this case, by perforing variant analysis, I found path traversal vulnerabilities in multiple projects. These were reported to their respective maintainers. Those who chose to fix them fixed them, those who didn't didn't.  👍  The entire reporting process was semi-automated and maintainers were given enough time before a disclosure was made.  👍  With each report, a CVE request was made so as to uniquely identify the issue.  👎 Projects that have no license, no vendor, no version, no release, no package, or no build do not deserve to have CVEs IMO. I feel responsible security researchers should understand the - well, responsibility - they have.  There is no scarcity of record numbers and there's no real harm in registering one.  👎 I disagree, it's just keeping systems and people busy needlessly. In some cases the amount of waste is significant.  folks who are here blaming me for their failing builds should understand that I am not the reason for their failed builds.  Yes and no. By reporting CVEs that shouldn't exist in the first place you triggered it. Of course you are not responsible for potential bugs in the ODC project ([jeremylong/DependencyCheck!4671](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/4671)). I feel that most people engaged in this discussion here do understand that perfectly well. |

| First, the issue of failing builds, folks who are here blaming me for their failing builds should understand that I am not the reason for their failed builds. The reason behind their failing builds is a bug in the OWASP dependency-check project. Please file a bug report with that project. To repeat, The builds are not failing because I am requesting CVE ids, they fail because the tooling you use is buggy.  OWASP dependency-check project is a best effort tool and only as good as the data it utilizes. It breaks up keywords from the vendor, project, and all the fields in the CPE to find matches. The more accurate the data is for the CVE, the more accurate the tool is (other tools too). We all deal with when these tools fail b/c it flags things it shouldn't, but usually the false-positives are against valid CVEs. I'm going to have NIST review all your CVEs. You filed junk data to the in NIST database - PEROID! It would be nice if you realized the mistake and help clean it up, but I guess not 🤷 |

| Hi all,  Thank you all for bringing this information to our attention. It seems like there was an error assigning the CPEs for some of the CVEs associated with this Bug Slayer submission. We have already conveyed the issue to NIST.  As for the applicability of these CVEs, we do not encourage participants to ask maintainers to request CVEs for small, academic, or personal projects as stated in [our bug bounty rules](https://hackerone.com/github-security-lab):  Please note that projects which purposely include a vulnerability pattern for testing purposes, projects that are inactive in the last year, and student or academic projects, are considered out of scope.  And therefore, we will not take into account the CVEs assigned to projects matching those conditions.  We are and will be listening to your concerns and suggestions to improve the program and avoid future similar situations.  Thank you. |

| Not wanting to argue with anyone or cause any problems, but I think it is worth adding a couple of points to what has already been said here, a little further up the thread. I appreciate both sides have valid arguments here, but there are a couple of things I disagree with.  The CVE record list is not a text book you read page by page or record by record. The CVE project aims to catalog every cybersecurity vulnerability there is.  The main problem with this mindset is that if you want to document every single security vulnerability there is, you are going to end up with hundreds of thousands of vaguely labelled CVEs from projects made by students who have use-after-free vulnerabilities in their coursework for University. You are going to have vulnerabilities in random proofs of concept for tests. You are going to have CVEs for dummy hello world applications where people hardcode a fake password or dont sanitise a SQL input, or don't encode a URL path safely. All things that in a deployed system would be critical, but in a proof of concept or test, do not actually have any significance.  From this, a situation will arise where we are going to have so much noise and so many CVEs with vague CPEs that it will make the database completely unusable in enterprise and open source scenarios. This limits the use of any of these reports where this database is used for continuous integration and vulnerability detection to prevent human error.  This will just discourage the use of the NVE database entirely. The end result will be a far less secure cyberspace.  The purpose of a CVE is to evaluate the impact of a vulnerability (hence the 10 point rating system). A vulnerability that impacts, say, React Native, is going to naturally have a wider imapct than a hello world application that exists for purely symbolic purposes. With additional noise and misclassifications, it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately determine that impact. In the same way that it is far harder to hear someone talk if everyone in the room is shouting.  If your tool can't figure out the difference between libs like jakarta-annotation-api, JUnit 5 and Fan\_Platform  I think you have misunderstood the issue here a little. The issue is that it is somewhat difficult to determine what the library is when the CPE marks the name as `*`. Even for myself, it is not clear what that CVE is actually for. I still don't fully understand what library it is targeting. Even with the word `project` in it, it does not provide any meaningful information. Those CPEs are meant to be machine readable, which is why many sites print them as monospace.  I appreciate it is not your fault this was misconfigured, but it is worth taking into appreciation when considering how the thread has blown up.  Also worth noting some of the listed projects have had zero activity since 2015, so raising a CVE is going to have little effect on amending that code base. At least one of those I clicked on does not even exist.  Scope is the main issue here. I think that is where the issues have arisen from. |

| I will be asking NIST to re-evaluate the following CVEs based on the justification below. There were some CVEs that were legit and should have been requested, but most weren't. These CVEs should absolutely not have been requested (or even approved) as there are no impacted products. We trip up on enough false-positives on valid CVEs.

| Here's what MITRE has to say about all of this  ``` Thank you for contacting us. We are primarily concerned with the amount of time required to debate CVE Records for products that are not widely used. Regardless of whether something is a "valid vulnerability in a valid Github repo" it is possible that nobody will ever use the affected code. We cannot devote a lot of time to the optimal resolution of debates about software that has very few users and/or would be difficult to incorporate into other projects.  CVE Records need to be about software products, not solely about Github repos. By far, the most common case is that one repo is used for one software product. However, as you can see,     https://github.com/RipudamanKaushikDal/projects  is about many unrelated software-development efforts by the same person. The information in your original CVE ID request pointed only to https://github.com/github/securitylab/issues/669 and did not point to the https://github.com/RipudamanKaushikDal/projects/issues/21 issue that said the vulnerability was in something called image_search_gallery. This makes the CVE ID request and the CVE Record completely invalid, and it is removed from the main CVE List. We do keep it in our GitHub repo forever:    https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/blob/c791c48acd4ec8c16b331cc745e98f3118d21568/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31569.json  in case someone needs it. However, https://github.com/RipudamanKaushikDal/projects seems to be about copying code to GitHub for personal learning without any intention to make the code usable by other people.  If you need a CVE ID for image_search_gallery, we can provide one, but we do not encourage CVE ID requests for GitHub code that has such marginal use cases.  Fan_Platform is a completely different case. Indeed, earlier today someone wanted it removed, but we did not remove it, Instead we told them that their objections were not sufficient. We looked at it and decided:    1. There might be a bug in   https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck that causes Fan_platform   to match ^pkg:maven/org\.junit\.platform/junit\-platform - in other   words, the presence of the "platform" substring might be enough for   DependencyCheck to guess that there is a dependency    2. There has been an assertion of "no license" in a situation where   multiple GitHub users have been contributing to the codebase. Even if   you do not know what the license is, the continuing activity by   multiple persons makes it reasonable to expect that they have arranged   among themselves to allow use of the software.  Again, because of time constraints, we will not necessarily send any responses or notifications about additional CVE Records that people want rejected. Your work is still a valid application of the CodeQL tool even if the GitHub repos aren't for widely used software, and your work can potentially improve the process by which other persons use CodeQL in the future. Thank you for your contribution.  ``` |

| I can see [CVE-2022-31569](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g7h7-rg53-h2g9 "CVE-2022-31569") has been removed. MITRE says I can seek a new CVE with the correct sub-project name but they don't encourage this. So I am not going to apply for a CVE that particular project again. As for the disputes to all other CVE's are considered. I think they are effectively addressed by the message above. Everyone visiting this thread for addressing their failed builds can take up the issue of the false positive with their respective tool maintainers.  With that said, [@jorgectf](https://github.com/jorgectf), the bounty application still remains in place. So far I have 13 projects and 2 independent forks which have addressed the vulnerability. Of these, `Microsoft/Olive` has merged the fix but is yet to issue a CVE. I received a message from them late last week that they are still working on this and would get back soon. `cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack` had merged the fix but now the repo has been deleted. I do have a clone `porcupineyhairs/MercadoEnLineaBack` which has been included in the [LGTM run](https://lgtm.com/query/3376780818285498863/) I shared earlier. As for the forks, `scaraude/Piano-LED-Visualizer` and `Nbobito/Piano-LED-Visualizer`, these are forks of `onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer` but have divereged from the original repo. They should be treated as separate projects but I haven't sought a CVE for them and I haven't included them in the LGTM run.  The impact metrics for of these vulnerabilities remains the exactly as we discussed [here](https://github.com/github/securitylab/issues/669#issuecomment-1118864993) |

| I'll appeal to NIST directly on the CVEs in question, but to address the points made  There has been an assertion of "no license" in a situation where multiple GitHub users have been contributing to the codebase. Even if you do not know what the license is, the continuing activity by multiple persons makes it reasonable to expect that they have arranged among themselves to allow use of the software.  A lack of licensing would mean a library or project is less likely to be used elsewhere. A lack of a release is even less likely, A build even more. And on top of all, if it hasn't even been published or versioned - I think it's safe to question if anything is really impacted. Do any of these CVEs have any sort of product or service behind them that is vulnerable?  There might be a bug in <https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck> that causes Fan\_platform to match ^pkg:maven/org.junit.platform/junit-platform - in other words, the presence of the "platform" substring might be enough for DependencyCheck to guess that there is a dependency'  Dependency check (and other tools) have to do this on purpose. They break up the keywords in the CPE to identify possible vulnerable dependencies. If the NIST data could be used to perfectly identify a vulnerable dependency then there wouldn't be the need to do this and all would be well. This "bug" sometimes accounts for the very problem caused by the negligent submission CVEs. Bad data in = Bad data out. You can't build good tools around bad data. Not saying the NIST data is bad, it's very good! We find legit vulnerabilities all the time, but we need to keep it that way. Submitting CVEs for random github projects does not serve that purpose. The world does not need to know about a vulnerability in [Uncle Yiba's photo\_tag project](https://github.com/uncleYiba/photo_tag) - [CVE-2022-31560](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pjv-vr3x-68m5 "CVE-2022-31560"). It takes manpower and computing power to ensure things are identified properly. It's not cheap! |

| Hi [@porcupineyhairs](https://github.com/porcupineyhairs),  Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the findings we have determined this submission is not eligible for a reward under the Bug Bounty program, because the security vulnerabilities have been disclosed publicly, in public Issues and Pull Requests.  The Bug Slayer program requires that you disclose the vulnerabilities following a **coordinated disclosure** process. Here are the extracts of our rules that mention this:  To be eligible for a bounty, you must first coordinate disclosure and fix of the vulnerabilities with the maintainers of the projects  The CVEs must correspond to vulnerabilities that have been disclosed and fixed via coordinated disclosure with the maintainers.  We know that private collaboration between security researchers and maintainers is sometimes difficult, but that is precisely the point of this program. As stated in our rules:  The goal of this program is to incentivize the collaboration with maintainers to fix vulnerabilities.  Even though this submission was assessed as being ineligible for the bounty program, we appreciate your efforts finding and fixing security vulnerabilities at scale in open source projects, and would like to offer you a thank you reward.  Best regards and happy hacking! |

| Okay, so `@xcorail` and I discussed this on Slack the other day. I am posting a brief below to keep track of the conversation. Here's what I understand so far.  GHSL wants to promote responsible behaviour and hence requests that a researcher only make a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure(CVD). In this case, GHSL deems that by making a public issue and a public PR with a fix, I have violated CVD norms. Instead of filing public issues and public PR's, I should have contacted each maintainer individually and requested them to either fix the vulnerability, provide them a private patch or at least seek prior permission before submitting the PR.  In my defense, I have referenced the [CERT's Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf) which defnes Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) as a process for reducing adversary advantage while an information security vulnerability is being mitigated. It says there are six phases of a disclosure, Discovery, Reporting, Validation and Triage, Remediation, Public Awareness and Deployment. It explicitly says that a stakeholder may be responsible for more than one phase. In this case, since everthing till the Remediation phase was handled by me. I discovered the underlying issue, validated the vulnerability, drafted a report and even created a patch; I claim that there is no real adversary advantage resulting from my acts. None of the projects were, even for a few minutes, left without a patch.  I claim, since the vendor for open source projects is typically the owner of the repo and the repository's contributors, by the virtue of me submitting a tested patch, I, for the purposes of CVD, can act as a vendor. `@xcorail` does not agree with this. They say, the vendor should only be the owner or a previous contributor. I can't deem myself as a vendor and publish a patch.  I would also like to point out that my CodeQL patch was merged directly into an already existing stable query. So the vulnerabilities were already publicly visible on LGTM. In fact, walking through the LGTM alerts for the particular rule is what led me to those projects in the first place. While I claim above that I carried out the reporting phase, it was infact LGTM which did it. The vulnerability was publicly shown on LGTM well before I attempted to patch them. My public Github issues/PRs don't make any new additions on that front. My PRs on the contrary aid in fixing them. I might have made the public disclosure which prompted the maintainers to act but I am not the first one to discuss the vulnerability publicly. LGTM did that before me by making alerts publicly visible.  By this decision, I believe GHSL is implying that no new alert on LGTM, resulting from a CodeQL stable query, or any additional patch on it, would ever be eligible for Bug Slayer. Is this intended? |

[@xcorail](https://github.com/xcorail) does not agree with this. They say, the vendor should only be the owner or a previous contributor. I can't deem myself as a vendor and publish a patch.  Indeed I do not agree with you. The reporter cannot be a vendor. If you look at page 17 of the CERT guide that you mention, the vendor is clearly defined, and when they talk about open source they say `Many open source libraries are maintained by a single person or a small independent team; we still refer to these individuals and groups as vendors` which implies that in the open source case, the vendor is a maintainer or a group of maintainers of the projects (and not all contributors). You can totally publish a patch if you want, but you cannot consider yourself as a `vendor` in the documented CVD. The CVD is a **collaboration** between the reporter and the vendor, so the reporter cannot be the vendor.  By this decision, I believe GHSL is implying that no new alert on LGTM, resulting from a CodeQL stable query, or any additional patch on it, would ever be eligible for Bug Slayer.  The LGTM alerts are indeed visible to the public, but they are not yet verified and triaged. If you use one of these alerts, verify it, create a PoC for it, propose a patch or not, **disclose it privately following the CVD**, and get the consent of the maintainer to create a public PR, then that would be eligible to our program. |

| I'll just chime in here too.. b/c you are doing things so wrong.  I discovered the underlying issue, validated the vulnerability, drafted a report and even created a patch  I don't see how you could have done this. Most of those "projects" don't have a viable application that you could have gotten up and running. Have you done a reproduction or exploited any of these "applications" that you have alerted the public about? Just b/c something shows in a SAST scan doesn't mean it's vulnerable. It's got to be explotible in the context of a running application.  I claim, since the vendor for open source projects is typically the owner of the repo and the repository's contributors, by the virtue of me submitting a tested patch.  Yeah.. that's BS! You couldn't have "tested" the patch on a running "application" there are no applications to run on those CVEs you've opened. Maybe you've tested the remediation by itself, but you have not in the context of those projects. It's just scraps of code in various repositories.  IMO - Mitre has handled this wrong too. Lots of wrong everywhere. |

| [@xcorail](https://github.com/xcorail)  The LGTM alerts are indeed visible to the public, but they are not yet verified and triaged. If you use one of these alerts, verify it, create a PoC for it, propose a patch or not,  CVD says verification and triage is done by the vendor. Provided that the vendor can reproduce the issue by reading the report, PoC, patch etc are not required by CVD. In this case, qhelp would typically suffice.  disclose it privately following the CVD, and get the consent of the maintainer to create a public PR, then that would be eligible to our program.  The disclosure is already done. A report's a report regardless of who does it. A report even from a less trusted source is still processed the same way. Yes, during verification/triage the vendor may still decline it but I don't see any special exclusions for anyone there. I am trying to understand how a report from LGTM differs from a report by me on this front. |

| Just want to add my last 2¢ on this issue...  In this case, GHSL deems that by making a public issue and a public PR with a fix, I have violated CVD norms. Instead of filing public issues and public PR's, I should have contacted each maintainer individually and requested them to either fix the vulnerability, provide them a private patch or at least seek prior permission before submitting the PR.  Isn't this the whole definition of responsible disclosure? You don't make dangerous information known to the world until actions have been taken to prevent it being exploited by falling into the wrong hands. By making an issue the center of attention by raising public paperwork for it, you are just holding up a big flashing sign saying "hey, I found an exploit for your application that is dangerous, come see".  If the exploit isn't dangerous or has very limited or no scope, it then questions the appropriateness of a CVE.  The vulnerability was publicly shown on LGTM well before I attempted to patch them.  LGTM just shows the potential for a vulnerability to be present. It does not understand every edge case that exists to prove something is exploitable. LGTM is an advisory assistive tool, not a single source of truth.  LGTM is also an automated tool, it lacks the ability to exercise situational discretion in the same way you do as a human. This is important to distinguish.  I have seen applications that LGTM would raise as being vulnerable to CVEs that are just totally incorrect (one being Log4Shell), purely because a dependency has an optional binding to that library. The noise by false positives is always a deterrent for people looking for quick ways to exploit deployed software. LGTM can also be left misconfigured for some projects, which can add additional noise that an attacker would have to spend time and resources working around.  By raising issues and PRs before a fix has been evaluated and ideally implemented, you are effectively reducing the legwork needed by people scraping for exploits. Unlike LGTM, you are saying "I have proven that this is vulnerable", not just "this has the potential to be vulnerable based on other cases I know of".  For most Flask apps that are just hobby/pet projects, the impact is somewhat limited, but imagine if you did this for heartbleed, or spectre-like attacks. It would throw everyone into an immediate panic. |

| [@ascopes](https://github.com/ascopes)  By making an issue the center of attention by raising public paperwork for it, you are just holding up a big flashing sign saying "hey, I found an exploit for your application that is dangerous, come see".  LGTM rule results are already public. I sent in a public patch to fix bugs which were valid after manual testing. If you are someone looking at Github issues for vulnerabilities, you are definitely looking at LGTM and the likes for reports too.  LGTM just shows the potential for a vulnerability to be present. It does not understand every edge case that exists to prove something is exploitable. LGTM is an advisory assistive tool, not a single source of truth.  In the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, each report is to be assesed independently. The sources may be less trusted but that does not mean you disregard the report.  I have seen applications that LGTM would raise as being vulnerable to CVEs that are just totally incorrect (one being Log4Shell), purely because a dependency has an optional binding to that library. The noise by false positives is always a deterrent for people looking for quick ways to exploit deployed software.  Agreed.  By raising issues and PRs before a fix has been evaluated and ideally implemented, you are effectively reducing the legwork needed by people scraping for exploits. Unlike LGTM, you are saying "I have proven that this is vulnerable", not just "this has the potential to be vulnerable based on other cases I know of".  The fix are comparitively minor and all assessed manually by me. A report for "has the potential to be vulnerable" is still a report worth taking a look at according to CERT's CVD guidelines. Yes, one could have looked at my profile and found a very useful set of results but I don't know if there would be a meaningful impact in this case.  Basically, I am seeking a few clarifications on GHSL's bounty program. GHSL is rejecting my report saying I am making a public disclosure instead of a CVD. But the thing is if you strictly go by the CVD guidelines, then even LGTM alerts are treated as valid reports. If GHSL is disqualifying my report due to non-conformance with CVD guidelines, I would like to know if GHSL plans on disqualifing all cases where a public LGTM alert was shown as ineligible on similar grounds. |

| In the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process  This is kind of missing my point. My point is not that it follows some defined process. My point is that it is a difference between speculation and confirmation.  I sent in a public patch to fix bugs which were valid after manual testing.  That's the point, you explicitly declared and confirmed the vulnerability. Without doing that, it is not clear that the issue was actually a problem in the first place.  Also, by you doing this on your account, you are effectively providing a directory of confirmed exploits to anyone who wishes to misuse that information. As I said, LGTM does not confirm issues. It only flags the potential that they might exist. Any software could be potentially vulnerable but that can be implied by just seeing the dependency list most of the time. LGTM is just linking that and the patterns for it. Neither are disclosing a confirmed issue.  It is a case of providing additional information that was not there before, either via clarity, reproductions, confirmation, or additional attack vectors.  Not speaking on behalf of the project, but that is my assumption as to why this is the case. |

But the thing is if you strictly go by the CVD guidelines, then even LGTM alerts are treated as valid reports.  I don't agree. LGTM alerts are not `valid reports`. They are just results of a SAST tool, without any human additional analysis of whether the alert is exploitable or not.  If GHSL is disqualifying my report due to non-conformance with CVD guidelines, I would like to know if GHSL plans on disqualifing all cases where a public LGTM alert was shown as ineligible on similar grounds.  I already answered this question above. If you transform one of these alerts into an actionable report, by adding your added value as a security researcher (examples from what [@ascopes](https://github.com/ascopes) said: `either via clarity, reproductions, confirmation`), and disclose it privately to the maintainer, then it would be eligible. |

`[# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of](/NickHastings/ganga/commit/8157aaec621e963abca325cadcfa7a3f112eb344 "# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call (#2025)

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. This attack is also known as “dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and “backtracking”.

## Common Weakness Enumeration category
CWE - 36

## Root Cause Analysis

The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path.  Please see the example below.
```
>>> import os.path
>>> static = \"path/to/mySafeStaticDir\"
>>> malicious = \"/../../../../../etc/passwd\"
>>> os.path.join(t,malicious)
'/../../../../../etc/passwd'
```
Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks.

In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :
https://github.com/ganga-devs/ganga/blob/0c0f9e33b36ee7ead0855f1464f8d4efad26bdbc/ganga/GangaGUI/gui/routes.py#L671

Here, the `path` parameter is attacker controlled. This parameter passes through the unsafe `os.path.join` call making the effective directory and filename passed to the `send_file` call attacker controlled. This leads to a path traversal attack.

## Proof of Concept

The bug can be verified using a proof of concept similar to the one shown below.

```
curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/job/<int:job_id>/browse///../../../../etc/passwd\"'
```
## Remediation

This can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `werkzeug.utils.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System Vector

The attack can be carried over the network. A complex non-standard configuration or a specialized condition is not required for the attack to be successfully conducted. There is no user interaction required for successful execution. The attack can affect components outside the scope of the target module. The attack can be used to gain access to confidential files like passwords, login credentials and other secrets. It cannot be directly used to affect a change on a system resource. Hence has limited to no impact on integrity. Using this attack vector a attacker may make multiple requests for accessing huge files such as a database. This can lead to a partial system denial service. However, the impact on availability is quite low in this case. Taking this account an appropriate CVSS v3.1 vector would be

This gives it a base score of 9.3/10 and a severity rating of critical.

Since the "malicious" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks.

In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :
<https://github.com/HolgerGraef/MSM/blob/6dd2c9557e0285e1270c84375ebd6f8d10e422a4/app/main/views.py#L544>

Here, the `path` parameter is attacker controlled. This parameter passes through the unsafe `os.path.join` call making the effective directory and filename passed to the `send_file` call attacker controlled. This leads to a path traversal attack.

The bug can be verified using a proof of concept similar to the one shown below.

```
curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/plugins//../../../../etc/passwd"'
```

This can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.

# Equanimity

Equanimity is a world building game with a heavy emphasis on squad-based turn-based combat and balance.

## Installation

First, create a virtualenv, clone the repository into the env, cd into repo.

Then, install dependencies:

> $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, make directories:

> $ mkdir logs

> $ mkdir -p DBs/World

Start ZODB instance:

> $ runzeo -C zeo/zeoWorld.conf &

Next, create world:

> $ tools/init.\_db.py

Run wsgi server:

> $ ./run\_wsgi\_server.sh

Finally, run demo:

> $ tools/demo.py --url=<http://127.0.0.1:8080>

##Running tests
From inside virtualenv

> $ ./setup.py test [--nose-only] [--run-failed]

Coverage statements should print to the terminal when running the tests.
--nose-only indicates to run only the nose test runner, and not the pep8 and pyflakes checkers
--run-failed passes this option to nose, which will only re-run failed tests

# Data Stream Algorithm Benchmark

A benchmark intended for testing the performance of various data stream algorithms for multiple datasets in a simple way.

## Requirements

* Both python2(>=2.7) and python3(>=3.5) are required.
* For python2, matplotlib and future packages are needed:
  + `pip2 install matplotlib==2 future`
* [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

## How to build

First, you need to clone this repo, and install the python3 dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/Yuol96/pku-sketch-benchmark
cd pku-sketch-benchmark
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the default datasets.

```
sh download.sh
```

## How to start

For the first time, you need to run `env.sh` to set up some environmental variables. Then, initiate the database.

```
source env.sh
flask init-db
```

To start the system, run the following command:

```
sh run.sh
```

Now, you can type in `<your-ip-address>:8086/skbm/index.html` in your web browser to access the benchmark interface.

## How to use

To make it more convenient and easier to use, we have built up a website for datastreams algorithms benchmarking. When you visit the home page, there are several modules to configure before running experiments and drawing graphs.

#### Select datasets

The first module is the dataset module. You need to choose one or more network datasets, and the selected datasets would be fed to each experiments of different parameter settings respectively. When you hover over a dataset button, the info about this dataset would pop out. Once you clicked the dataset, the corresponding button would turn to grey.

[![img](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/raw/master/imgs/dataset.png)](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/blob/master/imgs/dataset.png)

#### Generate new datasets

Though there are some existing datasets available, you can click the button at the bottom of this module to generate your own dataset. In the dataset generating page, you need to choose a distribution and fill out the form and submit the request to generate a dataset. Once you have done, you can go back to the home page and the generated dataset should be shown in the first module.

[![img](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/raw/master/imgs/addDataset.png)](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/blob/master/imgs/addDataset.png)

#### Experiments setup

The main function of the benchmark lies in the second module, where you can perform grid search experiments over multiple parameters. Here we assume an experiment is defined by a particular sketch combined with a specific task. Within each experiment setup, you should first choose a sketch and a task, and then the corresponding parameters would have shown below. Each row defines a value range of a parameter. If you only need a single value for a parameter, you can only fill out the “from” box and leave the other two alone. If you want to perform multiple experiments, click the button at the bottom of this module.

[![img](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/raw/master/imgs/experiment.png)](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/blob/master/imgs/experiment.png)

#### Add new sketch algorithms

To test your own sketch algorithm, you can upload your own sketch code by clicking the last item of the sketch dropdown button. When redirecting to the new page and uploading your code, you need to provide the name of your sketch algorithm. It is recommended to use "xxxSketch" pattern. The name should be different from all the existing sketch algorithms in this benchmark, or the original sketch with the same name would be overwriten. Then, specify all the hyperparameters that should be defined before experimenting your algorithms. Finally, copy and paste your code in the code box and submit and compile your code. Notice that you may fail to compile the code. When this happens, your code won't be recorded and you need to check your code. Sometimes you want to change your algorithm after having submission and compilation. By simply submitting your updated code with the same sketch name can overwrite the original version of code. When you finished, click the navigation icon at the top of the page to go back to the main page.

#### Run the experiments

After configuring the first two modules, click `ready to go` to start running experiments at the back ends. This may take some time, depending on your configuration.

[![img](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/raw/master/imgs/readyToGo.png)](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/blob/master/imgs/readyToGo.png)

#### The Graph module

The experimental results will send back to the front end, and the user can visualize the results by using **Graph** module. This module requires specific configuration for each point. Y axis in the second module is the same as the first module. X label is the name of x axis in the graph. For each point, you need to specify which line it belongs to, the position of the point in the x axis, and the index of the experiment that you want to draw value from. All the experiemnts are shown below the search box, and you can search particular experiment by typing keywords.

[![img](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/raw/master/imgs/graph.png)](/DSABenchmark/DSAB/blob/master/imgs/graph.png)

#### Sample result

When you finish configuring the graph module, click the `draw` button, and the figure would be generated in the backend. You can click `Get the Graph!` to see the figure, or you can also share the link with others.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# 📖 ThunderDocs

## Intro

A grande maioria dos projetos da computação da equipe são documentados seguindo a convenção [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/), que se auto intitula

> The *de facto* standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources

Uma das principais funcionalidades do Doxygen é gerar arquivos de documentação no formato HTML, que permite o acesso online dos documentos gerados. Nós poderíamos facilmente utilizar uma [action do github](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/doxygen-action) pra gerar a documentação automaticamente e acessar pelo [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), aproveitando a hospedagem do próprio GitHub. No entanto, o próprio GitHub exibe a mensagem de alerta

> Caution: This repository is private but the published site will be public.

As páginas do GitHub pages são abertas para todos e não é interessante que qualquer pessoa tenha acesso a esses arquivos. A documentação de um projeto é mais importante do que o próprio código-fonte (melhor do que conseguir o bolo é conseguir a receita do bolo)

Pensando nesse problema, criamos um conjunto de configurações para um servidor [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) com autenticação pelo Google, de modo que qualquer pessoa com email @thunderatz.org é capaz de acessar a página. A autenticação é feita por meio de um app [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (framework python) que faz a requisição para o site do Google e faz o gerenciamento da sessão do usuário.

## Estrutura dos projetos

Para o carregamento automático da documentação de um projeto, é necessário que:

* O projeto possua um Doxyfile na raiz
* A criação de arquivos html esteja habilitada no Doxyfile
* A documentação seja gerada na pasta docs/Doxygen
* O projeto seja adicionado no arquivo projects.json

### Sintaxe do json

* name - Nome do projeto, que será mostrado na página principal
* slug - Nome somente com letras minúsculas, utilizado nas pastas e caminhos
* git - Endereço do repositório do projeto
* branch - Branch cuja documentação será mostrada

## Estrutura das requisições

[![requests](/ThundeRatz/ThunderDocs/raw/master/docs/requests.png)](/ThundeRatz/ThunderDocs/blob/master/docs/requests.png)

1. Um cliente faz uma requisição para o algum endereço dentro do docs.thudneratz.org
2. O servidor nginx repassa a requisição para a aplicação python
3. Caso o cliente ainda não tenha se autenticado, o usuário é levado à página /login para autenticação com a conta do Google
4. Caso os dados sejam válidos, o servidor do Google responde com um token de acesso
5. Se a autenticação foi bem sucedida, o python puxa os arquivos na pasta requisitada
6. O arquivo .html correspondente é carregado
7. O arquivo é então enviado ao nginx
   1. Caso o cliente não tenha se autenticado corretamente, o cliente é redirecionado novamente para a página de login
8. O cliente recebe o arquivo requisitado

Para saber mais sobre autenticação OAuth com nginx, veja [esse link](https://www.nginx.com/blog/validating-oauth-2-0-access-tokens-nginx/) e [essa pergunta](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55719659/using-flask-login-to-authenticate-nginx-reverse-proxy) no StackOverflow e [essa](https://www.ruby-forum.com/t/is-there-setting-equivalent-to-proxy-set-header-for-uwsgi/210778) no ruby-forum pra saber como redirecionar requisições de autenticação para o Flask.

## Configurações

Para fazer o deploy da aplicação Flask, é necessário configurar o [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), que será o programa que irá fazer a interface web com o python. Recomendo [esse tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04-pt) da DigitalOcean.

### Primeiro deploy

O arquivo trdocs.service deve ser copiado para a pasta /etc/systemd/system/

```
sudo cp ./config/trdocs.service /etc/systemd/system/trdocs.service
```

Para iniciar o serviço, digite

```
sudo systemctl start trdocs
sudo systemctl enable trdocs
```

Para fazer a configuração dos certificados de https, utilizamos o [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Para o novo domínio, precisamos gerar novos certificados. Recomendo seguir o tutorial oficial, que é bem completo e explicado

## Desenvolvimento local

Para desenvolvimento local, é necessário que o servidor local tenha suporte a https. Para fazer essa configuração, recomendo [esse tutorial](https://adrianorosa.com/blog/nginx/configurar-nginx-https-server-com-self-signed-ssl-certificado.html). Vou deixar como referência também [esse guia](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/running-your-flask-application-over-https) com o passo a passo desde o desenvolvimento local até o deploy

## ToDo

* Automatizar atualização da documentação quando so projetos recebem novos commits
* Templates html mais bonitos

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

OPDS 标准核心功能是支持 EPUB 标准和基于 Atom XML 的目录格式. 可以使用阅读器进行在线书库添加，比如FBReader、静读天下（Moon+ Reader）、Aldiko、Stanza等等

##cockybook简介
cockybook是python开发的一个opds server 的简易书籍共享服务。
使用python Flask实现。
他的数据源可以是本地存储，也可以是云存储如百度网盘、七牛云存储。当然你可以很方便的自定义实现自己的数据源接口。

##What is OPDS？
OPDS全称是Open Publication Distribution System开放式出版发布系统，使用 Atom 格式，意在为电子书在线目录建立一个公开标准。OPDS 将 RSS 信息源，替换为电子书目录，包括链接到书籍封面和简短摘要的可选链接。使用 OPDS，用户无需到处点击链接，通过电子书应用程序，只需订阅并搜索这些目录，然后就可以将电子书下载到 ebook 阅读器中，不需要再使用浏览器或其他应用程序。
OPDS 标准核心功能是支持 EPUB 标准和基于 Atom XML 的目录格式。

##OPDS协议

可以参考博客：<http://www.cockybook.com/?p=159>

##入口
`opdsserver.py`
可以直接启动`opdsserver.py`
这里你可以找到:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                format='%(asctime)s %(filename)s[line:%(lineno)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s',
                )
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')

```

##程序结构
文件系统接口，你好可以自由扩展。
`opdscore.py` 中主要类：
这个类描述需要实现的主要接口。

```
class OpdsProtocol:
    def listBooks(self, path):
        return ("No Realized")
        pass
    def dowloadBook(self, path):
        return ("No Realized")
        pass
    def showhtml(self):
        return ("No Realized")
        pass

```

`filesystem.py`
你可以在这个类中实现你的数据源文件操作。
目前实现的有LocalFileSystem、QiniuFileSystem。

```
class LocalMetadataFileSystem(FileSystem):
class QiniuFileSystem(FileSystem):

```

##部署

1. 目前可以在[sinaapp](http://sinaapp.com/)中直接部署。index.wsgi 已经写好。
2. 可以直接运行`opdsserver.py`进行发布。

---

### system

所有前端的檔案都放在`/app/`
下面的相對位置都是以/app為根目錄標示的

* flask template: `template/`
* flask statistic file `statistic/`

# /template/index.html

最小單位的區塊長這樣
其中`col-lg-12`代表在大螢幕裝置上這個區塊的寬度就是12個單位, 以glance來說就是單欄顯示
最裡面的div就是裝每個module的地方, 可以用底下的`loadTemplate`把資料裝進去

```
    <div class="row marketing plot-module">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <div id="wordDefinition">

            </div>

        </div>
    </div>
```

# /scripts/main.js

所有的js檔都先放在這裡面

## Functions

### fetchData( qWord )

user輸入一個字之後, 會啟動這隻function
所以只要把你寫好的function在這隻call就好了

### loadTemplate( templateName, data, entry )

這個檔案會讀取template檔(語法是用鬍子先生mustache, 底層是handlebar), 然後把render好的html檔讀到entry裡面

**template path**

記得要把template擺在

```
/hb-tempate/<template name>

```

並且副檔名是`.tpl`
templateName這個參數就是傳`.tpl`之前的檔案名稱(不包括副檔名)

鬍子先生的語法可以參考

[handlebar.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# testplatform

针对app的测试平台

环境依赖：

```
1、python3.5 +

2、appium 1_4_13 +

```

环境准备：

```
1、安装依赖的库：cmd窗口下进入项目目录，执行：pip install -r requirements.txt

2、等库安装完成后，继续执行命令: python manager.py dbinit   如果输出了 "ok" ，说明环境已经ok

3、运行目录下的start.bat

4、打开浏览器访问 http://localhost:5000

```

使用建议：

```
1、先在【设备管理】内添加你的手机信息，设备序号就是deviceName

2、如果想要跑appium，需要先写测试用例，【用例管理-写测试用例】，api的用法请点击[查看API]按钮；如果想跑monkey性能测试，可以直接去【任务管理-新建任务】(monkey默认跑10000个动作,有点耗时，如果想少跑一点可以改config.py里的monkey_action_count配置项)

3、有关写测试用例，可以在【用例管理-写测试用例】页点击[打开模拟器],会新开一个mirror的页面，这个是用来在线操作手机，获取元素，保存元素的

    3.1、 mirror用法（1、手机连接到电脑  2、点击页面左上角上传需要测试的app  3、点击[安装并启动app] 之后的操作亲们自己试吧）

    3.2、 建议电脑连接两台手机，一台手机边用mirror保存元素，写用例，另一台手机去跑写好的测试用例

```

备注：

```
1、mirror只在我自己的手机(分辨率为1080*1920)上测试通过，如果发现不好使，可以换个手机试试

2、由于adb本身不稳定，多次插拔手机会使adb命令出错，导致获取不到手机的连接状态，亲们可以手动重启adb，方式：cmd窗口下执行 adb kill-server  |  adb devices

```

有关持续集成：

```
平台支持与jenkins集成，通过目录下的 jenkins_ci.py  【前提是jenkins部署的机器和本机网络互通】

1、新建一个jenkins的job，添加Execute Windows batch command,填写如下内容：

    cd $path_to_testplatform

    python jenkins_ci.py $path_to_your_apk all %BUILD_NUMBER% 5000

    说明：$path_to_testplatform 是本地测试平台的存放目录  $path_to_your_apk 是本机待测试apk存放的绝对路径 其他的不需要修改

2、保存，点击立即构建，此时jenkins会向测试平台发送创建测试任务的请求，在测试平台内会自动新建一个测试任务，默认选择连接正常的手机，以及平台内所有用例设置为通过了的用例进行测试（这就是为什么平台内[所有用例]模块有[设置通过]和[取消通过]按钮，为持续集成设计的）

```

Doing:

```
1、不启动appium获取控件，静态解析app控件树

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Personal Recipe Database

There are a lot of recipes on the internet. Unfortunately, most of them are bad. I currently store a bunch of recipes in catgorized folders. Probem is that many dishes fit multiple categories. For example: falafel can both be snack food and a meal. The plan here is to have a project that stores pdfs and uses mongo to tag the metadata. then I can use a get request to perform queries and find recipes that fit a specific tag.

## To Run

1. Checkout this directory to a specified location
2. Setup a Mongo instance. I made mine using <https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/mongo/> . You'll need to create a recipes collection and point the url at the correct IP
3. Install packages denoted in requirements.txt
4. Run flask and start inserting some recipes.

Note: This is more of a hobby project to improve my skills as a developer than a fully fleged project with continued development. That being said, feel free to ask me any questions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Sphere- Image Backend

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Linux, Windows or Mac OSX
* The source code this library
* Docker & docker-compose

## Start API

* We recommend using the `docker-compose` command for running an instance of this API.

  To start an instance of this API using the following command to run it in docker:

  `docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans`

  If you would like to run it background, use:

  `docker-compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
* If you do not wish to run it in docker (why?), please do the following

  ```
    virtualenv -p python3 flask
    source flask/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 imageapi.py

  ```

  You also need to change the server address for MongoDB, redis, and MySQL in utils.py, api.py and utils.py respectively to the address where these instances are hosted.

  In addition to this, you will need to run redis-server in a new terminal window using: `redis-server`

  And run a celery worker to perform background tasks using:

  ```
    virtualenv -p python3 flask
    source flask/bin/activate
    celery worker -A imageapi.celery -l info

  ```

(See, it is easier with docker-compose)

You can then send requests to `http://localhost/sphere/api/v1/...`

See imageapi.py for more details on endpoints

# Flask-Yeoman

A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) blueprint to make create web application using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and Flask an easy task.

## Features

* Automatically inject Flask config in index.html
* Support for development and production mode

## Installation

```
$ pip install flask-yeoman
```

## Getting Started

Create a server.py file in at the root of your yeoman app:

```
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_yeoman import flask_yeoman

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(flask_yeoman)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

You can start working on your app as usual, and since it automatically injects Flask `config`` allowing you to easily share configuration between Flask and your Backbone app (using the `tojson` jinja helper):

```
<script>
window.myapp.config = {myvar: {{ config.MYVAR|tojson }},
                       myvar2: {{ config.MYVAR2|tojson }}};
</script>
```

### Grunt configuration

In order to use your own server with Yeoman, you must create a new task in your Gruntfile.js file:

```
// New task for flask server
grunt.registerTask('flask', 'Run flask server.', function() {
   var spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
   grunt.log.writeln('Starting Flask development server.');
   // stdio: 'inherit' let us see flask output in grunt
   process.env.FLASK_YEOMAN_DEBUG = 1;
   var PIPE = {stdio: 'inherit'};
   spawn('python', ['server.py'], PIPE);
});
```

And replace the `connect:reload` task by `flask` in the server task:

```
grunt.registerTask('server', function (target) {
    if (target === 'dist') {
        return grunt.task.run(['build', 'open', 'connect:dist:keepalive']);
    } else if (target === 'test') {
        return grunt.task.run([
            'clean:server',

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Sleep Learner

There are videos on youtube of a voice saying a word and its definition for hours, so you play it while you sleep.

* Example (English): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9g7ZJFtQms>
* Example (Japanese): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJSPE0jNJpI>

The problem with this is you’re going to know a lot of the words. Wouldn’t it be more useful if it generated a mp3 personalized for you, based on words you find difficult? In this hackathon project, we quiz the user to find out what words he doesn’t know, then use a speech library to play the words and definitions as he falls asleep.

## Installation

1. virtualenv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. sudo npm install -g bower
5. bower install
6. npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-react
7. sh init\_db.sh
8. mkdir -p /data/sleep-learner

## Running

1. python project/app.py
2. Go to localhost:5000

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Sphere

Sphere is a Python library that implements a Brain Command Interface system.
[Full documentation](https://spheredocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter it:

   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:noamezekiel/sphere.git
   ...
   $ cd sphere/
   ```
2. Run the installation script and activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   $ ./scripts/install.sh
   ...
   $ source .env/bin/activate
   [sphere] $ # now you can start the fun!
   ```

We assume that docker is already installed and that it's version is > 19.03.9

## Usage

Our library consists the followings parts: client, server, parsers, saver, api, cli and gui.

### client

The client read the sample and upload it to the server.
It is available as **sphere.client** and expose the following API:

```
>>> from sphere.client import upload_sample
>>> upload_sample(path='sample.mind.gz', host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, file_format='protobuf')
... # upload path to the server at host:port
```

And With the command-line interface:

```
$ python -m sphere.client upload_sample  \
      -h/--host '127.0.0.1'             \
      -p/--port 8000                    \
      -f/--file-format 'protobuf'
      'sample.mind.gz'
... # upload 'snapshot.mind.gz' to the server at host:port
```

### server

The server accept connections from clients receive the uploaded samples and publish them to its message queue.

It is available as **sphere.server** and expose the following API:

```
>>> from sphere.server import run_server
>>> def print_message(message):
...     print(message)
>>> run_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, publish=print_message)
... # listen on host:port and pass received messages to publish
```

And with the command-line interface:

```
$ python -m sphere.server run-server \
      -h/--host '127.0.0.1'          \
      -p/--port 8000                 \
      'rabbitmq://127.0.0.1:5672/' # format of the url: <db_server>://<host>:<port>/
... # listen on host:port and pass received messages to message queue
```

Please note that in python you can pass any publishing function, but in the cli you can only pass a URL to a message queue.

### parsers

The parsers consume raw data of a snapshot and return the parsed data.

It is available as **sphere.parsers** and expose the following API:

For running the parser on a specific data-

```
>>> from sphere.parsers import run_parser
>>> data = …
>>> result = run_parser('pose', data)
```

Which accepts a parser name and some raw data.

With the command-line interface:

```
$ python -m sphere.parsers parse 'pose' 'snapshot.raw' > 'pose.result'
```

Which accepts a parser name and a path to some raw data.

For running the parser as a service-

```
$ python -m sphere.parsers run-parser 'pose' 'rabbitmq://127.0.0.1:5672/'
```

Which accepts a parser name and a url.
The format of the url is: *mq\_server://host:port/*

### saver

The saver consumes from the message queue and saves the data to the database

It is available as **sphere.saver** and expose the following API:

```
>>> from sphere.saver import Saver
>>> saver = Saver(database_url)
>>> data = …
>>> saver.save('pose', data)
```

Which connects to a database, accepts a topic name and some data, as consumed from the message queue, and saves it to the database.
The format of the url is: *db\_server://host:port/*

And with the command-line interface:

```
python -m sphere.saver save                     \
      -d/--database 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017' \
     'pose'                                       \
     'pose.result'
```

Which accepts a topic name and a path to some raw data, as consumed from the message queue, and saves it to a database.
The format of the url is the same as above.

For running the saver as a server:

```
$ python -m sphere.saver run-saver  \
      'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017' \
      'rabbitmq://127.0.0.1:5672/'
```

Which consumes the data from the message queue and saves it to the database.
The format of the urls is the same as before.

### api

The api serves a RESTfull API.
It is available as **sphere.api** and expose the following API:

```
>>> from sphere.api import run_api_server
>>> run_api_server(
...     host = '127.0.0.1',
...     port = 5000,
...     database_url = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017',
... )
# listen on host:port and serve data from database_url
```

And with the command-line interface:

```
$ python -m sphere.api run-server \
      -h/--host '127.0.0.1'       \
      -p/--port 5000              \
      -d/--database 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'
```

The format of the urls is the same as above.
The api server support the following RESTful API endpoints:

* **GET /users**: Returns the list of all the supported users.
* **GET /users/user-id**: Returns the specified user's details.
* **GET /users/user-id/snapshots**: Returns the list of the specified user's snapshot.
* **GET /users/user-id/snapshots/snapshot-id**: Returns the specified snapshot's details.
* **GET /users/user-id/snapshots/snapshot-id/result-name**: Returns the specified snapshot's result.
* **GET /users/user-id/snapshots/snapshot-id/color-image/data**: Data of large binary result.

### cli

The cli consume the api, and reflect it.
It is available as **sphere.cli** and expose the following cli:

```
$ python -m sphere.cli get-users
... # Returns the list of all the supported users
$ python -m sphere.cli get-user 1
... # Returns the details of user 1
$ python -m sphere.cli get-snapshots 1
... # Returns the list of snapshots of user 1
$ python -m sphere.cli get-snapshot 1 2
... # Returns details of snapshot 2 of user 1
$ python -m sphere.cli get-result 1 2 'pose'
... # Returns the result of snapshot 2 of user 1
```

All commands accept the *-h/--host* and *-p/--port* flags to configure the host and port, but default to the api's address.
The get-result command also accept the *-s/--save* flag that, if specified, receives a path, and saves the result's data to that path.

### gui

The gui run a web server that reflects the data from the database.
It is available as **sphere.gui** and expose the following API:

```
>>> from sphere.gui import run_server
>>> run_server(
...     host = '127.0.0.1',
...     port = 8080,
...     database_url = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/', # <db_server>://<host>:<port>/
... )
```

And with the command-line interface:

```
$ python -m sphere.gui run-server \
      -h/--host '127.0.0.1'       \
      -p/--port 8080              \
      -d/--database 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'
```

## Deployment

For running the server, message queue, parsers, saver, database, api and gui in docker containers, run the **run-pipeline.sh** script:

```
$ ./scripts/run-pipeline.sh
... Setting up the pipeline, this may take a few seconds
...
$ # now upload samples and consume the api and gui
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

可以对百度文库的文档转换为pdf格式进行下载

**[博客地址](https://www.upstudy.top/index.php/archives/21/)**

## 如何使用？

#### 一、下载项目zip包，或者直接用git获取

**$ git clone <https://github.com/ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb>**

#### 二、安装依赖

项目使用的依赖有

1. requests
2. chardet
3. bs4
4. Pillow
5. pdfkit
6. flask
7. imgkit
8. img2pdf

cd到项目文件夹中使用命令，直接一键安装
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Automated Quiz Evaluation System

## Team Members:

* Zubair Abid
* Sravani Boinepelli
* Sriven Reddy Nookala
* C.Sai Sukrutha
* Praffullitt Jain
* Kripa Anne Tharakan

## Problem Statement:

Given handwritten subjective answers, the system automates the process of correction by digitising handwritten text into a digital format for easier understanding, and to speed up answer evaluation via machine learning, as far as current systems allow.

There would be two types of users: students and instructors. Instructors submit question-answer pairs (in plaintext). Students submit scans of their handwritten solutions. This solution will be fed through the system for automated processing and evaluation. To enable ease of horizontal scaling, each module shall be a containerised application with clearly defined input and output, so new containers can be fired up to handle greater load as required.

# Fishtank

Fishtank is a remote monitoring and control interface for my fishtank. The server is put together using the python flask framework.

##Starting Up the Servlet
You can easily start up the servlet raw using:

```
python3 hello.py
```

By launching the servlet in debug mode, you can edit the service without having to restart it everytime. This also turns on the logger in DEBUG mode.

```
python3 hello.py debug
```

##Starting Up Using Tornado
You can easily start up the servlet in a tornado container:

```
python3 tornadoTest.py
```

Launching via tornado will allow for simultaneous asynchronous connections by clients.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Simple-RAT

**A simple Remote Acces Trojan written in Python.**

Simple Remote Access Trojan I wrote in college to show the principles of such program.
It consists of client and server sides. Besides serving as a C&C, server side provides a web application to interact with infected computers.

**Written for Windows OS & tested only on Win7**. It is not perfect and has some problems, you can experiment with it and change it in any way you want.

Available interactions are browsing and downloading files, browsing through keylogs, and screenshots of user's screen.

# Getting Started

**It's easy to get it running! Just follow these simple steps.**

#### Installing Prerequisites

1. **Installing and configuring FileZilla**
   To get it running on your system, you will have to install and configure a FTP server.

   I used the [**FileZilla Server**](https://filezilla-project.org/) and recommend it for usage.

   You will need this because file upload implemented with FTP protocol.

   Make sure to configure FileZilla Server in the following way: [FileZilla Config](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/blob/master/FileZilla-Config.md).
2. **Installing required packages**

   In order to make it work, install the modules listed in **requirements.txt** with **pip**:

   ```
   pip install  -r <path to requirements.txt>
   ```
3. **Installing PyInstaller**

   This step is not mandatory, but if you'll want to compile the programm to a single executable,

   I recommend using **PyInstaller**:

   ```
   pip install PyInstaller
   ```

   or a GUI version called **Auto PY to EXE**:

   ```
   pip install auto-py-to-exe
   ```

#### Configuring

**After installing all prerequisites and configuring your ftp client, you should configure the client and the server side of the app.**

1. **Configuring the server.**

   Open **server\RAT\_server.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(lines no. 23-24).

   Change HOST and PORT to your address(on this address the server will await incoming connections).
   ```
   23. HOST = ''
   24. PORT = 0
   ```

   Then go to the last line, and change the host and port to ones you want to(on this address the web application for interaction with clients will be served).

   The default option is to listen on all adresses and port **443**.
   ```
   287. https_server = WSGIServer(('0.0.0.0',443), app)
   ```
2. **Configuring the client.**

   Open **client\ftp\_uploader.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(lines no. 6-8).
   Change **host** to address of your FTP server, **user** and **pswd** to the ones you've configured on your FTP server.
   ```
   6. host = # ftp address
   7. user = # username
   8. pswd = # password
   ```

   Open **client\rat.py** with your editor and edit the following lines(39-40).

   Change **HOST** and **PORT** to the address of your server, which you configured in step 1.(On this address the client - infected comp. will make a connection to the server)
   ```
   39. HOST = ''
   40. PORT = 65432
   ```

#### Running

**Running the server.**

1. Run **server\RAT\_server.py** The app will prompt you to register, you will need this in order to access it from the browser.

   [![new user.](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/raw/master/screenshots/server-register.JPG)](/sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT/blob/master/screenshots/server-register.JPG)

   After entering your credentials(remember them), you will be notified that the app is running.
2. Access the app with a browser. Enter the address of the server(You've entered in step 2 of **Configuring the server**).

   Login with credentials from previous step.

**Running the client**

1. Copy the contents of the configured **client** folder to virtual machine(or other computer) and run **client\RAT\_client.py** file.

   It is better to compile it to binary executable and run it instead of python script(for proper work, compile it with **--uac-admin** flag).
2. After running the client, it will copy itself to **appdata** folder and make a new task in **Task Scheduler** to run on start.

After completing these steps, you will be able to interact with computers connected to your server.

These interactions are made with the web app interface and include browsing through user files, downloading them, making screenshots,
 browsing through keylogs and screenshots of user's screen.

# Annotation Tool

This tool was created to interact (visualize, create, modify, remove) with **Bonn Activity Maps**[[1]](https://github.com/bonn-activity-maps/aikapi) datasets. Additionally, the tool supports interactions with **Posetrack**[[2]](https://posetrack.net/) datasets. The following sections contain the explanations of the main functionalities of the tool.

## Screenshots

### User

The tool has a user management system and is therefore protected by a login. This system allows two different types of user:

* **Annotators**: have access to the datasets that have been assigned to them. They can create, modify and delete annotations.
* **Superusers**: have access to all the management functionalities of the tool. They can create/modify/delete users, upload/remove datasets, modify the datasets assigned to each user and create real-time notifications for all the users using the tool.

[![Login image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot2.png)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot2.png)

---

### Multiple views of the scene at the same time

The tool allows to have up to 4 camera views simultaneously to interact with. This views can be switched at all times with the ones stored in the views storage panel situated on the right of the tool.
The storage panel hides when not being used.

Since all the views are synchronized, moving through the timeline will update all the views to match the actual frame.

[![Mutiple views image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot1.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot1.jpg)

---

### Annotations

The tool allows different types of objects; "Persons", "Poses" and "Boxes". Each object has an individual and unique UID for fast identification. Multiple objects can be visualized at the same time.
(TODO: maybe show the process focusing in a single person and show all assigned object types and actions to that UID)

[![Poses image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot3.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot3.jpg)

##### Visualization

In the Keypoint editor you can visualize which frames (top row) have annotations for each object (first column). There are also special operations that can be perfomed at an object level and for a range of frames(red buttons):

1. Batch delete annotations.
2. Swap the UIDs of two objects.
3. For Poses, enforce all limbs' length.

[![KeypointEditor image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot4.png)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot4.png)

##### Modification

Each object can be individually edited for each individual frame:

1. Each position of the keypoints can be modified by clicking or dragging.
2. The length of the limbs can be changed and enforced, so that the involved keypoints always respect that length constraints.
3. It is possible to delete the whole annotation or each individual keypoint.

In order to speed up the annotation process several operations can be performed:

1. **Interpolate**: searches the previous closest annotated frame for that object and interpolates all the frames in between.
2. **Autocomplete**: searches the previous closest annotated frame and copies its content to all the frames in between. This operation can be performed at an object or tag level.

Saving the annotation interpolates automatically (this option can be disabled in the Options Panel that will be shown later).

[![KeypointEditor Editor image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot5.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot5.jpg)

##### Boxes

The objects of type "Box" are considered static and their behaviour is different. They represent entities whose position and orientation barely change during the whole recording, for example, chairs, tables, fridges, etc.

Each "Box" object has a *label* field to mark them as specific real-world objects (chair, table, fridge, etc.). When creating/editing a static object, changes will be replicated forward in the timeline, so all following frames will be also updated.

[![Boxes image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot8.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot8.jpg)

##### 3D process

Since the datasets expect the annotations to be in 3D, the tool provides some aid to ease the process. When a keypoint is placed in one of the views, *epipolar* lines will appear on the other views. This lines can be used as a reference of where should the keypoint lie in that view. Once a point is placed in at least 2 different views, we can save it. The tool will then triangulate those points and generate the final 3D point.

[![Epipolar image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot7.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot7.jpg)

##### Actions

Users can also annotate the actions being performed by each "Person". This actions can be visualized directly on the views.

[![Actions 1 image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot13.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot13.jpg)

In the Actions Editor Panel, new actions can be created, specifying *action type*, *start frame* and *end frame*, and deleted.

[![Actions 2 image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot12.jpg)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot12.jpg)

---

### Options and shortcuts

The tool lets the user change some options so that everything fits his/her specific preferences.

[![Options image](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/raw/develop/images/screenshot11.png)](https://github.com/Belberus/ThanosDidNothingWrong/blob/develop/images/screenshot11.png)

Almost every action that the user can perform has a keyboard shortcut to speed up the annotation process. This shortcuts are available for different keyboard layouts to fit everyone.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

POC of ML implementation for sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews using Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is a proof-of-concept of a problem solved using Machine Learning techniques. We perform sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative reviews.

Based on an algorithm from Sebastian Raschka's Python Machine Learning book using SciKit and NTLK.

The directory *webapp* contains a flask based application that uses the trained classifier to make predictions and provide feedback for improving the classifier. The app is publicly hosted at <http://rohitnayak.pythonanywhere.com>

The provided IPython notebook contains some key code snippets that illustrate the concepts of this ML project.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# bt\_lnmp 基于宝塔面板的LNMP环境

## 下载必要文件

<https://github.com/piaoyunsoft/bt_lnmp.git> 里面的www目录就是宝塔初始化需要的目录，将其挂载到容器里面使数据持久化，下面将进行映射。

## 启动容器

* 方法1：

```
docker run -i -t -d --name bt_lnmp_test -p 20:20 -p 21:21 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 888:888 -p 8888:8888 --privileged=true -v $PWD/www:/www piaoyun/bt_lnmp:1.0 bash /start.sh

```

* 方法2：

```
docker-compose up -d

```

## 面板入口：<http://IP:8888/admin>

```
用户名：piao
密码：baota1234
数据库root密码：baota1234

```

切记：每次启动面板，需要进入后台手动启动Nginx、PHP和MySQL服务

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# ROBO-TOM

A service-oriented web application for carrying out computed tomography experiments with data processing (numpy, scipy) and visualization. Currently used in the laboratory in Institute of Crystallograhy. The system enables multiple users to take CT scans, store (mongoDB, HDF5) and browse collected imagery via a web-based UI (Django, Flask) operating on top of a TANGO-based network interface to CT hardware.

<http://xtomo.ru>

Documentation: <http://rbtm.readthedocs.org/>

# Usage howto

```
pg_dump -h localhost -p 15432 -U postgres robotom_users > robotom_users_dump_<date>
restore:
createdb -h localhost -p 15432 -U postgres -T template0 robotom_users
psql -h localhost -p 15432 -U postgres robotom_users < robotom_users_dump_<date>

```

NEW:

Если не работает streamView или двигатели выполнить команду:

```
docker stop drivers_server_1 experiment_server_1
```

Если не работет томограф, то убедиться, что источник прогрет и выполнить:

```
~/rbtm/drivers/restart.sh
```

BUILD:

```
cd ~/rbtm/drivers/tango_ds
source tango_env/bin/activate
sudo rm /home/robotom/rbtm/drivers/logs/*.log
cd ../../drivers
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

```

Configure port forwarding

```
#crontab -e
@reboot autossh -M 20100 -f -N -R 5080:localhost:5080 makov@109.234.38.83
@reboot autossh -M 20110 -f -N -R 5443:localhost:5443 makov@109.234.38.83

```

To configure iptables on the gate (add to the start of /etc/ufw/before/rules (no longer needed):

```
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5080
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5443
COMMIT

```

Allow access to 5080, 5006 port from docker container:

```
sudo ufw allow in on docker0 to any port 5080
sudo ufw allow in on docker0 to any port 5006

```

# Data Stream Algorithm Benchmark

A benchmark intended for testing the performance of various data stream algorithms for multiple datasets in a simple way.

## Requirements

* Both python2(>=2.7) and python3(>=3.5) are required.
* For python2, matplotlib and future packages are needed:
  + `pip2 install matplotlib==2 future`
* [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

## How to build

First, you need to clone this repo, and install the python3 dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/DSAB-local/DSAB
cd pku-sketch-benchmark
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the default datasets.

```
sh download.sh
```

## How to start

For the first time, you need to run `env.sh` to set up some environmental variables. Then, initiate the database.

```
source env.sh
flask init-db
```

To start the system, run the following command:

```
sh run.sh
```

Now, you can type in `<your-ip-address>:8086/skbm/index.html` in your web browser to access the benchmark interface.

## How to use

To make it more convenient and easier to use, we have built up a website for datastreams algorithms benchmarking. When you visit the home page, there are several modules to configure before running experiments and drawing graphs.

#### Select datasets

The first module is the dataset module. You need to choose one or more network datasets, and the selected datasets would be fed to each experiments of different parameter settings respectively. When you hover over a dataset button, the info about this dataset would pop out. Once you clicked the dataset, the corresponding button would turn to grey.

#### Generate new datasets

Though there are some existing datasets available, you can click the button at the bottom of this module to generate your own dataset. In the dataset generating page, you need to choose a distribution and fill out the form and submit the request to generate a dataset. Once you have done, you can go back to the home page and the generated dataset should be shown in the first module.

#### Experiments setup

The main function of the benchmark lies in the second module, where you can perform grid search experiments over multiple parameters. Here we assume an experiment is defined by a particular sketch combined with a specific task. Within each experiment setup, you should first choose a sketch and a task, and then the corresponding parameters would have shown below. Each row defines a value range of a parameter. If you only need a single value for a parameter, you can only fill out the “from” box and leave the other two alone. If you want to perform multiple experiments, click the button at the bottom of this module.

#### Add new sketch algorithms

To test your own sketch algorithm, you can upload your own sketch code by clicking the last item of the sketch dropdown button. When redirecting to the new page and uploading your code, you need to provide the name of your sketch algorithm. It is recommended to use "xxxSketch" pattern. The name should be different from all the existing sketch algorithms in this benchmark, or the original sketch with the same name would be overwriten. Then, specify all the hyperparameters that should be defined before experimenting your algorithms. Finally, copy and paste your code in the code box and submit and compile your code. Notice that you may fail to compile the code. When this happens, your code won't be recorded and you need to check your code. Sometimes you want to change your algorithm after having submission and compilation. By simply submitting your updated code with the same sketch name can overwrite the original version of code. When you finished, click the navigation icon at the top of the page to go back to the main page.

#### Run the experiments

After configuring the first two modules, click `ready to go` to start running experiments at the back ends. This may take some time, depending on your configuration.

#### The Graph module

The experimental results will send back to the front end, and the user can visualize the results by using **Graph** module. This module requires specific configuration for each point. Y axis in the second module is the same as the first module. X label is the name of x axis in the graph. For each point, you need to specify which line it belongs to, the position of the point in the x axis, and the index of the experiment that you want to draw value from. All the experiemnts are shown below the search box, and you can search particular experiment by typing keywords.

#### Sample result

When you finish configuring the graph module, click the `draw` button, and the figure would be generated in the backend. You can click `Get the Graph!` to see the figure, or you can also share the link with others.

---

## Authorization

To authorize send username and password (Basic auth) to `/api/login`.

```
$ curl -u user_name:user_pass http://<url>/api/login

```

In response you will get a access and refresh tokens. To authenticate in resources endpoints put access token to `x-access-tokens` header's field.

```
$ curl -H "x-access-tokens: <token>" http://<url>/api/users/1

```

To refresh tokens send a valid refresh token to `/api/refresh`.

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST -d'{refresh_token:"<tok>"}' http://<url>/api/refresh

```

---

Don't forget add `Content-Type: application/json` header to your requests!
All requests (except authorization requests) require a set `x-access-tokens` header.

---

## Pagination, Sorting

In requests to resource's endpoints (method `GET`) you can set additional parameters:

* `start` - first returned elem from list (default: 1)
* `limit` - max returned elements (default: 25 or `DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT` in config field)
* `sort_by`- coma separated list of table fields, use `asc(field)`, `desc(field)` to set direction of sort

URI examples:

* `/api/clients?start=21&limit=10` - 10 clients, starting from 21
* `/api/places?sort_by=asc(zone),nr` - places sorted by `zone` and then by `nr`

Continuous integration, testing, releasing and kitchen sinks for git
====================================================================

With golem, every git commit, push or tag can set into motion a set of actions
that you determine. From running tests on every push to automatically creating
releases and uploading them to various points. It's all possible.

Does this remind you of anything? Of course! Jenkins!

This proect very much aims to be "not Jenkins" and was started because Jenkins
frustrated me. Specifically:

- It's not java. Not that ava is a bad language, but writing simple extensions
  is a pain and Golem is meant to be trivial to extend.
- Testing is *not* the main thing that can be done
- Modular build with workers and actions that can depend on each other
- Though it's written in python, other languages are fist-class. You do not
  need to write workers  in python.
- You can configure golem with plain text files
- You can run multiple actions for the same repo (or even the same commit!) at
  the same time

Golem is currently in alpha stage. Though I'm using it to release all my own
software, I'm still changing golem and its API for workers.

```
