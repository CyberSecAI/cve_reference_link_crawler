The web server used by MikroTik RouterOS version 6 is affected by a heap memory corruption issue. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can corrupt the server's heap memory by sending a crafted HTTP request. As a result, the web interface crashes and is immediately restarted. The issue was fixed in RouterOS 6.49.10 stable. RouterOS version 7 is not affected.
