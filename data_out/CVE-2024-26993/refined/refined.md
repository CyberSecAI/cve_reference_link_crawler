{
  "CVE-2024-26993": {
    "description": "The `sysfs_break_active_protection()` routine in the Linux kernel has a reference leak in its error path. If the call to `kernfs_find_and_get()` fails, the `kn` variable will be `NULL`, and the reference to `kobj` acquired at the start of the function will not be released. This issue is resolved by adding an explicit `kobject_put()` call when `kn` is `NULL`.",
    "root_cause": "A reference leak occurs in the error path of `sysfs_break_active_protection()` due to a missing `kobject_put()` call.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Reference leak"
    ],
    "impact": "The reference leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially cause system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when `kernfs_find_and_get()` fails within the `sysfs_break_active_protection()` function.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to trigger the `sysfs_break_active_protection()` function in such a way that `kernfs_find_and_get()` fails is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "patch": "The fix adds a `kobject_put(kobj)` call in the error path when `kn` is `NULL`"
