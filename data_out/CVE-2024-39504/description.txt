In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_inner: validate mandatory meta and payload

Check for mandatory netlink attributes in payload and meta expression
when used embedded from the inner expression, otherwise NULL pointer
dereference is possible from userspace.
