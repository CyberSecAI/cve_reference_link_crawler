Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions set on the `/var/run/zabbix` directory during Zabbix installation from RPM packages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DAC\_OVERRIDE SELinux Capability:** The Zabbix installation process utilizes the `DAC_OVERRIDE` SELinux capability. This capability, when improperly used, allows Zabbix Proxy or Server processes to bypass standard file system permission checks (read, write, execute) on files within the `/var/run/zabbix` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing File System Permissions:** This vulnerability enables Zabbix processes to ignore the intended file system permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or execution of files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Zabbix RPM installation process. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability if they have access to the system where Zabbix is installed from RPM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to have some form of access to the system where Zabbix is installed using RPM packages and the Zabbix processes are running.
*   The attacker would be able to leverage the Zabbix processes.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.3, which is considered low severity.
*   The issue was reported by Brian J. Murrell.
*   The vulnerability affects Zabbix versions 4.0.0 - 4.0.36, 5.0.0 – 5.0.18, 5.4.0 – 5.4.8, and 6.0.0alpha1-6.0.0alpha7
*   The issue was fixed in versions 5.0.19rc1, 5.4.9rc1, 6.0.0beta1 and 6.0
