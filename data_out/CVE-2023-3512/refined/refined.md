- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a relative path traversal flaw in the "Download file" parameter of Setelsa Security's ConacWin CB software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to relative path traversal (CWE-22, CWE-23), allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform an arbitrary download of files from the system. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to perform the attack. They only need network access to the vulnerable system.
