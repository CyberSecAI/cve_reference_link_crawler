Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `system reset-system-password` command within the Gradle Enterprise Admin CLI processes the provided password. Specifically, the password is parsed by a command shell before being passed to a script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because the password is parsed by a command shell, an attacker can embed shell commands within the password string. These commands will then be executed on the server, within the context of an "enterprise-app" pod instance.
*   **Password Leakage:** The password is also passed as an argument to a script, making it briefly visible in the process list within the pod.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting malicious commands into the password, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the "enterprise-app" pod instance.
*   **Password Disclosure:** The password, though only briefly, is exposed in the process list. This could potentially leak the password to an attacker if they have sufficient access to view process information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `system reset-system-password` command of the Gradle Enterprise Admin CLI.
*   The attacker must be able to use the Admin CLI to reset the system password
*   The attacker must have sufficient administration privileges to execute commands within the "enterprise-app" container. These privileges are determined by the access control of the Kubernetes cluster.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must have access to the Gradle Enterprise Admin CLI.
*   They need to have the necessary administrative privileges to execute commands within the Kubernetes container where the "enterprise-app" pod is running. This includes the ability to run the `system reset-system-password` command.
*   The attacker also needs the ability to run commands within the "enterprise-app" container.

**Summary**

The vulnerability allows an attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands within the application container by injecting commands in a password when resetting a system password. Additionally, the password itself is briefly exposed in the process list.
