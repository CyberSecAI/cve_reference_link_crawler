- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Motorola Device Help application temporarily stores logs on the SD card when the user sends them to Motorola.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of sensitive log data on the SD card.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read the logging data, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the device's SD card can access the log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device or the ability to access the SD card via other means.
