Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-34543:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control in Intel® RAID Web Console software.
- This vulnerability affects all versions of the software.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: An authenticated user can potentially gain higher privileges than intended.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system where the Intel® RAID Web Console software is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- User interaction is required (UI:R), which means the attacker needs some level of user cooperation to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` provides additional context. It specifies that the attack vector is local (AV:L), the attack complexity is high (AC:H), the required privileges are low (PR:L), user interaction is required (UI:R) the scope is unchanged (S:U) and the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability is high (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- Intel has discontinued the RAID Web Console software and will not release updates to mitigate this vulnerability. They recommend migrating to newer generation products.
