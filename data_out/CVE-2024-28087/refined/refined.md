Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28087:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2024-28087**:  Identified as an "IDOR due to the absence of [dynamic authorization checking](identity/rest-api-authorization#dynamic_authorization) in Community edition"

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of dynamic authorization checks within the Community Edition of Bonita REST APIs. This means that access control checks were not properly implemented for resources, allowing potential unauthorized access.

**Weakness:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is an IDOR issue. Without proper authorization, attackers could potentially access or manipulate resources they shouldn't have access to directly by referencing their identifiers.
*   **Missing Dynamic Authorization:** The absence of dynamic authorization checks allowed the IDOR vulnerability to exist within the Community edition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources via REST API calls.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Attackers might be able to modify or delete data they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API Calls:** The attack vector is through manipulating parameters in REST API calls to access resources without proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Bonita application to make REST API calls.
*   **Basic API knowledge:** The attacker needs some basic knowledge of how to interact with REST APIs.
*   **No user authentication required:** The vulnerability exists because of missing authorization checks, implying that authentication may not be sufficient to prevent exploitation

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mohammad Aâ€™mir.
*   This issue is classified as medium severity
*   The fix for this issue is mentioned as enabling the dynamic authorization mechanism for REST APIs in the community edition.

This documentation provides more context and detail than the basic CVE description, explaining the nature of the IDOR vulnerability and how the missing authorization checks lead to the vulnerability.
