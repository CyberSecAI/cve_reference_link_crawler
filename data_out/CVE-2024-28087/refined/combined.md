# Release notes

## Bonita UI Builder

We are excited to announce the release of [Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder), our new and enhanced development environment for creating all kind of interfaces, pages and forms for your applications! It brings along a host of advanced features and improved usability, designed to help you create compelling, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

Key benefits:

* Rapidly create and deploy UIs to reduce time to market
* Connect UIs with Bonitasoft for end-to-end alignment
* Tailor UIs to specific needs with advanced options
* A drag-and-drop interface empowers all users, regardless of technical skill
* Built with React for dynamic, responsive design

Features include:

* Drag & drop tools, 45+ widgets, React interfaces
* Code completion, custom JavaScript, native debugging
* Full Bonita Runtime compatibility

You can continue to use Bonita UI Designer as usual, while also having the opportunity to explore and get familiar with the capabilities of Bonita UI Builder.

Eventually, Bonita UI Designer will be phased out as we progressively transition to Bonita UI Builder. Rest assured, we are committed to providing comprehensive support and resources throughout this process. Our goal is to make this transition as smooth as possible, minimizing any disruption to your workflow.

Here’s what you can expect during this transition period:

* Continued access: Bonita UI Designer will remain fully operational for an extended period, allowing ample time for adaptation
* Support and resources: We offer extensive documentation, tutorials, and support to help you make the most of [Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder)
* Facilitated transition: We are dedicated to facilitate the transition, with detailed guides on how to use Bonita UI Builder, as well as [professional services support](https://www.bonitasoft.com/professional-services/on-demand-services)

## New available values

### Application Links

You can now use application links. See [Applications with Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder) for more details. Community users can also integrate their own links for applications developed with other tools.
See [FAQ](applications/ui-builder/faq) for common problems and solutions (e.g. if you use a customized or an old layout).

[Engine APIs](api/engine-api-overview) that allowed applications manipulation still work with legacy applications and have been deprecated in favor of new APIs that manipulate both application links and legacy applications.

[REST APIs](api/rest-api-overview) (see *Application* section) now also return application links in addition of legacy applications.

## Support matrix changes

### PostgreSQL update

Support for PostgreSQL has been updated to version **16.4**. See [hardware and software requirements](runtime/hardware-and-software-requirements) for the full matrix support.

### Ubuntu update

Support for Ubuntu has been updated to version **22.04**. See [hardware and software requirements](runtime/hardware-and-software-requirements) for the full matrix support.

## Feature deprecations and removals

### Database support

Due to the cost of maintenance of multiple DBMS, we are removing support for the following databases in the Community edition:

* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle

These databases will still be supported in Enterprise editions.

### Deprecated APIs

#### License API

The Rest API `GET /API/platform/license` is now replaced by `GET /API/system/information`. This latter requires to be logged in as a user with the "Admin" profile. See [dedicated Rest API documentation](https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Information/operation/getSystemInformation) for more details.

The corresponding Java API `com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PlatformAPI#getInformation()` is also deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Note that this new API is now also available in the Community edition and provides information about the case counters limit and current consumption.

## Bug fixes

### Fixes in Bonita 2024.3-u1 (2024-12-10)

#### Fixes in Bonita Runtime including Bonita Applications

* RUNTIME-1786 - When updating an SCA application with profiles mapping, the log is deceitful
* RUNTIME-1870 - REST API: JSON in the HTTP GET response cannot be parsed /API/bpm/caseInfo/{id}
* RUNTIME-1885 - Doubtful queries on application\_\* tables each time we navigate to a page
* RUNTIME-1889 - Super Admin App page is refreshed for each page switch
* RUNTIME-1911 - Using tenantid column in index causing query performance degradation

#### Fixes in Bonita Studio (including Bonita UI Designer)

* STUDIO-4477 - Some reserved keyword (limit) are missing during validation on Business Data Attributes
* STUDIO-4516 - Errors at .bos file import and migration
* STUDIO-4540 - Cloning a community project into a Subscription studio should migrate the internal build for subscription
* STUDIO-4542 - Due to Maven archetype plugin update, rest api generation generates invalid test class
* STUDIO-4543 - Rest API Extension validation fails with NPE when project folder and artifactId does not match
* STUDIO-4547 - Git repository clone failed when migrating a project which has already been cloned in the workspace.
* STUDIO-4551 - Bonita Project Analyze Plugin Market Type error
* UID-732 - $form.$invalid x Tabs container : the Submit button is enabled when the widgets' Required of the current tab have a value, and even if there are empty Required widgets in other tabs

### Fixes in Bonita 2024.3-b3 (2024/08/29)

#### Fixes in Bonita Runtime (including Bonita Applications)

* RUNTIME-48 - SFlowNodeNotFoundException: Quartz’s Trigger associated to a Boundary timer does not get deleted when the process instance terminates
* RUNTIME-1895 - [SAML & OIDC SSO]: Bonita redirects to IdP if redirected target URL request lands on different node than the one where the original request was received

### Fixes in Bonita 2024.3-b2 (2024/07/26)

#### Fixes in Bonita Runtime (including Bonita Applications)

* RUNTIME-1697 - Avoid reading configuration from database, in favor to caching

  Bonita Runtime makes heavy usage of **cache** to improve performance. In that context, most configuration changes require **server restart** to be taken into account. In particular, all SSO activations and configuration changes fall into this category (OIDC, SAML, Kerberos, JAAS, …​).
* RUNTIME-1877 - Session Sharing x sameSiteCookies value systematically set to "lax" when cluster is enabled. [New configuration properties](runtime/install-a-bonita-bpm-cluster) specific to cluster mode and session cookie have been added.
* RUNTIME-1883 - Add extra java 17 open packages instructions for Bundle packaging
* RUNTIME-1884 - `password` attribute silently removed from `org.bonitasoft.engine.identity.impl.UserImpl` class. Add removal information in the release note. Make the XStream deserialization less strict to avoid deserialization exception when a some fields are unknown.
* RUNTIME-1887 - Regression in ServerProxifier algorithm produce a greater number of SQL requests.
* RUNTIME-1890 - [LDAP Synchronizer] - Add add-opens for packaged scripts

#### Fixes in Bonita Studio (including Bonita UI Designer)

* STUDIO-4517 - Old version Git repository clone fails with DirectoryNotEmptyException if REST API extension does not contain pom.xml file
* STUDIO-4515 NPE generated during project migration
* STUDIO-4526 - Cannot add or edit a database connector
* STUDIO-4530 - ResourceException at Studio 9.0.4 restart after a Switch Workspace to exisitng workspace from a 9.0.3
* STUDIO-4531 - Getting started tutorial not working out of the box in Subscription editions.
* STUDIO-4533 - Refreshing a project after a git switch branch now adds/removes submodules as expected.
* STUDIO-4535 - Renaming a project without bdm or extensions fails
* STUDIO-4536 - Hazecalst discovery is enabled by default for Studio embedded Runtime

### Fixes in Bonita 2024.3-b1 (2024/07/04)

#### Fixes in Bonita Runtime (including Bonita Applications)

* RUNTIME-1697 - Avoid reading configuration from database, in favor to caching

  Bonita Runtime makes heavy usage of **cache** to improve performance. In that context, most configuration changes require **server restart** to be taken into account. In particular, all SSO activations and configuration changes fall into this category (OIDC, SAML, Kerberos, JAAS, …​).

# Release notes

|  | The required Java version is now **Java 17**. |
| --- | --- |

We’re proud to announce Bonita 2024.1, the first major Bonita platform release of this year!
This new major release improves security, search capabilities and performance.

## The 2024.1 release in a nutshell

* Java 17 update for more security, better performance and language enhancements
* Improved security in Bonita REST APIs
* Boosted search experience on all APIs and pages
* Better platform performance thanks to the L2 Cache (Enterprise Edition only), extended to clustered environments.
* Bonita Studio packaging changes
* REST API authorizations in Community edition
* Find out how Bonitasoft handles GDPR

## New available values

### Bonita Runtime

#### Java 17 update

We’re updating to the next long-term support (LTS) Java version: Java 17.
Worldwide adoption of Java 17 has been growing since last year, including among our Bonita users. In Bonita 2024.1, we have updated the version from 11 to 17!

Following the Java 17 update, it is now required to specify the following jvm arguments when using the `bonita-client` library in a standalone application:

```
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
```

#### Docker image parent update

The `bonita` and `bonitasoft.jfrog.io/docker/bonita-subscription` images now inherit from the official [eclipse-temurin](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) image in its alpine flavor. As a consequence, if you need to add additional Certificate Authority in the Java TrustStore you may proceed like [described here](runtime/bonita-docker-installation#adding-ca-certificates). It also applies to [Self Contained Application images](build-run/application-overview).

#### Second-Level Cache available in a Bonita clustered environment

|  | For Subscription editions only. |
| --- | --- |

Bonita 2024.1 now handles second-level caching data (also known as L2 Cache) when running Bonita within a [cluster environment](runtime/overview-of-bonita-bpm-in-a-cluster).

It is available by default with a preset configuration. It can be disabled by setting the property `bonita.platform.persistence.use_second_level_cache=false` or the environment variable `BONITA_PLATFORM_PERSISTENCE_USE_SECOND_LEVEL_CACHE=false`.

This L2 Cache mechanism is implemented with [Hazelcast](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/cache/overview). At the same time, it replaces the Ehcache implementation that was previously used to support L2 caching data within a non-cluster environment.

For more information on how to tune the L2 Cache with Bonita, please refer to the [dedicated documentation](runtime/performance-tuning#persistence-cache).

#### Like-based search

Bonita 2024.1 introduces a new search engine algorithm on all APIs and the Bonita pages included by default on Bonita User Application, Bonita Administrator and Super Administrator Applications. This new “like-based” search algorithm replaces the previous “word-based” search and it will allow you to rapidly find all matching records for a given search string anywhere in a phrase or a word.
This is now the default search behavior for all search APIs and pages of Bonita Runtime.

The result is simple: a better understanding of your queries without any configuration changes!

For more information on how like-based search works, please refer to the [dedicated documentation](api/using-list-and-search-methods#like_based_search).

### Development suite

#### Bonita Studio packaging changes

All Bonita Studio binaries now embed a Java runtime. The former "all-in-one" archive which was mixing both Windows and Linux environment will not be published anymore.

The Linux binaries are now published as `tar.gz` archives only, while Windows and MacOs platforms still uses an installer.
Consult [Bonita Studio installation article](bonita-studio-download-installation) for more information.

### Bonita UI Designer

## Functional changes

### Oracle case-insensitiveness

The Oracle search is now case-insensitive.

### REST API authorizations in Community edition

In order to improve security of Bonita Runtime REST API, the [dynamic authorization mechanism](identity/rest-api-authorization#dynamic_authorization) has been extended to Bonita Runtime community edition but it is limited to the set of provided rules and default configuration for Bonita REST API resources and cannot be extended. Customizing an extensibility (new PermissionRules definition) remains available in the subscription editions only.
Dynamic authorizations are active by default, and although it is not advised, it can still be deactivated to avoid 403 errors using a property (see [dedicated doc page](identity/rest-api-authorization#dynamic_authorization)).

## Feature deprecations and removals

### Word-based search

The optional "word-based" and default "start-with" search algorithms cannot be used anymore as they have been replaced by a "like-based" search algorithm that is used in all search APIs and pages of Bonita Runtime.

### API Removals

#### All editions

| Class#Method | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| `org-com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PermissionAPI#checkAPICallWithScript(String className, APICallContext apiCallContext, boolean reload)` | It was deprecated since Bonita 2022.1. Use `org-com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PermissionAPI#isAllowed` instead to execute both static and dynamic permissions check. |

## Configuration changes

### Word-based search

Since "Word-based" search can no longer be used, its configuration has been removed.

The properties `bonita.platform.persistence.platform.enableWordSearch` and `bonita.platform.persistence.tenant.enableWordSearch` are removed from the configuration file `platform_engine/bonita-platform-community-custom.properties` when using the update tool, and they no longer have any effect.

If you used them to configure Bonita Runtime for "word-based" search and specified some objects to exclude using the bean `wordSearchExclusionMappings` in `platform_engine/bonita-platform-custom.xml`, you should remove this bean after updating since it is no longer used. The new "like-based" search is active on all objects that have API search methods.

### REST API authorizations

The property allowing to enable/disable [dynamic authorization checks](identity/rest-api-authorization#dynamic_authorization) has been moved from the configuration file `bonita-tenant-sp-custom.properties` to the file `bonita-tenant-community-custom.properties` in the tenant folder when using the setup tool. When updating Bonita in Subscription editions, if the property was used, Bonita update tool will keep its value. When the property is set using a system property or an environment variable, it will continue to override the value of the configuration file.

## Bug fixes
