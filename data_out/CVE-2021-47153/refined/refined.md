{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The i2c-i801 driver, after enabling interrupt support, was triggering an interrupt when attempting to recover from a timed-out transaction by setting the KILL bit. The interrupt handler was not designed to handle this specific situation, leading to potential out-of-range memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper interrupt handling",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "An out-of-range memory access could lead to a system crash or other undefined behavior.",
     "attack_vectors": "A timed-out I2C transaction on the i801 bus would trigger the bus reset logic which in turn would trigger the interrupt.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to trigger a timed-out I2C transaction on a system using the affected i2c-i801 driver."
  },
  "affected_component": "i2c-i801 driver",
  "fixes": [
      "Disable interrupts while resetting the bus after a timed-out transaction. Interrupts are re-enabled for subsequent transactions."
