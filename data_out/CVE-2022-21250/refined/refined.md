    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access or modify sensitive financial data related to GL accounts within the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need network access to the targeted Oracle E-Business Suite instance, and would need to exploit the vulnerability through HTTP requests.
