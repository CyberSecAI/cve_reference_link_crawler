- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A leftover debug command (`debug`) in the router's CLI allows for arbitrary command execution if a specific password is provided. The password is derived from the LAN MAC address of the device by concatenating "admin" to it and taking the first 16 bytes of its MD5 hash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The debug command should have been removed or protected before the product's release. The password calculation is predictable since it is based on the device's LAN MAC address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain a full Linux shell on the router, leading to complete control over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have network access to the router and be able to SSH into it, requiring valid admin credentials for the web portal (and therefore SSH access). After login, the attacker can use the debug command via the router's CLI shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have valid admin credentials to access the web portal and SSH into the router.
    - The attacker needs to know the LAN MAC address of the router to generate the required password.
    - Once logged in via SSH, the attacker can send the debug command and then provide the correct password.
