* **CVE(s):** CVE-2023–31046
* **Vendor:** PaperCut
* **Product:** PaperCut MF/NG
* **Version(s) affected:** < 22.1.1
* **Fixed version:** 22.1.1

## Background [#](#background)

An Authenticated Arbitrary File Download vulnerability was found in PaperCut NG/MF. PaperCut is a popular Print Management product that’s used globally by over 80,000 organisations. Its application server component is written in Java. The majority of customers run their servers behind firewalls, however a number of larger customers like universities may have it hosted on more open servers. As part of my research I found this vulnerability and I worked with PaperCut Software to report, advise and validate a fix. The latest release of PaperCut NG/MF which can be found at `http://www.papercut.com/` has the vulnerability addressed and upgrading is the recommended mitigation.

Arbitrary File Download/Read vulnerabilities can occur when an application allows files to be included in an unsafe way on a local machine, often through Directory Traversal techniques (being the root cause) whereby the application directory structure can be traversed to reach areas not originally intended by the developer.

In the case of PaperCut, the application server defines a servlet that can be accessed, with authentication (testing determined this could be the lowest level of
authentication available), allowing for a crafted HTTP request to be sent that retrieves files from the underlying filesystem.

Within the `web.xml` configuration file for the PaperCut application software, the `static-content-files` servlet exists to allow for static content to be retrieved / displayed to the user.

```
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>static-content-files</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/content/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

```

The affected Java code is available within the `getStaticContent()` function inside the `UIContentResource.class`:

```
  @GET
  @Path("static/{asset:.*}")
  @CacheControlHeader("max-age=600,public")
  public Response getStaticContent(@PathParam("asset") String asset) {
    try {
      File page = getResourceAsFile("/ui/static/" + asset);
      String contentType = MimeTypeUtils.getMimeTypeStringFromFileName(page.getName());
      return Response.ok(page, contentType).build();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }
  }

  private File getResourceAsFile(String resourcePath) {
    String docroot = this._servletContext.getRealPath("/");
    return new File(docroot, resourcePath);
  }

```

As shown above within the code-block above, the `@PathParam("asset")` excerpt refers to the portion of the URL that is controllable by an authenticated user, which can be manipulated without further sanitisation being performed on the input. Once the crafted parameter has been passed into the `getResourceAsFile()` function, a new file object is created containing the contents of the requested file.

In this case, anything related to the application such as API keys (within `/papercut/server/data/`), as well as anything accessible on the filesystem such as
`/etc/passwd`, `/proc/self/environ` can be downloaded by an attacker.

```
GET /ui/static/..//..//..//..//..//..//..//etc//passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: papercut:9192
Cookie: <..omitted..>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0
Accept: application/font-woff2;q=1.0,application/font-woff;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://papercut:9192/ui/static
Sec-Fetch-Dest: font
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Te: trailers
Connection: close

```

The HTTP response of the above request will contain the requested `/etc/passwd` file contents.

Depending on the user that the papercut application server is running as, the available files will vary - however at the very minimum files that lie within the papercut application server directories will be disclosed including API secrets (allowing for authenticated API calls to be made).

## Recommendations [#](#recommendations)

Mitigations were discussed with the PaperCut Software security team and they’ve provided me with following guidance for inclusion within this public disclosure.

“We feel the best course of action for customers is for them to upgrade to the latest release of PaperCut NG/MF which contains fixes for this issue. We will make this clear through our release notes and our check-for-updates feature. We feel the mitigation put into the code is very effective and a good outcome. It has both a mix of your suggestions and the ideas that our security team came up with. Good security comes through a diversity of thought, and we really wanted to call out this as a great example. It’s been amazing working with you, sharing ideas, on how to address this both efficiently and quickly. Often security CVE reports are very one-way. Your collaboration on both mitigation and validation has been a standout. It really demonstrates the importance of ISVs and Infosec providers working together. This aspect is often understated in security research and uplift.”

info

For other Security vulnerability and Security bulletin information, see our [Security vulnerability information and common security questions](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/CommonSecurityQuestions/) page.

We have received two vulnerability reports from a 3rd party cyber security company ([Trend Micro](#acknowledgements)), for high/critical severity security issues in PaperCut MF/NG. **We have evidence to suggest that unpatched servers are being exploited in the wild.**

* Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2023–27350 / ZDI-CAN-18987 / ZDI-23–233)
* User account data vulnerability (CVE-2023–27351 / ZDI-CAN-19226 / ZDI-23–232)

![danger icon](https://cdn1.papercut.com/web/img/icon/alert-important-icon.svg)
Critical

Please note that as of 18th April, 2023 (see “When was the exploit first detected in the wild?” in the [FAQs](#faqs)) we have evidence to suggest that unpatched servers are being exploited in the wild, (particularly ZDI-CAN-18987 / PO-1216 / ZDI-23–233).

Our immediate advice is to upgrade your PaperCut Application Servers to one of the fixed versions listed below if you haven’t already.

If you suspect that your server has been compromised, we recommend taking server backups, then wiping the Application Server, and rebuilding the Application Server and restoring the database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior. We have also updated the [FAQ](#faqs) “How do I know if my server has been exploited?” question below.

![caution icon](https://cdn1.papercut.com/web/img/icon/alert-caution-icon.svg)
Important

Both of these vulnerabilities have been **fixed** in PaperCut MF and PaperCut NG versions **20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 and later**. We highly recommend upgrading to one of these versions containing the fix (see the [Where can I get the upgrade?](#faqs) question below).
## ZDI-CAN-18987 / PO-1216 / ZDI-23–233

*(also identified as CVE-2023–27350)*

We have confirmed that under certain circumstances this allows for an unauthenticated attacker to get Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a PaperCut Application Server. This could be done remotely and without the need to log in.

*This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 9.8.*

## ZDI-CAN-19226 / PO-1219 / ZDI-23–232

*(also identified as CVE-2023–27351)*

We have confirmed that under certain circumstances this allows for an unauthenticated attacker to potentially pull information about a user stored within PaperCut MF or NG - including usernames, full names, email addresses, office/department info and any card numbers associated with the user. The attacker can also retrieve the hashed passwords for **internal** PaperCut-created users only (note that this does **not** include any password hashes for users sync’d from directory sources such as Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace / Active Directory and others). This could be done remotely and without the need to log in. We do not have any evidence of this vulnerability being used against customers at this point.

*This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 8.2.*

Yes, the [New PaperCut RCE exploit created that bypasses existing detections](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-papercut-rce-exploit-created-that-bypasses-existing-detections/) article is referring to exploiting the same vulnerability, in a way that the activity is not easily detected in the Sysmon or PaperCut MF application log. The method of exploiting PaperCut MF mentioned in the article is mitigated in versions 20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 and later.

Q Is there more information available about these vulnerabilities?

Not at this time - to give customers a chance to upgrade, we are not releasing further details about these vulnerabilities.

Trend Micro have also advised they will disclose further information (TBD) about the vulnerability on 10th May 2023. For more information, see [<https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/>](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/) (filter on “PaperCut”).

CISA have published an [Advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/05/11/cisa-and-fbi-release-joint-advisory-response-active-exploitation-papercut-vulnerability) with additional information on 11th May 2023.

Q If we can’t upgrade to security patch, what other options are there?

Particularly if you have an older application version that doesn’t have a minor patch available, we highly recommend locking down network access to the server(s).

* Block all inbound traffic from external IPs to the web management port (port 9191 and 9192 by default)
* Block all traffic inbound to the web management portal on the firewall to the server. Note: this will prevent lateral movement from internal hosts but management of the PaperCut service can only be performed on that asset.
* Apply “Allow list” restrictions under Options > Advanced > Security > Allowed site server IP addresses. Set this to only allow the IP addresses of verified Site Servers on your network. Note this only addresses ZDI-CAN-19226 / PO-1219

Q How do I know if my server has been exploited?

We currently recommend looking for the following Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to determine if it is likely that the vulnerability has been used to install malware on the system. Depending on your systems, logging and endpoint protection software you may be able to detect the following.

* If you see suspicious activity or security alerts in Antivirus, anti-malware and endpoint security software tooling.
* If you see suspicious PaperCut MF application log entries, ie:

  + User “admin” logs into the administration interface
  + Admin user “admin” modified the print script on the printer
  + User “admin” updated the config key “…” (where the config key is not one you’ve deliberately changed)
  + User “[setup-wizard]” modified a config key
  + If your Application Server server logs happen to be in debug mode, check to see if there are lines mentioning `SetupCompleted` at a time not correlating with the server installation or upgrade. Server logs can be found e.g. in `[app-path]/server/logs/*.*` where `server.log` is normally the most recent log file.

Additional context on the IoC may also be found in the [CISA Advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/05/11/cisa-and-fbi-release-joint-advisory-response-active-exploitation-papercut-vulnerability).

If you suspect that your server has been compromised, we recommend taking server backups, then wiping the Application Server, and rebuilding the Application Server and restoring the database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior. In addition we recommend you implement your security response procedures and carry out best practices around potential compromise. Also see the “How do I retain my data when restoring my Application Server?” question below.

We will update this question with more details as we find more information from our customer base and security community.

Q How do I retain my data when restoring my Application Server?

Depending on how far back you need to restore your backup from, you may want to restore balances or other data changes in the gap between the last safe backup, and now.

There’s some options for the restore process and subsequent data retention below:

1. Restore App Server and Database to a clean backup (**Recommended option**)

   * This would involve restoring the Application Server and database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior.
   * If you don’t require the data changes between the safe backup and now, you’re all set.
2. Restore App Server and Database, then update user balances (**Safe option**)

   * To restore recent user balances, we recommend restoring the latest (current) database backup containing all of the latest data, onto a staging machine that’s running a patched version of the Application Server, and is not connected to the network. You can then use this environment to export your user balances, and then import them into the production (restored) system.
   * To export user balance / user credit data from your off-network system, run a user report - e.g. in the PaperCut MF/NG admin interface, head to **Reports > User > User reports > User list** then select the **CSV** report format. This will generate a list of your users and their current balances.
   * Then use the detailed information on the [Batch import and update user data](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/applicationserver/user-import-update/) article to format the data into the correct columns, then import/update the data in your production system.
3. Restore App Server, and retain your most recent database

   * If you need to keep all your reporting data as well as user balance data and other changes to the database, you will need to manually clean a copy of your potentially compromised database.
   * We recommend restoring the latest (current) database backup containing all of the latest data, onto a staging machine that’s running a patched version of the Application Server, and is not connected to the network.
   * On that system, ensure that you clean/check the following:
     + Set config key [print-and-device.script.enabled](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to N (if you’re not using print or device scripting)
     + Set config key [device.script.sandboxed](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to Y (the recommended default)
     + Set config key [print.script.sandboxed](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to Y (the recommended default)
     + Delete any [device scripts](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/script-device-create/) or [print scripts](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/script-create/) which have been configured, in case they have been tampered with.
     + Ensure that your user lists and other PaperCut MF/NG settings match with what you expect to see in your environment.
   * Once you are confident that the staging machine settings are clean, perform a database export from the staging environment, then import that cleaned database data into the production environment.

Q Is there a maintenance release for versions 19 or older?

No - versions 19 and older are now “end of life”, as documented on our [End of Life Policy](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EndOfLifePolicy) page.

We recommend purchasing an updated license, which you can do [online if you’re using PaperCut NG](https://www.papercut.com/buy/), or [through your PaperCut Partner](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/how-to-get/) if you’re using PaperCut MF. You can find your PaperCut Partner contact information through the ‘About’ or ‘Help’ tab in the PaperCut administration interface.

Q I have a version 20 license, but no current M&S (maintenance and support) - can I still get this fix?

Yes! As long as you are running a version which is currently supported (version 20 or later) you can upgrade to whichever maintenance release version you’re licensed for. For example if you are licensed for version 20 but you don’t have a valid license for version 21, you can update to version 20.1.7 as above. See the ‘Where can I get the upgrade?’ question above for more details.

See our [Upgrade Policy](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/UpgradePolicy) page for more information on licensing and upgrades.

In this bulletin we cover the security improvements addressed in PaperCut NG/MF **version 22.1.1**. If you’re upgrading, please also review the [upgrade checklist](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/22-1-1-upgrade-checklist).

This page will continue to be updated as new information becomes available. Last updated: 22 August 14:00 AEST.

info

For other Security vulnerability and Security bulletin information, see our [Security vulnerability information and common security questions](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/CommonSecurityQuestions/) page.
## Executive Summary / tl;dr

We have released the first in a series of security hardening updates for PaperCut NG/MF. The majority of improvements focus on preemptively reducing the attack surface and adding layers of security defense.

PaperCut Software would like to thank the external research community, many of whom have lent in over the past month or so to help harden PaperCut NG/MF, given the current security environment. This release takes inputs from internal application security architecture reviews, ongoing penetration testing, and security auditing conducted by internal and external researchers.

We recommend all customers upgrade to this release.

## Security hardening measures

The 22.1.1 release contains security hardening features designed to uplift default security and provide additional layers of protection. In particular, we’ve added configuration and new defaults to make it hard for attackers to initiate a chained attack using PaperCut NG/MF.

These include the introduction of a new `security.properties` file to separate the configuration of some components from the web administration interface. These include:

* Print Scripting and Device Scripting settings, such as the ability to run executables and unsafe code from scripts
* Explicit granting of permission to run external executables such as those used with custom authentication providers and other plugins

For the vast majority of customers, no action will be required after the upgrade. Customers who are using scripting features may have additional configuration steps, which are outlined in the [upgrade checklist](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/22-1-1-upgrade-checklist).

Release notes are available at the following pages:

* [Version 22.1.1 release notes (MF)](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/release-history/22-1/#v22-1-1)
* [Version 22.1.1 release notes (NG)](https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/release-history/22-1/#v22-1-1)

Please note that these security hardening measures also resolve a ‘chained’ vulnerability that Trend Micro subsequently raised as CVE-2023-39469 (also known as ZDI-CAN-20965) which references the ability to configure scripts to call executables once you have gained admin access to PaperCut MF/NG. As above, this is [**fixed** **in version 22.1.1**](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/release-history/22-1/#v22-1-1) as part of the “Introduced security hardening layer through security.properties file” changes. The vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of **6.5**: ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:X](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:X&amp;version=3.1)).

## CVEs addressed

This release also addresses two recently identified vulnerabilities reported by security researchers:

* CVE-2023-31046
* CVE-2023-2533
* CVE-2023-39469 (see security hardening measures, above)

PaperCut Software would like to thank the external research community, many of whom have lent in over the past month or so to help harden PaperCut NG/MF, given the current security environment. We’d like to specifically thank Chris McCurley at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) and Carlos Andrés Bello at [Fluid Attacks](https://fluidattacks.com) for their recent efforts in identifying and reporting these to us.

### CVE-2023-31046 - Path Traversal vulnerability

A Path Traversal vulnerability has been identified in our Application Server and Site Server. Under specific conditions, this could potentially allow an attacker read-only access to the server’s file system.

Recommendation: Upgrade to PaperCut NG/MF version 22.1.1 or later.

This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of **7.2**: ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)).

*Note: Aura Information Security subsequently published an [additional disclosure on their website](https://research.aurainfosec.io/disclosure/papercut/) in August 2023.*

### CVE-2023-2533 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in PaperCut NG/MF, which, under specific conditions, could potentially enable an attacker to alter security settings or execute arbitrary code. This could be exploited if the target is an admin with a current login session. Exploiting this would typically involve the possibility of deceiving an admin into clicking a specially crafted malicious link, potentially leading to unauthorized changes.

Recommendation: Upgrade to PaperCut NG/MF version 22.1.1 or later.

This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of **7.9**: ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H&version=3.1)).
