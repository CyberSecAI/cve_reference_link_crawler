```
{
  "CVE-2023-31046": {
    "Root cause": "The application server defines a servlet that can be accessed with authentication, allowing a crafted HTTP request to retrieve files. The `static-content-files` servlet in `web.xml` uses the `getResourceAsFile()` function in `UIContentResource.class`, which takes a user-controlled `@PathParam(\"asset\")` without sanitization. This allows directory traversal using `..//` sequences.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Inadequate Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the filesystem that the PaperCut server has access to, potentially including API keys and sensitive data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted HTTP GET request to the `/ui/static/` endpoint with directory traversal sequences in the `asset` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the lowest level of authentication available."
  }
