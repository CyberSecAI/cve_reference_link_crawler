Skip creating external textures that exceeds size limitSkia always accept an Android buffer and wraps it around with a textureeven if its size exceeds the limit GL exposes. Therefore let's skipcreating the texture in SurfaceFlinger and outputs an error log tologcat.I chose to do it in SurfaceFlinger rather than RenderEngine is becausethe external texture mapping is designed to be asynchronous, so it'd bebetter to keep that way. The limit is also exposed out of RenderEngineso SurfaceFlinger can check it before creating external textures aswell.Bug: 190399306Bug: 204316511Test: The test mentioned in the bug fails instead of crashingSurfaceFlinger.Test: atest SurfaceFlinger\_testTest: atest libsurfaceflinger\_unittestChange-Id: I52d253ed5a10f0e4ade372048721913405ed668a(cherry picked from commit 9c9c19134593655c36fe70aaa45a91ad4f75e36f)Merged-In: I52d253ed5a10f0e4ade372048721913405ed668a
