- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Android version of Collabora Office fails to properly sanitize URL encoded values in links within documents. This allows for the injection of JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation of URL encoded values in links, leading to JavaScript injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of the application due to the Android JavaScript interface allowing access to internal functions.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted documents containing specially crafted links with JavaScript within URL encoded values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or modify documents that are opened in the affected version of Collabora Office on Android.
