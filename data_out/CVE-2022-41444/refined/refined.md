{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when processing user-supplied data, specifically within the `graphs_new.php` script. The application takes user input from a POST request, extracts a value based on the `sgg_` prefix, and processes it without proper escaping. This unfiltered user input is then passed to `die_html_input_error`, which then prints it on the page, leading to XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This injected code can then be executed in the browser of other users, leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request containing a parameter with a name starting with `sgg_` and a malicious script in its value. This request would be sent to the `graphs_new.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Cacti instance and must be able to manipulate the `sgg_` parameter."
