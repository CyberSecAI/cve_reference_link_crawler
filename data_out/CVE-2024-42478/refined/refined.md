Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an unsafe `data` pointer within the `rpc_tensor` structure. This pointer, controlled by the user, is later used in a `memcpy` operation within the `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_get_tensor` function.  Specifically, the `data` member of the `rpc_tensor` structure is used as the source address for a memcpy, without proper validation of its bounds, which can result in arbitrary memory reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Address Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary memory locations by manipulating the `data` pointer within the `rpc_tensor` structure.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to adequately validate the user-controlled `data` pointer before using it in the `memcpy` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive data from arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** This arbitrary read primitive can be combined with other vulnerabilities, such as an arbitrary write, to achieve more severe impacts, like remote code execution (RCE), as demonstrated in the provided materials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based through the RPC server, which listens for incoming connections.
*   **Remote Client:** A malicious client can connect to the vulnerable RPC server and send crafted requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target machine running the vulnerable `rpc-server`.
*   **RPC Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the RPC protocol used by the server to craft malicious requests.
*  **Control over rpc_tensor structure:** The attacker must be able to control the data within the `rpc_tensor` structure, particularly the `data` pointer.
*   **Ability to send messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages using the RPC protocol.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in `rpc_server::get_tensor` which leads to `ggml_backend_tensor_get`, and eventually to `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_get_tensor`.
*   The `rpc_tensor` structure contains a `data` pointer that can be manipulated by the user.
*   The vulnerable code uses `memcpy` with the user-controlled `data` pointer as the source address, without proper bounds checking.
* The commit b72942f introduced checks to prevent the out-of-bounds read, but versions prior to this commit are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
* The vulnerability was discovered by 7resp4ss and Guang Gong from 360 Vulnerability Research Institute.
* The fix for the vulnerability is in commit `b72942f` which includes a bounds check for the `tensor->data` pointer, preventing the arbitrary read. Versions prior to this are vulnerable.
