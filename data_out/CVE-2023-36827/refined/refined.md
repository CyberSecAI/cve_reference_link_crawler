Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-36827:

**Root Cause:**
- A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability exists in the fides webserver API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The API did not properly sanitize user-supplied paths, allowing for the injection of directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers could access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including configuration files and other data stored within the container.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network requests to the fides webserver API. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the server processes a URL path containing directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the fides webserver API.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in fides version 2.15.1 by adding a `sanitise_url_path` function. This function uses `os.path.normpath` to normalize the path and checks for the presence of `..` sequences. If such sequences are found, a `MalisciousUrlException` is raised, and the request is redirected to the index page, preventing file access.
- The fix includes test cases that verify the sanitization of various path traversal attempts.
- It's also mentioned that if the Fides webserver API is behind a reverse proxy, specifically an AWS application load balancer, the load balancer can mitigate this vulnerability by rejecting requests with such patterns.
- Secrets provided through environment variables are not affected by this vulnerability.
