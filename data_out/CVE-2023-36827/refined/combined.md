# Path Traversal in Webserver API

High

[daveqnet](/daveqnet)
published
GHSA-r25m-cr6v-p9hq
Jul 5, 2023

## Package

pip

ethyca-fides
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.15.1

## Patched versions

2.15.1

## Description

### Impact

A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem.

### Patches

The vulnerability is patched in fides `2.15.1`. Users should upgrade to this version.

### Workarounds

If the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's [security best practice documentation](https://docs.ethyca.com/docs/configuration/security-practices#reverse-proxy), and the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer, the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error.

Additionally, any secrets supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-36827
