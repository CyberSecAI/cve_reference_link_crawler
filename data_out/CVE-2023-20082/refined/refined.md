- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Errors occur when retrieving the public release key used for image signature verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of public release key retrieval, which can lead to a secure boot bypass. The vulnerability lies in the Cisco IOS XE ROM Monitor (ROMMON) software.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust, potentially gaining full control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: 
    - An authenticated, local attacker with level-15 privileges can exploit this.
    - An unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device can also exploit this by modifying specific variables in the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Level-15 privileges on the device or physical access to the device.
    - Ability to modify SPI flash memory variables.

The advisory also notes that in Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, the complexity of an attack using this vulnerability is high. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software on a device to a release that would lower the attack complexity.
