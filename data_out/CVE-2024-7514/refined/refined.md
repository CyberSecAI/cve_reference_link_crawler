Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient file path validation within the "WordPress Comments Import & Export" plugin during the CSV comment import process. Specifically, the plugin allows users to specify a file path for import, and it does not properly sanitize or restrict this path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. The plugin doesn't properly validate the provided file path, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory. This enables the reading of arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the contents of any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This can include sensitive configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys, etc.), source code, and other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP request that initiates the comment import process, where a malicious file path is provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with "Author" level access or higher. This means they need to have the ability to create posts and potentially manage comments, depending on the role configuration.
* **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the server's file system in order to specify the paths to sensitive files that they want to read.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `class-hf_cmt_impexpcsv-import.php` file of the plugin.
The code at line 150: `$file = ABSPATH . $this->file_url;` shows how the plugin is constructing the path based on the user-supplied input.
The code at line 354: `$file     = stripslashes( $_POST['file'] );` and line 152 `$file = str_replace("\\", "/", $file);` show that the plugin attempts to sanitize the input path but these sanitization efforts are insufficient to prevent directory traversal.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was partially fixed in version 2.3.8 and fully fixed in 2.3.9
*   The Wordfence article provides a good, clear description of the vulnerability
*   The provided code confirms the location and nature of the vulnerability.
*   The code reveals the logic behind the path construction and how an attacker can specify an arbitrary file path
