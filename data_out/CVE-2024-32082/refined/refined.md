- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Sync Post With Other Site Plugin <= 1.8 lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could result in unauthorized modifications or actions within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation involves tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that executes a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user of the vulnerable plugin to trigger a malicious request. No authentication is required for the attacker themselves to initiate the attack.
