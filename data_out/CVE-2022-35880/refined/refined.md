```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `log` function uses `vsnprintf` with attacker-controlled input, leading to format string vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Format string injection vulnerability in the UPnP logging functionality."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. The output is only visible on the UART console.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious UPnP service can be hosted by an attacker to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and able to send and receive UPnP messages. Additionally, access to the device's UART console is needed to observe the exploit."
