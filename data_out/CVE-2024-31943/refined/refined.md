- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to perform an action (e.g., visit a malicious website or click a manipulated link) that triggers a state change in the vulnerable application without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
