Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44025:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `AddifyfreegiftsModel::getrulebyid()` method of the "Free Gifts" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `$rule_id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the SQL query allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data, potentially compromising the integrity of the PrestaShop store.
- **Availability:**  Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the PrestaShop store, potentially leading to denial of service.
- Specific malicious usages include:
    - Obtaining admin access
    - Removing data from the PrestaShop database
    - Copying sensitive data to the frontend, exposing tokens, and unlocking admin Ajax scripts.
    - Rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks through HTTP requests.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a PrestaShop front controller, making it difficult to detect in standard frontend logs.  Attackers can conceal the module controllerâ€™s path; conventional frontend logs will only show "POST /"

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privilege is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker does not need admin privileges.
- No user interaction is needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the module "Free Gifts" (addifyfreegifts) versions up to 1.0.2.
- The fix involves casting the `$id_rule` parameter to an integer before using it in the SQL query: `(int) $id_rule`.
- The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest version of the module, upgrading PrestaShop itself, changing the default database prefix, and activating OWASP 942's rules on the WAF.
