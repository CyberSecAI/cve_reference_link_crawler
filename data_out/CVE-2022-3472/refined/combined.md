| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability was found in [SourceCodester Human Resource Management System](?product.sourcecodester:human_resource_management_system) ([affected version not known](?kb.version)). It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file *city.php*. The manipulation of the argument `cityedit` with an unknown input leads to a sql injection vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-89](?vulnerability_cwe.210716 "Cwe"). The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The weakness was released 10/12/2022. The advisory is shared for download at [github.com](?advisory_url.210716). This vulnerability is handled as [CVE-2022-3472](?source_cve.210716 "Cve"). Technical details as well as a public exploit are known. The MITRE ATT&CK project declares the attack technique as [T1505](?vulnerability_attck.210716 "Attck").

The exploit is available at [github.com](?exploit_url.210716). It is declared as proof-of-concept. By approaching the search of [inurl:city.php](?exploit_googlehack.210716) it is possible to find vulnerable targets with Google Hacking.

There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.

Entries connected to this vulnerability are available at [VDB-110645](?id.110645) and [VDB-210715](?id.210715).
