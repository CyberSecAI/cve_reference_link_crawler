- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, specifically via the `cityedit` parameter in the `city.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89), potentially also CWE-74 and CWE-707
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially achieve confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact by manipulating the SQL queries to extract sensitive information, modify database records, or disrupt the database service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, via HTTP requests to the `city.php` file, specifically manipulating the `cityedit` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and manipulate the `cityedit` parameter. No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite, indicating it may be unauthenticated.
