{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track bounds information for 32-bit registers when performing div and mod operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds tracking of 32-bit registers during division and modulo operations in eBPF."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A local attacker could craft a malicious eBPF program that leverages the incorrect bounds tracking to perform out-of-bounds operations."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to load and execute eBPF programs on the target system."
