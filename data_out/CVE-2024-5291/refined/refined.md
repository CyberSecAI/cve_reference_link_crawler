- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can send malicious requests to the SOAP API interface on TCP port 80.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment as the D-Link DIR-2150 router. Authentication is not required.
