`[Only check for errors in predicate when skipping impl assembly](/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/70a61c97cbc8375432b16482f127d45b08054951 "Only check for errors in predicate when skipping impl assembly

Prior to PR #91205, checking for errors in the overall obligation
would check checking the `ParamEnv`, due to an incorrect
`super_visit_with` impl. With this bug fixed, we will now
bail out of impl candidate assembly if the `ParamEnv` contains
any error types.

In practice, this appears to be overly conservative - when an error
occurs early in compilation, we end up giving up early for some
predicates that we could have successfully evaluated without overflow.
By only checking for errors in the predicate itself, we avoid causing
additional spurious 'type annotations needed' errors after a 'real'
error has already occurred.

With this PR, the diagnostic changes caused by PR #91205 are reverted.")`

This seems like a breaking change since it lacks loop detection? A sufficiently deep directory tree should return ELOOP or ENAMETOOLONG, but the kernel can't do that for us if we're using `openat`. Instead of returning an error it would result stack overflow panics.

I already had a PR open for openat-based remove\_dir\_all ([#88731](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88731)) that does loop detection.

Sorry, something went wrong.

There should be no loops. Bind mounts on Linux and directory hardlinks (available for Macos only) are not allowed to loop and we are not descending into symlinked dirs because we open them with `openat(..., O_NOFOLLOW)`.

I thought I have managed to introduce loops with bind mounts or overlayfs in the past. But let me check again.

And FUSE might be another option.
