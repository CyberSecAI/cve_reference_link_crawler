# Race condition in std::fs::remove\_dir\_all

High

GHSA-r9cc-f5pr-p3j2
Jan 20, 2022

## Package

cargo

std
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 1.58.0

## Patched versions

1.58.1

## Description

> This is a cross-post [of the official security advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/R1fZFDhnJVQ). The official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.

The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all`

standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink

following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a

privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't

otherwise access or delete.

This issue has been assigned [CVE-2022-21658](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21658).

## Overview

Let's suppose an attacker obtained unprivileged access to a system and needed

to delete a system directory called `sensitive/`, but they didn't have the

permissions to do so. If `std::fs::remove_dir_all` followed symbolic links,

they could find a privileged program that removes a directory they have access

to (called `temp/`), create a symlink from `temp/foo` to `sensitive/`, and wait

for the privileged program to delete `foo/`. The privileged program would

follow the symlink from `temp/foo` to `sensitive/` while recursively deleting,

resulting in `sensitive/` being deleted.

To prevent such attacks, `std::fs::remove_dir_all` already includes protection

to avoid recursively deleting symlinks, as described in its documentation:

> This function does **not** follow symbolic links and it will simply remove
>
> the symbolic link itself.

Unfortunately that check was implemented incorrectly in the standard library,

resulting in a TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) race condition. Instead of

telling the system not to follow symlinks, the standard library first checked

whether the thing it was about to delete was a symlink, and otherwise it would

proceed to recursively delete the directory.

This exposed a race condition: an attacker could create a directory and replace

it with a symlink between the check and the actual deletion. While this attack

likely won't work the first time it's attempted, in our experimentation we were

able to reliably perform it within a couple of seconds.

## Affected Versions

Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability. We're going

to release Rust 1.58.1 later today, which will include mitigations for this

vulnerability. Patches to the Rust standard library are also available for

custom-built Rust toolchains [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/master/patches/CVE-2022-21658).

Note that the following targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the

attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain:

* macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite)
* REDOX

## Mitigations

We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially

people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including

system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being

affected by this.

Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling `remove_dir_all` will

**not** mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race

conditions like `remove_dir_all` itself. The existing mitigation is working as

intended outside of race conditions.

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank Hans Kratz for independently discovering and disclosing this

issue to us according to the [Rust security policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security), for developing the fix

for UNIX-like targets and for reviewing fixes for other platforms.

We also want to thank Florian Weimer for reviewing the UNIX-like fix and for

reporting the same issue back in 2018, even though the Security Response WG

didn't realize the severity of the issue at the time.

Finally we want to thank Pietro Albini for coordinating the security response

and writing this advisory, Chris Denton for writing the Windows fix, Alex

Crichton for writing the WASI fix, and Mara Bos for reviewing the patches.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
