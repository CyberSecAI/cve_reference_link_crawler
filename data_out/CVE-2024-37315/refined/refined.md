Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks in the Nextcloud `files_versions` app. Specifically, read-only users were able to restore older versions of files, even when they lacked the necessary permissions to do so on the current version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The core issue is that the system didn't adequately verify user permissions before allowing a file version to be restored. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
*   **Inadequate Share Status Checks:** The system failed to check the share status correctly, allowing users with read-only access to bypass restrictions related to version control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Integrity Violation:** An attacker could revert a file to an older version, potentially causing data loss or corruption. This is a violation of data integrity, even though there is no confidentiality breach.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** While the attacker doesn't gain write access to the current file version, they effectively modify the file's state by restoring an older version, which could overwrite recent changes from other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is exploitable over the network.
*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with at least read-only access to a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Read-Only Access:** The attacker needs an account with read-only privileges to a file.
*   **`files_versions` App Enabled:** The `files_versions` app must be enabled on the Nextcloud instance.
*   **User interaction**: User interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by implementing checks for share attributes when downloading, restoring, deleting, and labeling versions. This ensures that a user has the necessary permissions to perform these operations on older versions of a document, as well as the current version of the document.
*   The fix was implemented in a series of commits, addressing different aspects of the versioning functionality.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of both Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server. Patches are available for all affected versions.
