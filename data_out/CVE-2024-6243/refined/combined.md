## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# HTML Forms < 1.3.33 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape the form message inputs, allowing high-privilege users, such as administrators, to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disabled.

### Proof of Concept

Add this success message in the Messages section of the form, so when a user submits the form and hovers over the 'Thank you!' message, the JavaScript code will be executed:
<a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)" href="#">Thank you !</a>
