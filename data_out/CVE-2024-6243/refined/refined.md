- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTML Forms plugin fails to sanitize and escape form message inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a form. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrator privileges can insert malicious JavaScript code within the form message settings. This code is then triggered when a user interacts with the affected element in the form, such as hovering over a "thank you" message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least administrative privileges to modify form settings and insert the malicious code.
