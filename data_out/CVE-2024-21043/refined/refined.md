{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in a LOV (List of Values) component within Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied inputs in LOV components. This allows attackers to potentially inject malicious data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to data or to manipulate the application's behavior. The impact is listed as low for confidentiality and integrity, but no impact on availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is conducted over HTTP by injecting crafted data into the LOV component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have network access to the application and be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests. User interaction is required, implying that an authenticated user may be required to perform the attack."
