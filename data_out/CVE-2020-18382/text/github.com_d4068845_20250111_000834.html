### **[wcventure](/wcventure)** commented [Feb 6, 2019](#issue-407112198)

| Hi, there.  A Heap-buffer-overflow problem was discovered in wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::visitBlock(wasm::Block\*) function in simple\_ast.h in /src/wasm/wasm-binary.cpp, as distributed in Binaryen 1.38.26. A crafted wasm input can cause segment faults and I have confirmed them with address sanitizer too.  Here are the POC files. Please use "./wasm-opt $POC" to reproduce the error. [POC.zip](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/files/2835276/POC.zip)  git log  ``` commit 153ba18ba99dc4dcef29a61e1e586af3df8d921d (HEAD -> master, tag: version_65, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Author: Alon Zakai <alonzakai@gmail.com> Date:   Mon Jan 28 11:32:19 2019 -0800      Handle EM_ASM/EM_JS in LLVM wasm backend O0 output (#1888)      See emscripten-core/emscripten#7928 - we have been optimizing all wasms until now, and noticed this when the wasm object file path did not do so. When not optimizing, our methods of handling EM_ASM and EM_JS fail since the patterns are different.      Specifically, for EM_ASM we hunt for emscripten_asm_const(X, where X is a constant, but without opts it may be a get of a local. For EM_JS, the function body may not just contain a const, but a block with a set of the const and a return of a get later.      This adds logic to track gets and sets in basic blocks, which is sufficient to handle this.  ```  The ASAN dumps the stack trace as follows:  ```

| Since MITRE was the assigning CNA, either they have started a major shift in how they aggregate vulnerabilities, or a third-party had an interest in this issue and requested an ID. |

| I see, thanks [@nickthetait](https://github.com/nickthetait) [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg)  I am curious about this because I am not aware of usage of Binaryen in places where this type of thing could be an issue. We fuzz heavily for correctness issues (optimization bugs), but we don't tune our fuzzer on parser DOSes like this. Basically in all the use cases I'm aware of, Binaryen is run on a user's own code, on their own machine (and can be run in a sandbox to boot).  So I'd be very curious to know if there are cases where DOSes and such do matter, because if so we could raise the priority on them. But it sounds like there's nothing public about that currently. |

| If you (collectively, the project) feel that this is not a valid vulnerability, or one that would only manifest in absurd conditions, you can a) document the bug in some fashion as a known issue, "won't fix", b) appeal the assignment which will move it to DISPUTED status, so anyone using the CVE ecosystem would see the vendor does not agree with it c) provide more context to make the entry more accurate by clarifying details, affected versions, etc. d) a combination of the prior.  That said, MITRE is not reliable on taking external feedback at times but has been more responsive as late, and they tend to be when the vendor contacts them. As far as the impact, the vuln intel shop I work at has fairly set definitions of these cases. If the result is just a crash with no benefit to an attacker, then it is "NAV" (Not A Vulnerability) to us and considered a stability crash. If there is a benefit for an attacker, we want to qualify what the impact really is, what the exploit conditions are, etc. Those allow us to provide more accurate risk scoring metrics and caveats so companies can respond accordingly. Some may accept risk and move on, some may want a patch (often for compliance reasons as much as anything). |

| To be clear, I do 100% agree this is a valid vulnerability, and so we fixed it, and we'll fix any others like it that are found. Though I don't know how dangerous it is (such as whether an attacker can benefit from it) because that's not my area of expertise.  I also believe it can matter in certain situations. But I am just not aware of actual users using it in such situations, which is what I'm curious about. If I knew of such users then I would spend time on making our fuzzer focus more on this type of issue than it currently does. Right now our fuzzer focuses a lot more on other things (optimizer correctness issues, and finding bugs in Wasm VMs). |
