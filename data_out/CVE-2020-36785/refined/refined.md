The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free and double-free in the `atomisp_alloc_css_stat_bufs` function within the Linux kernel's media subsystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The `s3a_buf` is freed along with other items on the `asd->s3a_stats` list, but it might still be used later in the function under certain error conditions.
- Double-free: If memory allocation for `dis_buf` fails, the code attempts to free `s3a_buf`, which might have been freed already.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash (kernel panic) and potentially other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered when allocating CSS statistic buffers in the `atomisp_alloc_css_stat_bufs` function, possibly by a crafted ioctl.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to interact with the AtomISP driver, likely requiring a user with sufficient privileges to access the device or trigger specific ioctl calls to trigger this condition.
