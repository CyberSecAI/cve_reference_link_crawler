- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected applications contain configuration files that can be modified.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Hidden functionality (CWE-912).  The vulnerability arises from the ability to modify configuration files, enabling features not intended for the device.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with privileged access can modify these files, enabling unintended functionality, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs privileged access to the system to modify the configuration files.
