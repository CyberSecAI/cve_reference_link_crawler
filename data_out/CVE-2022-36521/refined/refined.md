The provided content is related to CVE-2022-36521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/addAdmin` endpoint lacks proper authentication and authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to create administrator accounts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The `addAdmin` method does not verify if the user is logged in before creating a new administrator.
- **Missing Authorization:** There are no checks to confirm if the user is authorized to perform the administrator creation action.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users can create administrator accounts, potentially gaining full control of the application and accessing sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/addAdmin` endpoint with the desired username, password, email, mobile, and superadmin flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges. They only need network access to the vulnerable application.
