- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Content - Name" field of the Pages menu allows injection of JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before storing them in the database and rendering them in the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "Content-Name" field in the Pages menu of the Quick CMS 6.7 admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged into the Quick CMS admin panel to inject the malicious code. The attacker also requires the ability to create or modify entries in the Pages menu.
