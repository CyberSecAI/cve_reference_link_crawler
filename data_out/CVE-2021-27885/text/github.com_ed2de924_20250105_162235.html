[v2.3.1](/e107inc/e107/releases/tag/v2.3.1)

## Highlights

* **Support for PHP 5.6 through PHP 8.1** ([#4554](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4554)) – e107 v2 now adds PHP 8.0 and 8.1 support while maintaining support for PHP 5.6.
* **New Admin Theme Skins** – *Modern Light* and *Modern Dark*. May now be selected during initial installation of e107.
* **Collapsible Navigation Panel** – Option to reduce left-panel admin area navigation to icons only, for increased screen real-estate where it matters.
* **Database session handler performance improvement** ([#4575](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4575)) – e107 v2.3.0 introduced a non-blocking session handler backed by the database; however, a missing index causes gradually slower performance the more rows there are in the session table. This release fixes that bug by adding the missing index through a database update (migration).
* **Thumbnail Generator** rebuilt to use Intervention library.
* **WebP image support** ([#4270](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4270)) – e107 can now serve WebP images to compatible browsers and convert existing images on-the-fly. Requires PHP 7.0+ with [the GD WebP extension installed](https://www.php.net/manual/en/image.installation.php).
* **More reliable file uploads** – A common complaint with e107 v2.3.0 was rejected file uploads. To fix this, e107 now recognizes files based on their MIME type.
* **Increased protection against cross-site scripting (XSS)** – There is now improved layering of HTML tag rendering to reduce the likelihood of corrupting pages with bad HTML.
* **Increased protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)** – Nonces have been added to some forms to prevent external sites from submitting them unbeknown to the authenticated user.
* **New theming features** – Theme developers can now take advantage of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and customisable breadcrumbs.
* **SEO optimizations** for Google, Facebook (Open Graph) and Twitter.
* **New "Hero" plugin** for home page carousel management. Supports animated bullet points and buttons. (see e107.org home page for example)
* **News item Previous/Next navigation** shortcode options.
* **jQuery updated** to v3.6.0
* **FontAwesome updated** to v5.14.0

[v2.3.0](/e107inc/e107/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

## Highlights

* **Support for PHP 5.6 through PHP 7.4** – e107 v2 now adds PHP 7.4 support while maintaining support for PHP 5.6. Note that PHP 8.0 support is not yet available but will be added in a future release (after [#4269](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4269)).
* **Support for MySQL 8.0** ([#4216](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4216)) – Database integrity checks no longer persist their warnings on MySQL 8.0. MySQL 5.5 through MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.0 through MariaDB 10.5 remain supported.
* **New session handler with improved performance** ([#4113](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4113)) – Non-blocking session handler backed by the database allows multiple concurrent requests to the e107 site per user session. A site administrator can enable this session handler at [Settings » Preferences » Advanced Options » Security & Protection » Session Save Method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1364268/100519179-e8a75f00-315b-11eb-9978-8aa8d603fc71.png) and setting the value to "Database". New installations will use the database session handler by default.
* **More social login providers** ([#3492](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3492)) – The full list of supported social login providers can be found [here](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/tree/v2.3.0/e107_handlers/vendor/hybridauth/hybridauth/src/Provider).
* **Code quality improvements** – Automated tests are being introduced to reduce the chance of future changes breaking intended behavior.
* **Many bugfixes** – A ton of issues have been fixed both in the frontend and in the Admin-UI. Details about most of them can be found below.

## For Administrators

### Added

* New session handler for the `session` user tracking method: Database storage. Improves performance for concurrent requests in a session.
* Option to allow users to delete their own accounts ([#4065](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4065))
* Updated social login providers ([#3492](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3492))
* Basic per-item search engine robots handling added to News and Pages
* Support for automated Git sync with a theme repo
* Theme preferences import/export added to 'database' admin area.
* New admin permission to grant access to the theme manager
* Approve all comments has been added as an option.
* Added Rich Textarea (WYSIYWG) for EUF ([#1775](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/1775))
* Support for hosting providers that disable PHP `readfile()` ([#3528](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3528))
* A PHP module check (similar to the one during installation) has been added to the PHPInfo page to quickly detect any missing modules after one migrates e107 to another PHP configuration.
* download plugin:
  + Added `$host` variable support to Downloads » Protection » NGINX secure\_link\_md5 ([#4010](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4010))
* forum plugin:
  + Added minimal validation when creating new forum
  + Added new 'Forum icon' field ([#3733](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3733))
  + Added confirmation dialog when deleting forum topic or post ([#718](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/718))
  + Added cache for new forum posts menu

### Changed

* The default user tracking method for new installations has been changed to `session` (was `cookie`). The `cookie` user tracking method is expected to be removed in a future release.
* The database handler PDO is now used by default. mysqli is available as a fallback.
* The social login flow has changed substantially. ([#4099](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4099))
  + `?route=system/xup/signup` was removed because `?route=system/xup/login` now signs up and logs in via social login.
  + The return URL (query `back`) is no longer base64-encoded.
  + Some provider names have changed because the library (Hybridauth) has renamed them. These changes are accounted for in a database migration.
  + `signup_shortcodes` generates login buttons somewhat differently now.
  + The page `?route=system/xup/test` is no longer enabled by default.
* The core integrity image (previously `./e107_admin/core_image.php`, now `./e107_system/core_image.phar`) has a new backwards-incompatible format. As it is now a binary file, administrators upgrading e107 over FTP should ensure that they are using binary transfer mode. ([Issue reference](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4114#commitcomment-38134217))
  + Before: PHP array stored in a global variable
  + Now: JSON compressed into a phar
* Set initial value for email hide setting as TRUE when creating new user ([#4107](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4107))
* Enable PHP session file garbage collection if it is not already enabled ([#4113](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4113))

* "Update `./e107_core/bbcodes/bb_p.php`" ([#3988](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/3988))
* Admin-UI: Display ID number in create/update message
* Allow semicolons in URL query string ([#3943](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3943))
* Allow `<a rel>` ([#4128](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4128))
* Default access to `post_script` changed from Main Admin to Nobody

Pre-release

## For Administrators

### Added

* Option to allow users to delete their own accounts ([#4065](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4065))
* Updated social login providers ([#3492](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3492))
* Basic per-item search engine robots handling added to News and Pages
* Support for automated Git sync with a theme repo
* Theme preferences import/export added to 'database' admin area.
* New admin permission to grant access to the theme manager
* Approve all comments has been added as an option.
* Added Rich Textarea (WYSIYWG) for EUF ([#1775](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/1775))
* Support for hosting providers that disable PHP `readfile()` ([#3528](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/3528))
* A PHP module check (similar to the one during installation) has been added to the PHPInfo page to quickly detect any missing modules after one migrates e107 to another PHP configuration.
* download plugin:
  + Added `$host` variable support to Downloads » Protection » NGINX secure\_link\_md5 ([#4010](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4010))
* forum plugin:
  + Added minimal validation when creating new forum

  + Added confirmation dialog when deleting forum topic or post ([#718](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/718))
  + Added cache for new forum posts menu

### Changed

* The default user tracking method for new installations has been changed to `session` (was `cookie`). The `cookie` user tracking method is expected to be removed in a future release.
* The database handler PDO is now used by default. mysqli is available as a fallback.
* The social login flow has changed substantially. ([#4099](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4099))
  + `?route=system/xup/signup` was removed because `?route=system/xup/login` now signs up and logs in via social login.
  + The return URL (query `back`) is no longer base64-encoded.
  + Some provider names have changed because the library (Hybridauth) has renamed them. These changes are accounted for in a database migration.
  + `signup_shortcodes` generates login buttons somewhat differently now.
  + The page `?route=system/xup/test` is no longer enabled by default.
* The core integrity image (previously `./e107_admin/core_image.php`, now `./e107_system/core_image.phar`) has a new backwards-incompatible format. As it is now a binary file, administrators upgrading e107 over FTP should ensure that they are using binary transfer mode. ([Issue reference](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4114#commitcomment-38134217))
  + Before: PHP array stored in a global variable
  + Now: JSON compressed into a phar
* Set initial value for email hide setting as TRUE when creating new user ([#4107](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4107))
* Enable PHP session file garbage collection if it is not already enabled ([#4113](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues/4113))

* Removed obsolete `ALLOW_AUTO_FIELD_DEFS` constant
* Clear system cache after running Git pull or sync.
* Partial rewrite of `./e107_admin/fileinspector.php` ([#4114](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/pull/4114))
