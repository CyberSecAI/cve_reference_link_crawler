- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `diagnose system geoip-city` CLI command when a large IP address value is provided.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Attack vectors:** Executing the `diagnose system geoip-city` command via the CLI with an overly large IP address value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated, local attacker with CLI access to the affected FortiAnalyzer or FortiManager device is required.
