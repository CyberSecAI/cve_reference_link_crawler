Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability present in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The code reads user-provided input for the `ssid` parameter into a buffer (`src`) and then copies this data to a smaller stack-based buffer (`s`) using `strcpy` without performing any length check. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `ssid` parameter is longer than the buffer `s`, overwriting other data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing an overly long string for the `ssid` parameter, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow and cause the router to crash. This effectively leads to a DoS attack, disrupting the router's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` page of the router. The malicious payload is sent within the `ssid` parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the router. This could be either local access or remote access if the router's administration interface is exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have the ability to send HTTP requests to the router.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Knowledge of how to send HTTP GET requests is required.
- **No Authentication Required (Inferred):** The document does not mention any authentication being required for this specific attack vector. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible to anyone who can reach the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable Router Model:** The attacker needs a Tenda AC18 router running the vulnerable firmware version.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the latest version of the Tenda AC18 Router, specifically [AC18\_V15.03.05.19(6318)](https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2683.html).
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script is provided in Python, which demonstrates how to send a malicious request to cause the DoS.
- The issue was reported to both CVE and CNVD, and CVE-2022-30473 and CNVD-2022-43197 were assigned respectively.
