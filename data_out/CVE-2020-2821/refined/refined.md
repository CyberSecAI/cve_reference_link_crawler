Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve high impact on confidentiality and low impact on integrity of the data. There is no impact on availability according to the risk matrix.  The "Changed" scope implies that a successful exploit affects resources beyond the vulnerable component itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable over a network via the HTTP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the Oracle E-Business Suite instance, and knowledge of the vulnerabilities to be able to carry out the exploit. They must be able to interact with the application through a web browser or a similar client that can send HTTP requests. No special privileges are required on the system to exploit the vulnerability itself.
