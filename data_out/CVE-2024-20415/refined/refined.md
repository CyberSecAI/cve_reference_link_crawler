- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in the affected interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated, remote attacker. The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with crafted input.
