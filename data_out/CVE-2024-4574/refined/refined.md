**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in multiple widgets within the Graphina â€“ Elementor Charts and Graphs plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable widgets of the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
