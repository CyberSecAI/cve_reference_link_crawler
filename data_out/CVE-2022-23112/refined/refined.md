Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-23112:

**CVE-2022-23112**

*   **Root Cause:** The Publish Over SSH Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing connection tests. Also, these connection test methods do not require POST requests, which leads to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks when performing connection tests.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Connection test methods don't require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read access can connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials, which could potentially lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to systems.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can leverage the missing permission check to initiate unauthorized connection tests.
    *   The lack of POST request validation allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that is executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker must be able to craft malicious requests to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected plugin is Publish Over SSH Plugin, version 1.22 and earlier.
*   There was no fix available at the time of the advisory's publication.
*   The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-2290 and CVE-2022-23112 (missing permission check) and CVE-2022-23111 (CSRF).
