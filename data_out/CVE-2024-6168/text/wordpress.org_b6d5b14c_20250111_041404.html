I love Just Custom Fields, Have been using it for many years (starting with version 1) and it has me saved so much time and helped me with getting customized data into my site.
And updating from version 2 to 3 gave me some issues but luckily the developer was quick to respond to my support message and helped me getting it fixed.
If you want some custom fields the this is just the only real option.

After updating to the latest version of this plugin, it removed all of the previous fields. I had to go back to v2.3.
