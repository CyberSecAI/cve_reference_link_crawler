- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Llama Stack used the `pickle` serialization format for socket communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Using `pickle` for deserializing data from untrusted sources is dangerous because it allows arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution is possible.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted `pickle` data sent over the socket connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted data to the vulnerable socket endpoint.
