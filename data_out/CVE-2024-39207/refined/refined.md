Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `lua-shmem` library. Specifically, the `shmem_write` and `shmem_fill` functions in the `shmem.c` source file are affected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The functions `shmem_write` and `shmem_fill` do not check if the size of the data being written exceeds the allocated size of the shared memory buffer (`shmem_ud->memory`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow can occur if the length of data provided to `shmem_write` or `shmem_fill` is greater than the allocated shared memory size.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user of the library calls the `shmem_write` or `shmem_fill` methods with a data string that's larger than the shared memory buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to use the `lua-shmem` library and control the data passed to the `shmem_write` or `shmem_fill` functions.
- The attacker needs to know the size of the shared memory buffer allocated to exploit the vulnerability by providing a larger data.

**Additional details:**
- The affected versions are `lua-shmem` versions `1.0-1` and earlier.
- The provided code snippets demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability.
