{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `mac802154_llsec_key_del()` function in the Linux kernel's mac802154 subsystem could free key resources directly without adhering to RCU (Read-Copy-Update) rules. Specifically, it would delete the key entry from the list and release memory without waiting for a grace period, potentially causing a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur if `llsec_lookup_key()` is simultaneously traversing the list of keys while a key is being deleted. This can lead to system crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to trigger the deletion of an IEEE 802.15.4 security key while another process or kernel operation is accessing the same key. This can be triggered through network communication.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the 802.15.4 network stack and have the ability to add and remove keys. This could be either a local or remote user depending on the system configuration."
  },
  "affected_component": "mac802154 subsystem in the Linux kernel",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-26961"
