Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation of the `userid` parameter in the `/load_data.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize the `userid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example demonstrates extracting the database name. It could be extended to extract other information such as usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data from database tables.
- Data Modification/Deletion: An attacker could potentially modify or delete database records
- Potential Complete System Compromise: In certain setups with a vulnerable database setup, it could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/load_data.php`
- Manipulation of the `userid` parameter within the POST data

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application, specifically `/load_data.php`.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned. This suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Details:**

The provided github issue includes:
- The vulnerable parameter: `userid`
- The vulnerable file `/load_data.php`
- Proof of concept exploit script demonstrating how to extract the database name.
- Screenshots of the vulnerable code and the response.
