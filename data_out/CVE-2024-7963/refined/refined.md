Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the CMSMasters Content Composer plugin's shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input when processing shortcode attributes. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the WordPress database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. When a user accesses an affected page, the injected script executes within their browser.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** The attacker can potentially use the XSS vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users or steal sensitive information such as session cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious code within the attributes of one or more of the plugin's shortcodes.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious shortcode is stored in the database, making the XSS persistent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher Access:**  The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website to create and edit content containing the malicious shortcodes.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the CMSMasters Content Composer plugin up to and including version 1.8.8.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.9.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by István Márton from Wordfence.
