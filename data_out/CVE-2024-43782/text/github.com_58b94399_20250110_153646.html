# Atlas translations for Open edX missing validation

High

[magajh](/magajh)
published
GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j
Aug 23, 2024

## Package

edx-platform
(edx-platform)

## Affected versions

redwood, master

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Before moving to pulling translations from the [`openedx-translations` repository](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations) via [`openedx-atlas`](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-atlas) as described in [OEP-58](https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0058-arch-translations-management.html), translations in the [`edx-platform` repository](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform) were validated using [`edx-i18n-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/edx-i18n-tools/). This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections.

Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the `openedx-translations` repository did not include the same protections.

We have inspected the translations in the `edx-platform` directory of both the `main` and `open-release/redwood.master` branches of the `openedx-translations` repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

We have updated the [`openedx-translations` repository](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations) to utilize [`edx-i18n-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/edx-i18n-tools/) for validation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
