SSA-491245: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

V1.1

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads specially crafted ﬁles in various formats such as X_B, DWG, DXF, STL, STP, SLDPRT
and PAR format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected applications, an attacker
could leverage the vulnerability to crash the application, extract data or potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Do not open untrusted X_B, DWG, DXF, STL, STP, SLDPRT and PAR ﬁles in Solid Edge

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes: 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32936

Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.4 contains an out-of-bounds write issue while
parsing specially crafted DXF ﬁles. This could result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer
