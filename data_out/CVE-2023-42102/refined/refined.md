- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of AR files, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves user interaction, where the target needs to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious AR file or host a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when processed by Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
