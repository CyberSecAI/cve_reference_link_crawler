Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36024

**Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference in the `FoFiType1C::convertToType1()` function within the poppler library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability occurs because the `enc` pointer, which is intended to hold an encoding array, can become NULL. Subsequently, the code attempts to dereference this null pointer at line 304 `if (enc[i])`, leading to a crash.
*   The code does not properly handle the case where the encoding array pointer is NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference will cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file, forcing the poppler library to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious PDF File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to submit a PDF file to a system that uses a vulnerable version of the poppler library.
*   No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the `FoFiType1C::convertToType1` function.
*   The `enc` variable which is supposed to point to an encoding table, is NULL in the vulnerable case.
*   The crash occurs when accessing `enc[i]` at line 304 because `enc` is a null pointer.
*   The provided GDB output confirms that register `r15`, which holds the value of `enc`, is equal to `0x0` at the crash point.
*   The backtrace shows the function call sequence leading to the vulnerable `FoFiType1C::convertToType1` function.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided information includes the specific vulnerable code location, the circumstances under which the null pointer dereference happens (when `enc` becomes NULL), and a GDB debugging session output illustrating the crash, all of which are not in the CVE description.
