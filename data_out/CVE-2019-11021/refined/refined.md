Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload capability in the `admin/app/mediamanager` component of Schlix CMS. This allows the upload of files with dangerous types, specifically PHP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system fails to properly validate the type of files being uploaded, allowing potentially dangerous files like PHP scripts.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The mediamanager does not sanitize or restrict the file types that can be uploaded by authenticated users.
- **Insufficient Access Controls:** Although requiring admin permissions to exploit, the system does not limit file types, which is a secondary issue in addition to the main flaw of unrestricted file upload, and that even an administrator can still execute code via file upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.
- **Full System Control:** RCE allows the attacker to take full control of the server, including accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings, and potentially using the server as a launchpad for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is initiated through the web interface by uploading a malicious file via the Media Manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to access the vulnerable `admin/app/mediamanager` area. This requires a valid administrator account on the Schlix CMS instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor acknowledges the vulnerability but argues that it requires admin access, implying it is a low-risk issue. They also mention that uploading zipped PHP scripts is allowed for installing extensions, which is still the case in later versions.
- The vendor advises users to keep their systems updated through the Settings > System Update functionality.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type).
- CVSS v3.1 score is 7.2 (High) while CVSS v2.0 score is 6.5 (Medium).
- The vulnerability affects Schlix CMS version 2.1.8-7.
