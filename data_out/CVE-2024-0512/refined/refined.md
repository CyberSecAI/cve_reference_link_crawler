**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any user credentials to carry out the attack.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs the ability to trick a logged-in site administrator into clicking a link.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a CSRF issue present in Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin versions 1.3.87 and below. It allows an unauthenticated attacker to add items to a user's wishlist via a malicious link if they can trick an admin user into clicking it.
