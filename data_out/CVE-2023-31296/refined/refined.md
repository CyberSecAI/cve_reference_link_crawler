- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, a spreadsheet formula can be inserted into the **User Name** field of the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSV Injection (CWE-1236)
- **Impact of exploitation**: When a user exports a CSV file containing the malicious formula in the username field and opens it with spreadsheet software, the injected formula is executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's crafted formula.
- **Attack vectors**: By entering a specially crafted string into the User Name field of the CPTO application. The exported CSV file is the attack vector, once opened by a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a user in the CPTO application with a malicious username string that contains spreadsheet formulas. The attacker also needs to convince a victim to download and open a CSV file of user data from CPTO.
