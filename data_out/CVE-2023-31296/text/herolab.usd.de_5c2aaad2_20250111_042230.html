# usd-2022-0054 | CSV-Injection in User Name in CPTO 6.3.8.6

#

**Advisory ID**: usd-2022-0054
**Product**: Cash Point & Transport Optimizer CPTO
**Affected Version**: 6.3.8.6 (#718) 06.07.2021
**Vulnerability Type**: CWE 1236 - Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
**Security Risk**: Medium
**Vendor URL**: https://www.sesami.io/
**Vendor acknowledged vulnerability**: Yes
**Vendor Status**: Fixed
**CVE number**: CVE-2023-31296
**CVE Link**: Pending

### Description

A spreadsheet formula can be inserted into the **User Name** field. The inserted spreadsheet formula executes when an exported users CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc.

### Fix

Users should update CPTO to its current version.

This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells begin with any of the following characters:

Equals to (=)
Plus (+)
Minus (-)
At (@)
Tab (0x09)
Carriage return (0x0D)

Keep in mind that it is not sufficient to make sure that the untrusted user input does not start with these characters. You also need to take care of the field separator (e.g., ‘,’, or ‘;’) and quotes (e.g., ', or "), as attackers could use this to start a new cell and then have the dangerous character in the middle of the user input, but at the beginning of a cell.

Alternatively, apply the following sanitization to each field of the CSV, so that their content will be read as text by the spreadsheet editor:

* Wrap each cell field in double quotes
* Prepend each cell field with a single quote
* Escape every double quote using an additional double quote
