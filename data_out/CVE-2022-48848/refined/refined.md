{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The osnoise tracer attempts to unregister tracepoints even when they are not registered.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double unregistration of tracepoints"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel warning due to an attempt to unregister an already unregistered tracepoint.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Using trace-cmd to stop tracing and then switch to the 'nop' tracer.",
      "Directly writing to /sys/kernel/tracing/ to first disable tracing and then change the current tracer to 'nop'"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to interact with the tracing filesystem (e.g., write to /sys/kernel/tracing/current_tracer and /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on)."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves checking a flag (`trace_osnoise_callback_enabled`) before attempting to unregister the tracepoints. This prevents the double unregistration scenario."
