Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4675 (based on the file name and surrounding context, although the CVE itself is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of the `event_id` parameter in the `/view/show_events.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it directly uses user-supplied input (`event_id` parameter) without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Inappropriate content display:** Displaying unwanted messages or defacing the website.
    - **Malware download:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering malware downloads.
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and impersonating users.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    - **Reputation damage:** Compromising a trusted website and harming the owner's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the injected JavaScript code in the `event_id` parameter and tricks the user to access the URL.
- The vulnerable URL is: `/view/show_events.php?event_id=[MALICIOUS_PAYLOAD]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `event_id` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.
- **User Interaction (for Reflected XSS):** The attacker must get a victim to click the crafted URL with the malicious payload, typically through social engineering or other means.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `event_id=event_id'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9173)</ScRiPt>` demonstrates how an attacker can inject a script tag containing JavaScript code that will execute when a user visits the page.
