# Stored XSS vulnerability in Outline editor

## Package

Outline

## Affected versions

<v0.77.3

## Patched versions

v0.77.3

## Description

### Summary

A type confusion issue was found in ProseMirror‚Äôs rendering process that leads to a [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability in Outline. An authenticated user can create a document containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When other users view this document, the malicious Javascript can execute in the origin of Outline.

Outline includes CSP rules to prevent third-party code execution, however in the case of self-hosting and having your file storage on the same domain as Outline a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions.

### Details and POC

Please look at Calif's blog: <https://blog.calif.io/p/type-confusion-attacks-in-prosemirror>

| Hi Tom, I updated the advisory to remove my email address and changed the report Google Drive link to our blogpost. The blogpost content is mostly the same as the report. We removed the steps to reproduce section and restructured the format.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
