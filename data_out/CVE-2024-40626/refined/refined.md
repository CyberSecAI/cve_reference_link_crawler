- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A type confusion issue in ProseMirror's rendering process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-843: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a document. When other users view this document, the injected JavaScript can execute within the context of the Outline application. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities. Additionally, if the file storage is on the same domain as Outline, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass CSP restrictions, increasing the attack surface.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker creates a malicious document using the Outline editor. When other users view the document, the vulnerability is triggered. If self-hosted, the file storage being on the same domain allows for malicious file attachments bypassing CSP restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating documents in Outline. The attacker does not need to be local to the system.
