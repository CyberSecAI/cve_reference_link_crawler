The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10129.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from using the loose comparison operator `==` instead of the strict comparison operator `===` in PHP when comparing a user-supplied cookie value with the stored password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type juggling: PHP's loose comparison (`==`) performs type coercion before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results. For example, strings like "240610708" and "QNKCDZO" might evaluate as equal due to type juggling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by providing a password that, due to type juggling, is considered equal to the correct password when compared with the `==` operator, even if the strings are different. This allows an attacker to gain access to the admin panel without knowing the real password.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a specific string that, when compared using `==`, will equate to the administrator's password, an attacker can set an authentication cookie to bypass the login requirements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to set the `auth` cookie to a specially crafted value. This is achievable by directly manipulating the cookie or utilizing other vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to control the cookie value. The attacker would also need to know the administrator's password format or have found a way to cause a type juggling issue.
