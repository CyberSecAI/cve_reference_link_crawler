- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read, leading to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive information
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction required (opening a crafted file)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file. Low privilege is sufficient for exploitation.
