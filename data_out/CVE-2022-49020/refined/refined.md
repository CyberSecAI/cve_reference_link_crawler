```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "In the `p9_socket_open` function within the Linux kernel's 9p networking subsystem, if the memory allocation for `p9_trans_fd` fails, the allocated socket `csocket` is not released, resulting in a socket leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource leak (socket)"
    ],
    "impact": "A socket leak can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the system if the vulnerability is repeatedly triggered.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a 9p client using TCP or Unix domain sockets where memory allocation for `p9_trans_fd` fails inside the `p9_socket_open` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to establish 9p connections, either through network or local access. Specifically, the attacker must be able to cause the memory allocation for p9_trans_fd to fail in order to trigger the leak."
