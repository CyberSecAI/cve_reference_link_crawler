# MaianAffiliate v.1.0 - Code execution and stored XSS (authenticated)

<https://www.maianaffiliate.com/>

# How it works

To exploit this vulnerability one has to log into MaianAffiliate admin panel and add a new product.
The injected payload is reflected on the affiliate mane page (for all authenticated and unauthenticated visitors).

[![Affiliate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25896006/133241512-e94cc320-ece3-4368-9df2-cbc10412cfa2.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25896006/133241512-e94cc320-ece3-4368-9df2-cbc10412cfa2.gif)

This is for educational purposes only. I do not encourage nor do I take responsibility for any unethical or illegal activities related to this exploit.
