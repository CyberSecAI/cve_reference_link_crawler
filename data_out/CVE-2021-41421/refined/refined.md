Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41421 (Note: The provided description for the CVE is a placeholder)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the "add product" functionality within the Maian Affiliate admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the product creation form and stored within the application's database.
- **Code Execution (Potential):** Although not explicitly detailed, the text mentions "Code Execution" in the context of the stored XSS. While XSS itself doesn't directly lead to remote code execution, it can be a stepping stone for further exploitation, depending on the application's architecture and how it handles the injected scripts (e.g. session hijacking).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** The injected script is reflected on the affiliate main page, potentially affecting all visitors (both authenticated and unauthenticated). This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.
- **Code Execution (Potential):** If an attacker uses the XSS vulnerability to leverage a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, the impact could be complete system compromise by gaining control of the server itself.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically the admin panel.
- **Form Injection:** The injection point is the "add product" form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Maian Affiliate admin panel.
- **Form Submission:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the "add product" form.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability exists in Maian Affiliate v.1.0.
- The payload is reflected on the affiliate main page.
- The Github repository provides a GIF demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The information confirms the stored XSS vulnerability is within the "add product" form and is displayed on the affiliate page.
