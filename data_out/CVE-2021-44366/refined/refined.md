{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` application's JSON command parser does not properly validate the type of JSON elements passed in the 'param' field. It assumes that 'param' is always an object, but it can be a different type such as a string. When it attempts to access elements of the 'param' using subscription operators, an assertion failure is triggered if it is not an object. This causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, resulting in a device reboot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The JSON parser does not validate the type of the 'param' field, leading to an assertion failure.",
    "Denial of Service: The assertion failure terminates the `cgiserver.cgi` process, causing a device reboot."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the affected device to reboot. This disrupts camera operation and could be used to repeatedly disable the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint, with a JSON array in the request body. The crafted JSON payload contains a command and a 'param' field which is not an object. If any of the vulnerable commands are used, the device crashes due to the type mismatch.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the camera and the ability to send HTTP POST requests. Although some commands may require a valid session token, it can be bypassed using TALOS-2021-1420 (unauthenticated API access vulnerability)."
