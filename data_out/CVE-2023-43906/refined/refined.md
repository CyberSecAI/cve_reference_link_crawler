- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 404 error page of Xolo CMS v0.11 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error page, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This could lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the "data" parameter of the error.php page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a victim to click on the crafted URL. No authentication or special access is required on the targeted server.
