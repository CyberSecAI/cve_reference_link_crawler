Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formwrlSSIDset` function within the Tenda i21 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unvalidated input:** The `ssidIndex` parameter from the POST request is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to control its size.
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into the `mib_prefix` buffer, using the attacker controlled `ssidIndex`. When the provided `ssidIndex` is too large, it overflows the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a stack overflow. While the provided information doesn't explicitly state the full impact of the overflow, it could allow for arbitrary code execution on the router, potentially leading to complete control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a POST request to the `/goform/wifiSSIDset` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request to the specified URL with an oversized string in the `ssidIndex` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This typically means being on the same network as the router or having access through a port-forwarded connection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is i21 V1.0.0.14(4656).
- The `sprintf` function is used to create a string that will be used in a later memory copy. Since the attacker can control the length of the string using the "ssidIndex", they can control the length of what is copied into the buffer `mib_prefix`, resulting in an overflow.
- A Proof-of-Concept (POC) is provided that demonstrates how to trigger the overflow.
