- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when exporting data to CSV format. Specifically, it does not sanitize DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) commands, which can be embedded in fields like "First Name" or "Last Name".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection vulnerability. The application does not sanitize input before generating a CSV file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious commands into the CSV file. When an administrator opens this CSV file with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, the embedded commands can execute arbitrary code on the administrator's computer. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the administrator's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the CSV export functionality by injecting a malicious formula into the 'First Name' or 'Last Name' field of a Lead record.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low privileges can create or edit records in the application. The administrator must then export the data to a CSV file and open it for the exploit to trigger.
