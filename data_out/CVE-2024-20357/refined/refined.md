- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because bounds-checking does not occur while parsing XML requests in the XML service of Cisco IP Phone firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation in XML parsing leading to out-of-bounds write or read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can initiate phone calls or play sounds on an affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted XML request to the affected device via network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device. No authentication required, and the XML service must be enabled (though it is disabled by default).
