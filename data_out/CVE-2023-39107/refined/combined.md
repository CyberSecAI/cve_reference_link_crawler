## Wrong permissions for NoMachine log directory on macOS

Wrong permissions for the log directory in /Library/Application Support/NoMachine/var on macOS affects installations of NoMachine Enterprise Client and NoMachine Free Edition. While the issue is not remotely exploitable, this makes it possible to local users to create logical links and overwrite unintended files.

This problem has been reported to MITRE, the associated CVE ID is: CVE-2023-39107.

As a workaround, modify the NoMachine log directory ownership and permissions so that only the nx user has read and write permissions set. To do that, run the appropriate command in a terminal, as explained below.

For Enterprise Client package

`sudo chmod 775 /Library/Application\ Support/NoMachine/var/log && sudo chown root:wheel /Library/Application\ Support/NoMachine/var/log`

For NoMachine Free Editions

`sudo chmod 775 /Library/Application\ Support/NoMachine/var/log && sudo chown nx:wheel /Library/Application\ Support/NoMachine/var/log`

# Introduction

[NoMachine](https://nomachine.com) is a free remote desktop solution which features higher speeds than usual competitors. I have identified the possibility to overwrite root-owned files and after
I have created PoC, I have contacted NoMachine team which was quick to address the vulnerability and to issue the new update.

The vulnerability was affecting NoMachine free edition and Enterprise Client for macOS and it is fixed in version *v8.8.1*.

# Analysis

`NoMachine` application writes log files to the directory `/Library/Application Support/NoMachine/var/log`. Examining the permissions of this
directory we can see that the directory is owned by the user `nx` and that `rwx` is set for everyone.

![Permissions of directory](data:image/png;base64...)

The directory contains a couple of `.log` files. Because we are granted `rwx` we can simply create a hardlink which points
to the root-owned file and once the application writes something to the log file, that root-owned file would get overwritten.

# Exploitation

To exploit the vulnerability, we need to simply create the hardlink. As a `root` user, we will create `/Library/secret` file and
make `nxserver.log` as a hardlink to that file.
