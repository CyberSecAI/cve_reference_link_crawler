Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36493

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path within the Intel® SDK for OpenCL™ Applications software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The software does not properly control the locations it searches for resources or libraries. This can be exploited if the application searches for a malicious file in a path controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit can allow a local authenticated user to gain elevated privileges on the system. This can lead to complete control over the compromised system, including data access, modification, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires an attacker to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
* **User Interaction:** User interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   The attacker must be able to place a malicious file in a directory that the vulnerable software would search due to the uncontrolled search path.
* The attacker must trick the user into performing some action that will trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Intel is not providing updates to fix this vulnerability and has issued a Product Discontinuation Notice for the affected software.
*   Intel recommends users to uninstall or discontinue the use of the Intel® SDK for OpenCL™ Applications software.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.7, categorized as MEDIUM severity.
* CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
