Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46960 (Note: This is based on the content provided and not a verified CVE description)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect error code being returned by the `smb2_get_enc_key` function within the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation in the Linux kernel. When the encryption key cannot be obtained, the function was returning `1` instead of `-EAGAIN`. This incorrect return code led to a warning and a call trace during operations like writing to a file or changing file attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect Error Code: The `smb2_get_enc_key` function was designed to return a specific error code (`-EAGAIN`) when it failed to retrieve an encryption key. However, it was returning `1` instead, which is not a standard error code recognized by the kernel's error handling mechanisms.
- Missing Proper Error Handling: The incorrect return code bypassed the usual error handling causing a warning and a call trace during operations like file writing and attribute changes when encryption was needed but the key was not available.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The incorrect return code did not cause a crash or data corruption, but it leads to warning messages and unnecessary call traces in the kernel logs. This can:
-  Make debugging and identifying actual problems more difficult
- Indicate an underlying issue with obtaining encryption keys that needs to be addressed.

**Attack Vectors:** There isn't a direct attack vector to exploit this issue. It's a coding error that gets triggered when the CIFS client fails to get the encryption key from the server, and is not directly exploitable by a malicious actor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific attacker capabilities or positions are required. The issue is triggered internally when there's a failure to obtain the encryption key, which is a normal part of the CIFS protocol.

**Technical Details**
- The `smb2_get_enc_key` function is responsible for retrieving the encryption key required for secure CIFS communication
- When the function fails to retrieve the encryption key, it should return `-EAGAIN` which signals to retry later.
- The original code was returning `1` instead which caused the kernel to not retry, and led to subsequent errors/warnings.
- The fix is to return `-EAGAIN` instead of `1`.

**Summary of Patches**
All provided patches modify the return statement in the `smb2_get_enc_key` function from `return 1;` to `return -EAGAIN;`

**Additional Notes:**
- All the provided content refers to the same fix for the same underlying issue.
- The fix is in `fs/cifs/smb2ops.c`.
- The `Fixes:` tag in the commit messages indicates this patch addresses a previous issue related to potential use-after-free in the demultiplex thread, suggesting that the area of code was modified and this error was introduced.
- The included call trace provides detailed context of the error including function calls and line numbers which can be useful for debugging.
