# Zimbra Collaboration Suite High Severity Zero-Day RCE Vulnerability is Exploited in Wild!

* Post author:[Gururaj Otageri](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/gururaj/ "Posts by Gururaj Otageri")
* Post published:October 10, 2022
* Reading time:5 mins read

**Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS)**, a widely used web client and email server, has an unpatched zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that hackers are known to be actively exploiting. The vulnerability is assigned with **[CVE-2022-41352](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-41352)** and is rated critical (CVSS v3 score: **9.8**). This vulnerability exists due to a method (cpio) in which Zimbra’s antivirus engine (Amavis) scans inbound emails. However, it is essential to have a [vulnerability management software](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) to detect and track such vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-41352 vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files through “**Amavis**” (extraction to /opt/Zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public). Once the vulnerability exploits successfully, it allows an attacker to access other users’ accounts, replace Zimbra’s webroot, and insert shellcodes. CVE-2022-41352 vulnerability can be patched using a [patch management tool](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/).

An attacker would email a malicious **.cpio**, **.tar**, or **.rpm** file to a vulnerable server to exploit this issue. Amavis utilizes **cpio** (general file archiver utility) to extract the file before scanning it for malware. The attacker can write to any path on the filesystem which zimbra user can access, since cpio lacks a mode that prevents it from using untrusted files. Although there are probably more options, the most likely consequence is for the attacker to insert a shell into the web root to get remote code execution.

> If the pax package is not installed, Amavis will fall-back to using cpio. Unfortunately the fallback is implemented poorly (by Amavis) and will allow an unauthenticated attacker to create and overwrite files on the Zimbra server, including the Zimbra webroot.
>
> Zimbra

In addition to this zero-day vulnerability, Zimbra also suffers from a [privilege escalation vulnerability](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-37393), disclosng it publicly. The zero-day in cpio can lead directly to a remote root compromise of Zimbra Collaboration Suite servers!

## Affected Product’s by CVE-2022-41352

* Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0.

---

## Impact of CVE-2022-41352

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

---

## Solution:

Presently no solution is available; Zimbra said it would fix the vulnerability in an upcoming [patch](https://www.secpod.com/topics/reviews/smartest-and-stand-alone-security-solution/) release. However, till then, the vendor has provided a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability; apply the workaround on high priority.

**UPDATE:** Zimbra has released the patch. Please update the Zimbra Collaboration Suite to version 9.0.0 Patch 27, 8.8.15 Patch 34, or later.

Zimbra asks the administrators to ensure by installing the **pax** package on their Zimbra server. Amavis need Pax to extract the contents of compressed attachments for virus scanning.

`pax` installs the package already for most Ubuntu servers, as a pre-requisite for Zimbra. Due to a packaging change in CentOS, there is a high chance `pax` is not installed.

Install `pax` on all your systems as follows:

* **Ubuntu**
  `apt install pax`
* **CentOS 7 and derivatives**
  `yum install pax`
* **CentOS 8 and derivatives**
  `dnf install spax`
* Restart Zimbra using the following:
  `sudo su zimbra -
  zmcontrol restart`

Zimbra has assured that, it will address the issue (CVE-2022-41352) in the next Zimbra patch by making pax as a pre-requisite.

We have an incident where the attacker managed to upload jsp files into Web Client /public directory by simply sending in an email with malicious attachment.

Our system already patched to P26 on Zimbra 9.

The incident timeline and steps:

1. Send a malicious file to one of the user. The amavisd will process this file and I think via cpio loophole, got the file extracted into the target folder /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public.

Sep 7 11:19:46 mb1 amavis[109612]: (109612-08) ESMTP [127.0.0.1]:10024 /opt/zimbra/data/amavisd/tmp/amavis-20220907T111538-109612-whQHcMYk: <adrobots@proton.me> -> <xxx@yyy.zzz> SIZE=130680 Received: from mb1.yyy.zzz ([127.0.0.1]) by localhost (mb1.yyy.zzz [127.0.0.1]) (amavisd-new, port 10024) with ESMTP for <xxx@yyy.zzz>; Wed, 7 Sep 2022 11:19:46 +0800 (+08)

Sep 7 11:19:49 mb1 amavis[109612]: (109612-08) Checking: VHxEN5Rp86Lq [192.168.aa.bb] <adrobots@proton.me> -> <xxx@yyy.zzz>

Sep 7 11:19:49 mb1 amavis[109612]: (109612-08) (!)WARN: Using cpio instead of pax can be a security risk; please add: $pax='pax'; to amavisd.conf and check that the pax(1) utility is available on the system!

Sep 7 11:19:49 mb1 amavis[109612]: (109612-08) (!)WARN: Using cpio instead of pax can be a security risk; please add: $pax='pax'; to amavisd.conf and check that the pax(1) utility is available on the system!

2. The attacker access this file (webshell) via the public and executed "zmprov gdpak" to generate preauth and login into any user they targeted.

3. They login to xxx@yyy.zzz account to delete the file they sent in via step1 to try erase the trail.

We have reported this to Zimbra Support together with the malicious email with the attachment.

All above is possible to happen if the Zimbra installation is **standalone**. A weakness in one of the component (MTA) lead to compromise in other component (Mailstore).

@Yeak, which OS are you running?

pax is in the "prerequisites" of Zimbra with Ubuntu (see here: <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Ubuntu_Upgrades>)

I'm quite sure it is for RHEL/CentOS too.

Also, in an up-to-date (8.8.15P33) amavisd.conf, there's this:

Code: Select all

```
  [['cpio','tar'], \&do_pax_cpio, ['pax', 'gcpio', 'cpio'] ],
```

I've checked on several servers, none as the "cpio instead of pax" warning in the logs.

As you suggest, installing pax "fixes" the issue.

The question for me is to find out why Zimbra's setup procedure didn't mark this as prerequisite for your server and/or how you managed to install the server without the prerequisite.

Edit a bit later: pax is in the "suggested prerequisite", doesn't seem to be mandatory.

On CentOS/RHEL, pax used to be installed by default, that's probably why Zimbra doesn't list it as a dependency on RHEL: <https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=80716>.

But it's not standard anymore since EL6, so it probably should be made an explicit dependency of zimbra-amavisd. Once pax is installed, amavisd automatically prefers it over cpio.

Yes, CentOS 7.9.

Many of our setup use Minimal OS package then begin Zimbra installation. I will get my team to add pax immediately for all deployments.

It looks very much like a stripped down version (db stuff removed) of this web shell : [https://github.com/xl7dev/WebShell/blob ... 0Ninty.jsp](https://github.com/xl7dev/WebShell/blob/master/Jsp/JspSpy%20Private%20Codz%20By%20-%20Ninty.jsp)

Unpacking with cpio, tar and pax using default options all create the symlink and attempt to write the webshell. I'm now looking at the various options to see if there is an obvious one that will prevent that from occurring.

Code: Select all

```
brad@bkd:~/temp/zimbra$ tar -xvf ../news.jpg ; ls -la data
data
data/searchx.jsp
tar: data/searchx.jsp: Cannot open: Not a directory
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

brad@bkd:~/temp/zimbra$ cpio -idv -F ../news.jpg ; ls -la data
data

pax: Unable to create data/searchx.jsp: Not a directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 brad brad 46 Aug 29 20:33 data -> ../../../../../../jetty/webapps/zimbra/public/

```

I fed it into our Zimbra test server and while no malware was identified it didn't trigger an error or drop the payload.

I then went to /usr/bin and

Code: Select all

```
cd /usr/bin ; mv pax pax.old
su - zimbra
zmamavisdctl restart
```

Re-sent the e-mail and :

Code: Select all

```
ls /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public/searchx.jsp
searchx.jsp

```

So make sure pax is installed to mitigate this one.

No Pax :

For everyone else reading running:

Code: Select all

```
yum intall pax
# or
apt-get install pax
```

and restarting Zimbra should take care of the issue:

Code: Select all

```
sudo su zimbra -
zmcontrol restart
```

We will work on adding this to the next patch, thanks.

Given this vulnerability has already bitten at least one person and is clearly in the wild, perhaps an announcement or security advisory might be prudent.

Not everyone reads the forum.

Last week we saw something similar to the first post (on zimbra crontab there was a curl --insecure <https://xxx.yyy.www.zzz/something.jpg> and a pipaed bash) but probably we mistaken it for a mboximport violation an cleaned it as usual. We're gonna check if pax...

I agree, an announcement should be made.

Since the attackers have write access via this vulnerability (presumably as the zimbra user), it's likely it won't be long before they modify the attack to work in some form on dedicated mta servers too.

#### ZCS 8.8.7 released

[ZCS 8.8.7](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.7) was released today. It includes fixes for a Persistent XSS vulnerability, [CVE-2018-6882](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6882) / [bug 108768](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108786) and Mailsploit related issues / [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Note: We recommend that all sites **upgrading** to 8.8.7 manually set **zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress** to **FALSE** which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.

 Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch9 released

[ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 9](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.6.0_Patch9) was released today and includes fixes for two Persistent XSS vulnerabilities, [CVE-2017-8802](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8802) / [bug 107925](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=107925) and [CVE-2017-17703](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17703) / [bug 108265](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108265).

If this patch is not applied, one potential workaround to avoid this issue is to set zimbraPrefUseKeyboardShortcuts to FALSE (for all users/classes-of-service). Note: disabling keyboard shortcuts would have the side effect of disabling all ZCS controlled keyboard shortcuts and this may impact normal user client interaction.

 Feb 9, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZWC affected by Mailsploit

All supported versions of Zimbra Web Client (ZWC) *prior to 8.8.7* are affected by [Mailsploit](https://www.mailsploit.com/). *We recommend that all sites upgrading to 8.8.7 manually set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.*

The workaround which addresses most issues is to set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE (if you are an administrator) for all users/classes-of-service. As an end user you can also control this setting by going to 'Preferences > Display names in place of email addresses when available' and deselecting the checkbox for this option (this is the end user control for the preference attribute mentioned above). This issue is being tracked as [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

At this point, no details have been provided about how any servers were compromised. Without any details, the best advice we can give is:

* Get (and stay) up to date on OS version and patches.
* Get (and stay) up to date on [ZCS](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) version and patches.
* Ensure servers are properly firewalled (see [Ports](/wiki/Ports "Ports") and only allow access to the minimum number of services that is required to meet your business requirements.
* Review and compare your system configuration against best practices like the [CIS benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/latest/).

#### Workaround: OpenSSL padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)

The [2016-05-03 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding a padding oracle in the AES-NI CBC MAC check affects [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/) of ZCS 8.0-8.6.0 (via MTAs and Proxy).

We anticipate releasing 8.6.1 (and 8.7) with fixes for this issue, however if this issue is impacting your environment, the recommended workaround is covered in [bug 104982](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104982). NOTE: in ZCS 8.7+ we are able to easily patch third party packages included with ZCS via [package repos](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository).

First, test that you are vulnerable with the following tool:

<https://filippo.io/CVE-2016-2107/>

* Edit /opt/zimbra/.bash\_profile
  - add the following to the end of user zimbra's .bash\_profile (requires root privs):

  `# workaround CVE-2016-2107

  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000"`
* Edit sudoers - add the following line to your sudoers (/etc/sudoers or whatever is appropriate for your platform):

  `Defaults env_keep += "OPENSSL_ia32cap"`
* Configure postfix - instructs postfix to honor the desired environment variable:

  `$ zmlocalconfig -e postfix_import_environment='OPENSSL_ia32cap'`

A special thanks to Malte Stretz from our Gold Partner, [Silpion](http://www.silpion.de/), for his persistence and hard work to gather the information covered in this workaround! Also this article would be incomplete without mentioning that the original inspiration for this workaround came from <https://mjanja.ch/2013/11/disabling-aes-ni-on-linux-openssl/>.

#### In Brief: DROWN / Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0800)

The [2016-03-01 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding [DROWN](https://drownattack.com/) via SSLv2 affects ZCS 8.0.x (via MTAs), but no other currently [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/). See [How to disable SSLv3](/wiki/How_to_disable_SSLv3 "How to disable SSLv3"), as it includes instructions on disabling SSLv2 and SSLv3. Additional info may also be found in [bug 104130](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104130).

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5 availability

ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5 is available (officially released Dec 21, 2015). Patch 5 includes fixes for five (5) CVE's (ref: [Zimbra Security Advisories](/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories "Zimbra Security Advisories")). Three of the CVE-IDs referenced in the patch come via 3rd party components shipped w/ZCS. Please note, one of the fixed vulnerabilities is [rated as major](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Vulnerability_Rating_Classification). See the [blog post](https://blog.zimbra.com/2015/12/zimbra-collaboration-8-6-patch-5-now-available/) or the release notes (available from the [downloads](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) area for additional notes on ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5.

[Update: Feb 2, 2016]

If you can not patch immediately, the XSS bug classified as major (bug 101435) can be worked around by either disabling or uninstalling (zmzimletctl undeploy) the com\_zimbra\_url (aka URL links) zimlet.

#### OpenSSL alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793)

Today's announcement by OpenSSL (<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20150709.txt>) regarding alternative chains certificate forgery does not affect any Zimbra Collaboration releases.

Specifically, the latest Zimbra Collaboration 8.6 release ships with OpenSSL 1.0.1l, but this issue affects the following OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o only.

#### A note on Logjam

There is a lot of chatter about [Logjam - https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/) today.

At this time, the initial impacts to Collab seem to be minimal and are currently limited to the MTA, specifically possible setting changes, depending upon your environment.

Today we updated the [MTA Ciphers](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86#Ciphers_4) section of our Collab 8.6 security wiki page. In short, for anyone concerned about the Logjam (cipher downgrade) style of MitM attacks, the use of 'export' and 'low' ciphers in Postfix should be avoided. Please note that Postfix, by default (<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers>) allows use of lower ciphers. Changing these to 'medium' can reduce client interoperability and/or may cause some clients to fall back to in the clear communication channels instead of using lower grade encryption.

As usual, there are trade-offs involved, but in the light of FREAK ([https://freakattack.com](https://freakattack.com/)) and Logjam ([https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/)) attacks, it may also be argued that using ciphers lower than 'medium' is now potentially providing an illusion of security. With this in mind, our current recommendation is to avoid both 'export' and 'low' ciphers with the hope that complete deprecation of these ciphers will be coming soon.

Please visit <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86> to keep up with our latest recommendations. Also, for those looking to strengthen their security posture, in Collab 8.7 we have a number of enhancements slated including the ability to strengthen **[DH params](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=98852)**. A sneak preview of security related changes/enhancements in the works is available at <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/87>.

Lastly, for those with openssl 1.0.2 available, you may find this post from OpenSSL useful <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/>

Update for 8.0.x customers: In Collab 8.0.x, Java 1.7 is used. Unfortunately, in Java 1.7, the DH parameters are hard-coded to 768 bits (excluding when using export cipher suites, which use 512 bits, but those should already be disabled). The workaround is to use the (Nginx) Proxy always. The other option is to disable all DHE suites. Which has the side effect of losing forward secrecy for any user agents that do not support ECDHE.

#### What the FREAK attack means to Zimbra

Zimbra is aware of a newly disclosed SSL/TLS vulnerability that provides a potential malicious actor with a method to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack the vulnerability is being referred to as FREAK (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), utilizing [CVE-2015-0204](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0204).

The attack allows a malicious actor to force a downgrade of a secure connection to a vulnerable, export grade encryption (READ: weak encryption). Which, [according to Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/03/freak-flaw-undermines-security-for-apple-and-google-users-researchers-discover/), is downgraded to 512-bit encryption that was the maximum allowed under the export controls in place during the 1990s in the U.S. The Washington Post piece goes on to say it is possible to crack 512-bit encryption, today, in approximately 7 hours with the use of 75 computers, which can be rented from a cloud computing provider for approximately $100.

[Matthew Green](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html), cryptographer and research professor from Johns Hopkins, provided a Cliffs Notes version:

A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a 'man in the middle attacker' to downgrade connections from 'strong' RSA to 'export-grade' RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a shocking number of websites -- including government websites. Patch soon and be careful.

In addition to Matthew Green's post and the Washington Post article, the [freakattack.com](http://freakattack.com/) site has additional information, including a list of the top domains still vulnerable, as well as a built in check of the browser used to surf to the site.

#### Zimbra Specifics

Zimbra ships with the OpenSSL library. At this time, Zimbra has assessed Zimbra Collaboration 8.x, 7.x and found no susceptibility to the FREAK attack in the servers. As there is a client side component to this attack, please verify that you are running the latest browsers/clients to lower the risk to this type of attack.

As part of our security program, Zimbra will continue to monitor all developments related to the FREAK vulnerability and update this post as needed.

#### GNU C Library Vulnerability — aka GHOST

Zimbra is aware of a Linux vulnerability, specifically the GNU C Library.

**Details**

The vulnerability appears to have been found by [Qualys](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability) and disclosed in security advisory [CVE 2015-0235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235). It should be noted that the vulnerability was patched in v 2.17 of the library, but at the time was not categorized as a security issue, leading many to maintain stable versions, i.e. vulnerable versions. This is an operating system vulnerability; at this time, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no known exploits against Zimbra's software related to CVE 2015-0235.

**\*\*Recommendation\*\***

Zimbra recommends that anyone running Linux update their systems as soon as possible. And while Linux doesn't usually require a restart, it is recommended to ensure all underlying software services are patched.

**Patches or acknowledgements**

#### POODLE Revisited

We have received a few inquiries about the reported TLS protocol vulnerability via the POODLE attack. SSL/TLS services in ZCS come from OpenSSL and Java. This vulnerability does not affect OpenSSL (ref: [http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users@openssl.org/msg75804.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users%40openssl.org/msg75804.html)) and Java is not known to be affected.

#### Security Advisory: Zimbra Community 8.x Security Vulnerability

Security is top of mind for everyone here at Zimbra, which is why we want to inform you that our team just discovered a security vulnerability in Zimbra Community 8.0 (formerly Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise). The vulnerability is relegated to a very specific scenario in which a user within Zimbra Community 8.0 is able to view a user password via a specific API call.

**Summary:** The Zimbra development team has identified a very specific scenario where a user’s password in Community 8 is stored insecurely.

**Affected Versions:** 8.0.0.37997 (unpatched), 8.0.1.39116

**Vulnerability Scoring:** CVSS: 1.4

**Obtaining a fix:** <http://telligent.com/support/m/support/1354746.aspx>

**Details:** The administrative feature to create users leverages non-public APIs that can force a user’s password to be inadvertently stored insecurely.

**Reporter:** Alex Crome (Zimbra)

**When does this occur?**

1. Creating a user through the control panel using Membership Administration (requires administrative privileges)

2. Could occur if a custom plugin was deployed that copied off the extended attributes on a create user event and in turn re-saved those attributes using the UpdateUser API (this is unlikely, but possible)

If you have any questions or would like assistance with applying the patch, please contact support.

This advisory was originally [published here](http://blog.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2014/06/community-8-x-critical-security-vulnerability.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zimbra+%28Zimbra+%3A%3A+Blog%29).

#### Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)

**20140606: Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)**

On June 5, 2014 the OpenSSL project released a [security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt). [CVE-2014-0224](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0224) can allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to be carried out between a vulnerable client and vulnerable server. It is also important to note that Zimbra does not use DTLS nor do we have SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS enabled.

The impact to Zimbra Collaboration Server is as follows:

* ZCS 6 is not affected
* ZCS 7 is not affected
* ZCS 8 is affected

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable.

If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>). Please upgrade to a newer version first, then run this patch.

Zimbra has produced a patch for OpenSSL vulnerabily for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

The following patch instructions must be done on a per server basis:

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol stop

```

* As root:

```
cd /tmp
wget http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh
chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
./zmopenssl-updater.sh

```

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol start

```

After a successful patch, ZCS 8.0.7 will be running 1.0.1h. To verify this, run the following as zimbra user:

```
openssl version

```

On an 8.0.7 patched system the result should be:

```
zimbra$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1h 5 Jun 2014

```

Earlier versions of ZCS will show other versions of OpenSSL - Zimbra patches the existing OpenSSL version appropriate to each ZCS version.

Continue to the next server and repeat the patch process.

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries. It only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra.

#### Critical Security Advisory and Builds/Patches for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability

**Overview**

Zimbra Collaboration Server 8 is susceptible to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug:

* <http://heartbleed.com>
* <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt>
* <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160>

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link directly to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable. Only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are reported as being vulnerable.

Zimbra has produced an OpenSSL patch for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>), so you would please need to upgrade to a secure version first, then run this patch.

The patch is located here:

* <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>

The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Please note: this vulnerability is being reported as having existed and actively attacked since 2012. As such, the private SSL keys for your platform may already have been compromised. After patching, it is recommended to regenerate your SSL certificates and private keys. This is unfortunate, but the only way to ensure that an attacker cannot decrypt your SSL session data.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue if running OpenSSL 1.0.1. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries - it only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra. For example:

* RHEL6\_64 and UBUNTU12\_64 both use OpenSSL 1.0.1 at the OS level and are affected
* SLES11\_64 and UBUNTU10\_64 use OpenSSL 0.9.8 at the OS level, so are not affected

### Patching

The steps to patch are the following:

(as root)
1) wget <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>
2) chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
3) ./zmopenssl-updater.sh

### Zimbra Collaboration 8.0.7 Builds

Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.0.7 - both the Network Edition and Open-Source Edition - have been rebuilt to include the fix for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability.

If you haven't yet upgraded to 8.0.7, the current versions up on the Download site now disable TLS Heartbeat and protect against the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability:

* Network Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-network.html>
* Open-Source Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-opensource.html>

In short:

* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 prior to Thursday, April 10, then your version DOES NOT include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6020 -> **Vulnerable, you would still need the OpenSSL patch**: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/70921-critical-security-advisory-patch-openssl-heartbleed-vulnerability.html>
* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 Thursday, April 10 or after, then your version DOES include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6021 -> **Not Vulnerable, no patch required**

### OpenSSL Patch Update for ZCS 8.0.3 Only

If you patched for the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability for Zimbra Collaboration Server 8.0.3 prior to Wed April 09, 2014, 11:00 Eastern/08:00 Pacific, you will need to re-patch.

Please note: this is ONLY for ZCS 8.0.3. All other patches were fine, but the 8.0.3 openssl builds were still vulnerable. Repeating, this is only for ZCS 8.0.3.

Here is how you can check your build version:
$ zmcontrol -v
(look for "8.0.3")

Please use the test methods below to confirm.

### Testing

There are a few ways you can confirm if your system is vulnerable:

1. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check your version tarball for the build number 6021. For example:

* [http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7\_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64.20140408123937.tgz](http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7_GA_6021.RHEL6_64.20140408123937.tgz) - the build number here is "6021"

2. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check zmcontrol for the build number:

# su - zimbra
$ zmcontrol -v
Release 8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64\_20140408123937 RHEL6\_64 NETWORK edition.

3. If running any version of Zimbra Collaboration, check if the libssl shared library is built with dlts1\_heartbeat:

**Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
dtls1\_heartbeat
$

**Not Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
$

Please let Zimbra know promptly if any problems or questions.

### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions.
