- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from crafted HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote command execution vulnerability, arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with *Administrator*-level credentials on the affected device.
