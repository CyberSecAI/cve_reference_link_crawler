The provided content is a Talos Vulnerability Report that includes CVE-2021-44376 among a list of other CVEs affecting Reolink RLC-410W cameras.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cgiserver.cgi` process, which manages API requests, incorrectly assumes that the "param" field within a JSON request will always be a JSON object. When a string value is provided for "param" instead, the code attempts to access it using the subscription operator (`[]`), leading to an assertion failure and subsequent process crash, resulting in a device reboot. This is due to insufficient input validation in the JSON command parser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the type of the "param" field in the JSON request, assuming it will always be a JSON object.
* The `cgiserver.cgi` process does not handle the situation where the `param` field is not an object appropriately, causing it to assert and crash.
* There are multiple APIs vulnerable to this issue, where a crafted request with a non-object "param" value will trigger the crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashing and the device rebooting. This can disrupt the camera's functionality.
*  If a chain of exploits is used which includes  TALOS-2021-1420 to bypass authentication, a complete loss of service will occur for the camera.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the camera's `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
* **JSON Payload:** The request body contains a JSON array where the `"param"` field is set to a string instead of an object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the camera to send the malicious HTTP requests.
* **Unauthenticated Access (with chained exploit):** While the described vulnerability generally requires a logged-in user, it is mentioned that it can be combined with TALOS-2021-1420 to exploit the camera without authentication.
* **Knowledge of the API:**  The attacker needs to know the API endpoint and format to trigger the vulnerability.

Specifically for **CVE-2021-44376**:

**Vulnerability:** `SetIsp`â€™s JSON `param` parser will assume that the `param` JSON element is an object, accessing it using subscription operator.
**Exploitation:** Sending a crafted request with `"cmd": "SetIsp"` and a string value for the `"param"` field will cause a denial of service.

        "cmd": "SetIsp",
        "action": 0,
