SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal (KMC) does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in KMC servlet. An attacker could craft a script and trick the user into clicking it. When a victim who is registered on the portal clicks on such link, confidentiality and integrity of their web browser session could be compromised.
