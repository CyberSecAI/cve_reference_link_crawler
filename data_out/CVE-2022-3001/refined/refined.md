- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input handling at the camera's web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the Milesight Video Management System (VMS) software due to the way it processes input, specifically HTTP requests, at the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the targeted network camera, making it unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the targeted network camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the targeted device.
