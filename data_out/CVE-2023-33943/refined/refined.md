- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in the Account module. Specifically, the First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and Job Title fields do not properly encode or sanitize user input before rendering it in the user interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects a crafted payload containing malicious JavaScript into the First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, or Job Title fields of a user's account. When another user views the profile, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account on the Liferay instance and be able to edit their user profile. They would also need another user to view the profile to trigger the XSS.
