    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's browser session

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerable component is accessible over the network, making it remotely exploitable.
- User Interaction Required: A user must interact with the vulnerable component for the attack to be successful (e.g., by visiting a page with the malicious script injected).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior access to the vulnerable system (no privileges required).
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious script in the front end "unsubscribe" module.
