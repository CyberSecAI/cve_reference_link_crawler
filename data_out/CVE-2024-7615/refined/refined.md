Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSafeClientFilter`, `fromSafeMacFilter`, and `fromSafeUrlFilter` functions within the `/bin/httpd` program of the Tenda FH1206 router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `fromSafeClientFilter` function copies user-supplied input from the `Go` parameter directly to a stack variable `v15` using `strcpy`. The size of the stack buffer `v15` is not validated against the size of the data supplied via `Go` parameter.
- The functions `fromSafeMacFilter` and `fromSafeUrlFilter` are also vulnerable to the same stack overflow condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By sending an overly long value via the `Go` parameter, an attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow, leading to denial of service.
- The overflow can potentially be used to overwrite adjacent stack memory locations, potentially hijacking the control flow and executing arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the router's web interface, specifically to the `/goform/SafeClientFilter`, `/goform/SafeMacFilter` and `/goform/SafeUrlFilter` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- Network connectivity to the router is required, implying that the attacker would likely need to be on the local network. However, it might be possible to exploit this remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement to trigger the vulnerable code, therefore the vulnerability is likely exploitable without authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a POST request to `/goform/SafeClientFilter` with an overly long string in the `Go` parameter.
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1206 V1.2.0.8(8155).
- The CVE assigned to this vulnerability is CVE-2024-7615.
