- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app allows a local, non-privileged user to disable the application without the required passcode. This occurs when the "Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App" setting is configured to "Allow with Passcode".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269), specifically a bypass of the passcode requirement for disabling the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A non-privileged user can disable the GlobalProtect app, leading to a potential disruption of network security and potentially exposing the system to unauthorized access by disabling VPN functionality. The confidentiality and integrity of the product remain unaffected, however availability is impacted.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the vulnerable GlobalProtect app installed.
