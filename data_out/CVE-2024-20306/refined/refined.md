- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the Unified Threat Defense (UTD) configuration CLI of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as *root* on the underlying host operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker submits a crafted CLI command to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated, local user with level 15 privileges on the affected device.
