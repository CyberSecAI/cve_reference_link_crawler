- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server module in SICAM A8000 devices allows unauthenticated access to its web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Access Control (CWE-284), allowing unauthenticated access to the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could retrieve debug-level information, such as internal network topology or connected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, by accessing the web server interface of the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected device. The web server module needs to be manually activated within the protocol firmware.
