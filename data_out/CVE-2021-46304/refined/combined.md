SUMMARY

A vulnerability was identiﬁed in the web server module used in the SICAM A8000 CP-8000, CP-8021 and
CP-8022 devices’ protocol ﬁrmwares.

• AGPMT0 (AGP Master)
• DNPiT1 (DNP3 TCP/IP Server)
• DNPiT2 (DNP3 TCP/IP Client)
• DNPMT0 (DNP3 Master seriell)
• DNPST0 (DNP3 Slave seriell)
• ET83 (61850 Ed.1)
• ET85 (61850 Ed.2)
• MBCiT0 (MODBUS TCP/IP Client)
• MBSiT0 (MODBUS TCP/IP Server)
• MODMT2 (MODBUS Master seriell)
• OPUPT0 (OPCUA Pub/Sub)
• OPUPT1 (Mindconnect)

The vulnerability could allow unauthenticated access to the web interface of the affected web server
module. The module is used for diagnostic purposes as well as commissioning and has to be activated
manually within the protocol ﬁrmwares. For this reason the protocol ﬁrmwares are secure by default.
Siemens updated the manual to make the situation transparent and raise awareness for operators.

Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of
the grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) series is a modular device range for telecontrol and
automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
