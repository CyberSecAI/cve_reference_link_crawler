- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation when parsing specially crafted MODEL files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The application attempts to write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious MODEL file using the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious MODEL file. No special privileges are required. User interaction is required.
