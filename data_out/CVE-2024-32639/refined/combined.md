SSA-923361: MODEL File Parsing Vulnerability in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation before V2302.0011

| Publication Date: | 2024-05-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-05-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation contains an out of bounds write vulnerability that could be triggered when the application reads MODEL files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file using the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.

Siemens has released a new version for Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 and recommends to update to the latest version.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and their processes. These models enable analysis of material flow, resource utilization and logistics for all levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and specific lines, well in advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-32639

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted MODEL file. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-22974)
