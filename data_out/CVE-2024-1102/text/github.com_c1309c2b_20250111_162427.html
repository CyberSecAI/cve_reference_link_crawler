| When the database connection to the job-repository cannot be established (using the JdbcRepository), then an exception is thrown:   [jsr352/jberet-core/src/main/java/org/jberet/repository/JdbcRepository.java](https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/blob/87dd8202797e628a4a3bc5b468b1a8ae1c1e9698/jberet-core/src/main/java/org/jberet/repository/JdbcRepository.java#L1115)  Line 1115 in [87dd820](/jberet/jsr352/commit/87dd8202797e628a4a3bc5b468b1a8ae1c1e9698)   |  | throw BatchMessages.MESSAGES.failToObtainConnection(e, dbUrl, dbProperties); | | --- | --- |     The exception message is constructed using the 'dbProperties':  [jsr352/jberet-core/src/main/java/org/jberet/\_private/BatchMessages.java](https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/blob/87dd8202797e628a4a3bc5b468b1a8ae1c1e9698/jberet-core/src/main/java/org/jberet/_private/BatchMessages.java#L103)  Line 103 in [87dd820](/jberet/jsr352/commit/87dd8202797e628a4a3bc5b468b1a8ae1c1e9698)   |  | @Message(id = Message.INHERIT, value = "Failed to obtain connection from %s, %s") | | --- | --- |     The 'dbProperties' might contain username and password for the database-connection. So if this exception is logged, the resulting log might looks like this: `"JBERET000622 Failed to obtain connection from <jdbc-url>, {password=<password_in_plain_text>, user=<username_in_plain_text>}"`   Therefore, database-credentails might be logged unobfuscated as plain text to the console and are visible for everyone that has access to it - which might be a security risk. |
