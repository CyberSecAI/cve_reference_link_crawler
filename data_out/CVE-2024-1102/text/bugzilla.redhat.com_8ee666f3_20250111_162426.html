| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2262060#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2024-01-31 08:01:33 UTC  ``` When the database connection to the job-repository cannot be established (using the JdbcRepository), then an exception is thrown. The exception message is constructed using the 'dbProperties'. The 'dbProperties' might contain username and password for the database-connection.Therefore, database-credentails might be logged unobfuscated as plain text to the console and are visible for everyone that has access to it - which might be a security risk.
