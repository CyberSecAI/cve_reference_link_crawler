Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `jberet-core` component, when failing to establish a database connection, logs an exception message that includes the database connection properties (`dbProperties`). These properties might contain sensitive information like the username and password in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Logging of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the logging of database credentials within an exception message. This exposes sensitive information in plain text.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The exposed credentials could be easily accessible to anyone with access to the logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** If an attacker gains access to the logs containing the database credentials, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to the database could lead to a data breach, compromising sensitive data.
*   **Compromised Infrastructure:** The database credentials might provide access to other parts of the infrastructure, leading to a wider compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log File Access:** An attacker would need to gain access to the system's log files.
*   **Unprotected Logs:** The attacker would need to find log files where this vulnerability is logged, either on disk, in a log management tool, or through other exposure points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Logs:** Attackers require some form of access to the system's logs, possibly through compromised user accounts, vulnerable systems, or insider access.
*   **No Code Execution Required:** No direct code execution is necessary to exploit this vulnerability; only access to the logs containing the leaked credentials is needed.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability is present in `org/jberet/repository/JdbcRepository.java` where the exception is thrown and in `org/jberet/_private/BatchMessages.java` where the message is constructed.
The vulnerability was fixed by removing the sensitive db credentials from the exception message.
The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0.2, available for RHEL 8 and RHEL 9.
