Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly incorporates the `employee_code` parameter from user input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `employee_code` parameter in the `Master.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:**  A malicious actor could potentially modify data or gain unauthorized access to the database server through SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to `/employee_gatepass/classes/Master.php?f=log_employee`.
- **Malicious Input:** The `employee_code` parameter is the injection point, where a specially crafted string is sent within the POST request body

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests to send a malicious POST request
- **SQL Knowledge:** Knowledge of SQL is required to craft the SQL injection payloads.
