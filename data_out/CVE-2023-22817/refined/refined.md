{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Server-side request forgery vulnerability",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability stems from the device's handling of DNS addresses, where a rogue server on the local network can modify its URL using another DNS address to point back to the loopback adapter. This allows the modified URL to exploit other vulnerabilities on the local server.",
    "impact": "A rogue server on the local network can potentially exploit other vulnerabilities on the local server by redirecting requests through the loopback adapter.",
    "attack_vectors": "A rogue server on the local network can manipulate DNS addresses to redirect traffic.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have control of a server on the same local network as the vulnerable device and be able to modify its DNS address."
