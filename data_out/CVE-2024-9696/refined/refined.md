Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'rescue_tab' shortcode of the Rescue Shortcodes WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and stored in the WordPress database. These scripts are then executed when a user views a page containing the vulnerable shortcode. Specifically, the `class` attribute of the `rescue_tab` shortcode was not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** When a user accesses an infected page, the injected script executes, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, modify page content, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Website Defacement:**  Attackers may alter the appearance or functionality of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the `rescue_tab` shortcode by injecting malicious code into its attributes, particularly the 'class' attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This access level allows users to create and edit posts and pages, where they can insert shortcodes.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker must be able to utilize and manipulate the `rescue_tab` shortcode.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Rescue Shortcodes plugin up to and including version 2.8.
- The issue is resolved in version 2.9 by using `sanitize_html_class()` instead of `sanitize_text_field()` on the `class` attribute in the `rescue_tab_shortcode` function. The changelog also mentions "Improve sanitization on tabs".
- The provided diffs from the WordPress plugins trac show the specific code changes related to this fix.
