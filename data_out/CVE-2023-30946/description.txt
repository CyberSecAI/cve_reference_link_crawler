A security defect was identified in Foundry Issues. If a user was added to an issue on a resource that they did not have access to and consequently could not see, they could query Foundry's Notification API and receive metadata about the issue including the RID of the issue, severity, internal UUID of the author, and the user-defined title of the issue.
