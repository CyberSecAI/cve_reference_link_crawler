VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-44087

Affected applications do not properly validate certain fields in incoming network packets on port 4410/tcp. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an integer overflow and crash of the application. This denial of service condition could prevent legitimate users from using subsequent products that rely on the affected application for license verification.
