A small correction/addendum based on reading the vulnerability report and the PR
that fixes this (as well as being quite familiar with Python zipfile.ZipFile
internals and confused how this would affect it): it's not zipfile.ZipFile and
its methods that are affected, at least not directly, but zipfile.Path.  The
issue being this code in zipfile._path._ancestry():

  path = path.rstrip(posixpath.sep)
  while path and path != posixpath.sep:
      yield path
      path, tail = posixpath.split(path)

Which results in an infinite loop because for example posixpath.split("//") ==
("//", "") but "//" != posixpath.sep:

  >>> it = zipfile._path._parents("//foo")
  >>> next(it)
  '//'
  >>> next(it)
  '//'
  >>> next(it)
  '//'

The infinite loop has been fixed by sanitising the paths.
