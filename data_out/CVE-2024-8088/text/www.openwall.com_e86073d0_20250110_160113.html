Forgot to mention this: the infinite loop is triggered when zipfile.Path adds
"implied directories" -- using _parents(), which calls _ancestry() -- in the
overridden .namelist() for the custom zipfile.ZipFile subclass it wraps.  Which
is (indirectly) used by almost all of the zipfile.Path methods like .iterdir(),
.glob(), .exists(), .joinpath() etc.

  >>> zf = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(), "w")
  >>> zf.filename = "foo.zip"
  >>> zf.writestr("a/b/c", "abc")
  >>> zf.writestr("d/e", "de")
  >>> zf.namelist()
  ['a/b/c', 'd/e']
  >>> zf.__class__
  <class 'zipfile.ZipFile'>

  >>> p = zipfile.Path(zf)
  >>> p.root.namelist()
  ['a/b/c', 'd/e', 'a/b/', 'a/', 'd/']
  >>> list(p.iterdir())
  [Path('foo.zip', 'a/'), Path('foo.zip', 'd/')]
  >>> zf.__class__
  <class 'zipfile._path.CompleteDirs'>

  >>> zf.writestr("//oops", "oops")
  >>> # infinite loop via joinpath -> resolve_dir -> _name_set -> namelist ->
  >>> # _implied_dirs -> _ancestry
  >>> p / "foo"

As zipfile.Path modifies the class of the original ZipFile, calling .namelist()
or .extractall() on the original ZipFile used to create the Path afterwards is
also affected even though zipfile.ZipFile as such is not.
