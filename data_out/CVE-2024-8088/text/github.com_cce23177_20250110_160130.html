| Sanitising is good. But e.g. `.open()` will not work if it can't map back to the original path to pass that to `ZipFile.open()`. Though `.joinpath()` will of course never use `//` or `\\`, so opening these files already required constructing the path without using that. Not sure what's best here if opening files with paths affected by sanitising is meant to be supported. |

Though `.namelist()` will still be "wrong" for the ZipFile (e.g. when calling `.extractall()`). And it doesn't handle "duplicates" (see above). |

| I was not expecting that `foo\bar` or `d:/foo` were in use in zip files.  Are these file names common? Maybe not. But on Linux these are perfectly acceptable file names. And whilst they may indeed cause portability issues for Windows users and I would thus avoid them when creating ZIP files for use on Windows, the ZIP format also considers them perfectly acceptable.  I myself have quite a few music files with odd file names; song titles can be quite varied. And whilst I've sometimes run into problems extracting those files on other operating systems I have never had issues creating or listing ZIP files.  File names like `foo/..//./bar` can be considered malformed and would not be generated by simply creating a ZIP file from an existing directory tree. But `d:/foo\\bar` is not malformed, just unusual (and perhaps not portable).  ``` $ mkdir d: $ echo "Hi!" >> d:/foo\\bar $ zip -r foo.zip d:   adding: d:/ (stored 0%)   adding: d:/foo\bar (stored 0%) $ unzip -l foo.zip Archive:  foo.zip   Length      Date    Time    Name ---------  ---------- -----   ----         0  2024-08-24 04:04   d:/         4  2024-08-24 04:04   d:/foo\bar ---------                     -------         4                     2 files $ python3 -mzipfile -l foo.zip File Name                                             Modified             Size d:/                                            2024-08-24 04:04:20            0 d:/foo\bar                                     2024-08-24 04:04:20            4 $ zipinfo.py -e foo.zip Archive:  foo.zip Zip file size: 308 bytes, number of entries: 2 drwx------  3.0 unx        0 bx        0 stor 2024-08-24 04:04:20 00000000 d:/ -rw-------  3.0 unx        4 tx        4 stor 2024-08-24 04:04:20 54a8a39c d:/foo\bar 2 files, 4 bytes uncompressed, 4 bytes compressed:  0.0%  ```  Tools like `zip` and `unzip` and my own `zipinfo.py` handle them just fine. So I would expect the same from Python. And indeed `zipfile.ZipFile` handles them just fine. But `zipfile.Path` now rejects them.  I generally expect to be able to take any directory tree and turn it into a ZIP file without having to worry about file names containing colons or backslashes. Or at the most that I might need to be careful when extracting them on Windows. I would not expect to have problems merely listing the contents, especially when not even using Windows.  So it is very surprising when `zipfile.Path` effectively rejects perfectly valid ZIP files just because they have "unsupported" file names, especially since it didn't do so before. I would perhaps expect this kind of backwards-incompatible change to happen in a major version, given a good reason, but not in a security patch. And for it to be clearly documented if the interface is constrained like this. It also fails in unexpected ways, instead of providing a clear error message that makes it clear the problem is an unsupported file name. |

| My expectation was that paths affected by sanitizing would not be supported.  And my expectation would be that such paths would be either explicitly rejected as malformed if they cannot reasonably be supported. Or when they can be, handled gracefully with a portable interface that maps sanitised names providing a consistent interface that can reasonably be supported onto the underlying file names instead of simply causing attempts to read files to fail because the underlying file name does not match the sanitised one. And before this change, `d:/foo\\bar` worked just fine. |

| This worked perfectly fine before. Now it raises `FileNotFoundError`.  ``` >>> zf = zipfile.ZipFile("foo.zip", "r") >>> zf.namelist() ['d:/', 'd:/foo\\bar'] >>> p = zipfile.Path(zf) >>> (p / "d:").is_dir() True >>> (p / "d:" / "foo\\bar").read_text() 'Hi!\n' ```  And if `d:/foo\\bar` is not considered a valid path by `zipfile.Path`, I'd expect an error. Instead it happily tells me there is a file named `d/foo/bar`. Except when I try reading I get an error that says there is no such file:  ``` >>> (p / "d" / "foo" / "bar").is_file() True >>> (p / "d" / "foo" / "bar").read_text() KeyError: "There is no item named 'd/foo/bar' in the archive" ``` |

| It seems I've stumbled into a hornets nest. When I received the report about the infinite loops, my objective was to try to understand the broader problem and not simply address an issue with the infinite loops. I sought to figure out why `zipfile.extractall` was not affected by the same issue, which led me to the [sanitizing behavior that it applies](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/bcc1be39cb1d04ad9fc0bd1b9193d3972835a57c/Lib/zipfile/__init__.py#L1799-L1813). I drew inspiration from that in an attempt to generalize the kinds of unsupported, malformed paths. At the same time, I took the opportunity to be more constraining in order to provide a uniform experience on any platform. As originally designed, `zipfile.Path` aims to support basic, commonly constructed zip files.  Note that it's not just `d:/foo` that's no longer allowed, e.g. `V: The New Mythology Suite.flac` is now also a forbidden file name (though `extractall()` would remove the "V: " -- but only on Windows, and only when extracting, not listing files).  Yeah, that's unfortunate, but I think zipfile.Path does not wish to support this name because it isn't valid on commonly-found operating systems... or to support the name, but in a uniform way. In my opinion, it's more desirable to have a consistent behavior than to have varying behavior depending on platform.  On the other hand, supporting this name for traversal on any operating system should be fine, right up until the point that these files are manifest on the file system, such as [`importlib.resources.as_file` does here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/dbc1752d4107532d312c78263212e807a3674eb1/Lib/importlib/resources/_common.py#L191-L210).  ~~zipfile.Path aims to represent the zipfile in a way that's safe to "extract all contents" on any platform, which means it can't expose `V: The New Mythology...` as any component of the path.~~  Meanwhile, this seems incorrect:  ``` >>> zipfile._path.SanitizedNames._sanitize("d:/foo") 'd/foo' >>> zipfile._path.SanitizedNames._sanitize("/d:/foo") 'd:/foo' ```  Yes, I agree. Probably all colons should be disallowed.  `.open()` will not work if it can't map back to the original path to pass that to `ZipFile.open()`  That's a good point, and not something I considered when sanitizing, and really suggests that sanitizing early is much more complicated than it sounds.  Meanwhile, as I posted [here](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/23/1), the only fix needed for the infinite loop would be the loop condition here:  The more I think about it, the more I'm liking this approach. Leave the path segments unaffected and let them fail if the user uses a name that's not valid on a platform. In that way, the path `V: The New Mythology` would be valid on any platform and would fail with the appropriate error if the user tried to "open" that name on a Windows OS (same for `d:/` or `/d:/`).  The real problem, I think, is that we also want to protect against other separators, like `\` or special names like `..`.  Should zipfile.Path consider `\` as a path separator? Looking at the spec:  4.4.17.1 The name of the file, with optional relative path. The path stored MUST NOT contain a drive or device letter, or a leading slash. All slashes MUST be forward slashes '/' as opposed to backwards slashes '' for compatibility with Amiga and UNIX file systems etc.  So it seems reasonable to just treat backslashes and dots and everything else as part of the path segment and not a path separator, and let the OS fail if anything attempts to create those as files or directories in the system (e.g. `mkdir('\\')` or `open('..', 'w')`).   ---   I'm now convinced, `SanitizedNames` should be scrapped and replaced by a surgical fix for the infinite loop in the traversal. |

I think that's fine. Silently ignoring malformed paths is better than presenting them under another name and then not being able to open them. |

| AFAIK `zipfile.Path` does not provide its own interface to extract files, but any code that traverses the Path and replicates it to disk (like the `importlib` code you linked) would need to be careful to not be vulnerable to path traversal and perhaps try to gracefully handle filenames not supported by the operating system (and that would apply to any Path, not just ZIP files).  Thanks for raising this concern. I was thinking about it too, and here's my thinking:  Because of the way that `zipfile.Path` represents a tree and not a list of paths, it doesn't require sanitization. Thinking about the `importlib` code, it will start at the root (or some subpath of the zipfile), and name by name construct the dirs and files, so it will invoke `mkdir("d:")` or `open(r"Back\Path", "w")` or `open(r"..", "w")`. Those operations will succeed on platforms where that's allowed and fail where not allowed, but it never (?) has the unintended consequence of causing a user to unexpectedly traverse to a parent directory or a root folder, because each path element is encountered in order and must succeed on `mkdir` or `write_bytes` before traversing further. I'm confident but not certain that covers all of the bases. |

| I agree that *the specific code* from `importlib` is likely to be fine -- assuming `mkdir()` fails for `..` etc. on all platforms and we didn't overlook anything else. But slightly different code -- e.g. code that traverses multiple trees that may overlap and thus uses `child.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` -- can easily become vulnerable to path traversal. |

Updates `numpy` from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a
href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases\">numpy's
releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.1.0 (Aug 18, 2024)</h2>
<h1>NumPy 2.1.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>NumPy 2.1.0 provides support for the upcoming Python 3.13 release and
drops support for Python 3.9. In addition to the usual bug fixes and
updated Python support, it helps get us back into our usual release
cycle after the extended development of 2.0. The highlights for this
release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for the array-api 2023.12 standard.</li>
<li>Support for Python 3.13.</li>
<li>Preliminary support for free threaded Python 3.13.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python versions 3.10-3.13 are supported in this release.</p>
<h2>New functions</h2>
<h3>New function <code>numpy.unstack</code></h3>
<p>A new function <code>np.unstack(array, axis=...)</code> was added,
which splits an
array into a tuple of arrays along an axis. It serves as the inverse of
[numpy.stack]{.title-ref}.</p>
<p>(<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26579\">gh-26579</a>)</p>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>fix_imports</code> keyword argument in
<code>numpy.save</code> is deprecated.
Since NumPy 1.17, <code>numpy.save</code> uses a pickle protocol that no
longer
supports Python 2, and ignored <code>fix_imports</code> keyword. This
keyword
is kept only for backward compatibility. It is now deprecated.</p>
<p>(<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26452\">gh-26452</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passing non-integer inputs as the first argument of
[bincount]{.title-ref} is now deprecated, because such inputs are
silently cast to integers with no warning about loss of precision.</p>
<p>(<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27076\">gh-27076</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>

Updates `numpy` from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0
<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a
href="[https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases">numpy's](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases%22%3Enumpy%27s)
releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.1.0 (Aug 18, 2024)</h2>
<h1>NumPy 2.1.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>NumPy 2.1.0 provides support for the upcoming Python 3.13 release and
drops support for Python 3.9. In addition to the usual bug fixes and
updated Python support, it helps get us back into our usual release
cycle after the extended development of 2.0. The highlights for this
release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for the array-api 2023.12 standard.</li>
<li>Support for Python 3.13.</li>
<li>Preliminary support for free threaded Python 3.13.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python versions 3.10-3.13 are supported in this release.</p>
<h2>New functions</h2>
<h3>New function <code>numpy.unstack</code></h3>
<p>A new function <code>np.unstack(array, axis=...)</code> was added,
which splits an
array into a tuple of arrays along an axis. It serves as the inverse of
[numpy.stack]{.title-ref}.</p>
<p>(<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26579">gh-26579</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26579%22%3Egh-26579%3C/a%3E%29%3C/p)>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>fix_imports</code> keyword argument in
<code>numpy.save</code> is deprecated.
Since NumPy 1.17, <code>numpy.save</code> uses a pickle protocol that no
longer
supports Python 2, and ignored <code>fix_imports</code> keyword. This
keyword
is kept only for backward compatibility. It is now deprecated.</p>
<p>(<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26452">gh-26452</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26452%22%3Egh-26452%3C/a%3E%29%3C/p)>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passing non-integer inputs as the first argument of
[bincount]{.title-ref} is now deprecated, because such inputs are
silently cast to integers with no warning about loss of precision.</p>
<p>(<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27076">gh-27076</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27076%22%3Egh-27076%3C/a%3E%29%3C/p)>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scalars and 0D arrays are disallowed for <code>numpy.nonzero</code>
and
<code>numpy.ndarray.nonzero</code>.</p>
<p>(<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26268">gh-26268</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26268%22%3Egh-26268%3C/a%3E%29%3C/p)>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>set_string_function</code> internal function was removed and
<code>PyArray_SetStringFunction</code> was stubbed out.</p>
</li>

| Advertise that `zipfile.Path` does not do any name sanitization and it's the responsibility of the caller to check the inputs, etc.  I think documenting the caveats would be good.  zipfile.Path could provide its own traversal that could offer some safety checks.  Something like that might be nice. Though perhaps it could be more generic instead of being part of `zipfile.Path`, even if `zipfile.Path` would then perhaps provide an extraction API using that? |

Updates `setuptools` from 75.2.0 to 75.5.0
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a
href=\"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/NEWS.rst\">setuptools's
changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>v75.5.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed support for
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION</code>, as it
is deemed prone to errors. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4746\">#4746</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1>v75.4.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for the environment variable
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION=true</code>,
allowing users to bypass
the validation of <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
This option should be used only as a last resort when resolving
dependency
issues, as it may lead to improper functioning.
Users who enable this setting are responsible for ensuring that
<code>pyproject.toml</code>
complies with setuptools requirements. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4611\">#4611</a>)</p>
<p>.. attention::
This environment variable was removed in a later version of
<code>setuptools</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require Python 3.9 or later. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove dependency on <code>importlib_resources</code>
and the vendored copy of the library.
Instead, <code>setuptools</code> consistently rely on stdlib's
<code>importlib.resources</code>
(available on Python 3.9+). (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setuptools' <code>bdist_wheel</code> implementation no longer
produces wheels with
the <code>m</code> SOABI flag (pymalloc-related).
This flag was removed on Python 3.8+ (see
:obj:<code>sys.abiflags</code>). (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated vendored packaging version to 24.2. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4740\">#4740</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

<li>Merge with pypa/distutils@251797602, including fix for

<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Next release</h2>
<h3>Change to enum membership semantics</h3>
<p>As per the updated <a
href=\"https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members\">typing
specification for enums</a>,
enum members must be left unannotated.</p>
<pre lang=\"python\"><code>class Pet(Enum):
    CAT = 1  # Member attribute
    DOG = 2  # Member attribute
    WOLF: int = 3  # New error: Enum members must be left unannotated
<pre><code>species: str  # Considered a non-member attribute
</code></pre>
<p></code></pre></p>
<p>In particular, the specification change can result in issues in type
stubs (<code>.pyi</code> files), since
historically it was common to leave the value absent:</p>
<pre lang=\"python\"><code># In a type stub (.pyi file)
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# Change in semantics: previously considered members, now non-member
attributes<br />
CAT: int<br />
DOG: int</p>
<pre><code># Mypy will now issue a warning if it detects this situation
in type stubs:
# &amp;gt; Detected enum &amp;quot;Pet&amp;quot; in a type stub with
zero members.
# &amp;gt; There is a chance this is due to a recent change in the
semantics of enum membership.
# &amp;gt; If so, use `member = value` to mark an enum member, instead
of `member: type`
</code></pre>
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# As per the specification, you should now do one of the following:<br
/>
DOG = 1  # Member attribute with value 1 and known type<br />
WOLF = cast(int, ...) # Member attribute with unknown value but known
type<br />
LION = ...  # Member attribute with unknown value and unknown type<br />
</code></pre></p>

Updates `setuptools` from 75.2.0 to 75.5.0
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a
href=\"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/NEWS.rst\">setuptools's
changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>v75.5.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed support for
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION</code>, as it
is deemed prone to errors. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4746\">#4746</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1>v75.4.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for the environment variable
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION=true</code>,
allowing users to bypass
the validation of <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
This option should be used only as a last resort when resolving
dependency
issues, as it may lead to improper functioning.
Users who enable this setting are responsible for ensuring that
<code>pyproject.toml</code>
complies with setuptools requirements. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4611\">#4611</a>)</p>
<p>.. attention::
This environment variable was removed in a later version of
<code>setuptools</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require Python 3.9 or later. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove dependency on <code>importlib_resources</code>
and the vendored copy of the library.
Instead, <code>setuptools</code> consistently rely on stdlib's
<code>importlib.resources</code>
(available on Python 3.9+). (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setuptools' <code>bdist_wheel</code> implementation no longer
produces wheels with
the <code>m</code> SOABI flag (pymalloc-related).
This flag was removed on Python 3.8+ (see
:obj:<code>sys.abiflags</code>). (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718\">#4718</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated vendored packaging version to 24.2. (<a
href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4740\">#4740</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merge with pypa/distutils@251797602, including fix for
dirutil.mkpath handling in <a

<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Next release</h2>
<h3>Change to enum membership semantics</h3>
<p>As per the updated <a
href=\"https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members\">typing
specification for enums</a>,
enum members must be left unannotated.</p>
<pre lang=\"python\"><code>class Pet(Enum):
    CAT = 1  # Member attribute
    DOG = 2  # Member attribute
    WOLF: int = 3  # New error: Enum members must be left unannotated
<pre><code>species: str  # Considered a non-member attribute
</code></pre>
<p></code></pre></p>
<p>In particular, the specification change can result in issues in type
stubs (<code>.pyi</code> files), since
historically it was common to leave the value absent:</p>
<pre lang=\"python\"><code># In a type stub (.pyi file)
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# Change in semantics: previously considered members, now non-member
attributes<br />
CAT: int<br />
DOG: int</p>
<pre><code># Mypy will now issue a warning if it detects this situation
in type stubs:
# &amp;gt; Detected enum &amp;quot;Pet&amp;quot; in a type stub with
zero members.
# &amp;gt; There is a chance this is due to a recent change in the
semantics of enum membership.
# &amp;gt; If so, use `member = value` to mark an enum member, instead
of `member: type`
</code></pre>
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# As per the specification, you should now do one of the following:<br
/>
DOG = 1  # Member attribute with value 1 and known type<br />
WOLF = cast(int, ...) # Member attribute with unknown value but known
type<br />
LION = ...  # Member attribute with unknown value and unknown type<br />
</code></pre></p>

<blockquote>
<h1>v75.5.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed support for
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION</code>, as it
is deemed prone to errors. (<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4746">#4746</a>)</li](https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4746%22%3E#4746</a>)</li)>
</ul>
<h1>v75.4.0</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for the environment variable
<code>SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION=true</code>,
allowing users to bypass
the validation of <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
This option should be used only as a last resort when resolving
dependency
issues, as it may lead to improper functioning.
Users who enable this setting are responsible for ensuring that
<code>pyproject.toml</code>
complies with setuptools requirements. (<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4611">#4611</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4611%22%3E#4611</a>)</p)>
<p>.. attention::
This environment variable was removed in a later version of
<code>setuptools</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require Python 3.9 or later. (<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718">#4718</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718%22%3E#4718</a>)</p)>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove dependency on <code>importlib_resources</code>
and the vendored copy of the library.
Instead, <code>setuptools</code> consistently rely on stdlib's
<code>importlib.resources</code>
(available on Python 3.9+). (<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718">#4718</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718%22%3E#4718</a>)</p)>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setuptools' <code>bdist_wheel</code> implementation no longer
produces wheels with
the <code>m</code> SOABI flag (pymalloc-related).
This flag was removed on Python 3.8+ (see
:obj:<code>sys.abiflags</code>). (<a
href="[https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718">#4718</a>)</p](https://redirect.github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4718%22%3E#4718</a>)</p)>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated vendored packaging version to 24.2. (<a

Updates `mypy` from 1.12.1 to 1.13.0

<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Next release</h2>
<h3>Change to enum membership semantics</h3>
<p>As per the updated <a
href="<https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members">typing>
specification for enums</a>,
enum members must be left unannotated.</p>
<pre lang="python"><code>class Pet(Enum):
    CAT = 1  # Member attribute
    DOG = 2  # Member attribute
    WOLF: int = 3  # New error: Enum members must be left unannotated
<pre><code>species: str  # Considered a non-member attribute
</code></pre>
<p></code></pre></p>
<p>In particular, the specification change can result in issues in type
stubs (<code>.pyi</code> files), since
historically it was common to leave the value absent:</p>
<pre lang="python"><code># In a type stub (.pyi file)
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# Change in semantics: previously considered members, now non-member
attributes<br />
CAT: int<br />
DOG: int</p>
<pre><code># Mypy will now issue a warning if it detects this situation
in type stubs:
# &amp;gt; Detected enum &amp;quot;Pet&amp;quot; in a type stub with
zero members.
# &amp;gt; There is a chance this is due to a recent change in the
semantics of enum membership.
# &amp;gt; If so, use `member = value` to mark an enum member, instead
of `member: type`
</code></pre>
<p>class Pet(Enum):<br />
# As per the specification, you should now do one of the following:<br
/>
DOG = 1  # Member attribute with value 1 and known type<br />
WOLF = cast(int, ...) # Member attribute with unknown value but known
type<br />
LION = ...  # Member attribute with unknown value and unknown type<br />
</code></pre></p>
