Subject: CPython: CVE-2024-8088: Infinite loop when iterating over zip archive
 entry names

-------- Forwarded Message --------
Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-8088] Infinite loop when iterating over
zip archive entry names

There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile" module.

When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods of
"zipfile.ZipFile" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", "extractall()", etc) the
process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted zip archive.
This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting the contents of the
zip archive. Programs that are not handling user-controlled zip archives are not
affected.

Please see the linked CVE ID for the latest information on affected versions:

* <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8088>
* <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122906>
* <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122905>
