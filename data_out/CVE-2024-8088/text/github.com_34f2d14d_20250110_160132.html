| I've proposed the backport to 3.11. I'm hoping to cherrypick that to 3.10 and earlier, assuming it's accepted, rather that cherry-picking the change in main and re-reconciling the conflicts. |

| That's weird - all three backports (3.8, 3.9, 3.10) are failing on the macos runners, two of them with segmentation faults. I'm 99.9% certain these changes aren't directly implicated. I've restarted the runners to see if maybe that clears things up, but there seems to be some stability issues on those branches. |
