Based on the provided content, this is a bug report and discussion about a PHP error encountered in pnp4nagios when using PHP 8. The issue is related to the removal of the `MB_OVERLOAD_STRING` constant in PHP 8, which is used in pnp4nagios code. This is not a security vulnerability.

Specifically, the following points can be extracted:

*   **Root cause of the issue:** The root cause of the issue is the usage of the `MB_OVERLOAD_STRING` constant in the pnp4nagios codebase, which is no longer defined in PHP 8. This is due to changes in the PHP language itself, not a coding error per se in the pnp4nagios application. The constant `MB_OVERLOAD_STRING` was used with `ini_get('mbstring.func_overload')` to check for the usage of mbstring function overloading.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  There is no software vulnerability. This is a software incompatibility issue.
*   **Impact of the issue:** The impact is a fatal PHP error, causing pnp4nagios to fail when running under PHP 8. Specifically, the error is `Undefined constant "MB_OVERLOAD_STRING"`. This prevents the application from functioning correctly. The impact includes `Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Undefined constant "MB_OVERLOAD_STRING"`.
*   **Attack vectors:**  There is no attack vector. This issue is triggered by normal execution of the pnp4nagios application on a PHP 8 environment.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not applicable, there are no attackers involved. This is an incompatibility issue with the PHP version.

This content describes an application incompatibility problem due to a breaking change in PHP 8, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
