[[details]](attachment.cgi?id=411852&action=edit "the POC file.") the POC file.  Hi, developers of NASM: I tested the binary ndisasm with my fuzzer, and a crash incurred, i.e., Stack-buffer-overflow error. The version of NASM is the latest (the newest master branch in github (<https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm.git>), version: NASM version 2.16rc0 compiled on Sep 20 2022) and the operation system is Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (docker). The following is the details.   root@1312a373d471:/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm# ./ndisasm ../out/crashes/id\:000011\,sig\:06\,src\:000341\,op\:havoc\,rep\:4\,701855 00000000  46                inc si 00000001  53                push bx 00000002  0002              add [bp+si],al 00000004  00B3B3B3          add [bp+di-0x4c4d],dh 00000008  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000000A  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000000C  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000000E  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000010  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000012  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000014  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000016  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000018  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000001A  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000001C  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 0000001E  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000020  B3B3              mov bl,0xb3 00000022  B300              mov bl,0x0 00000024  3E3E3E3E3E3E3E3E  ds pop bx          -3E3E3E3E3E3E3E3E          -3E3E3E3E3E3E3E3E          -3E3E3E3E5B 00000041  5B                pop bx 00000042  5C                pop sp 00000043  3E3E3E4F          ds dec di ================================================================= ==887807==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7ffd3ffea120 at pc 0x00000041338c bp 0x7ffd3ffe8610 sp 0x7ffd3ffe8608 READ of size 1 at 0x7ffd3ffea120 thread T0     #0 0x41338b in disasm (/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm/ndisasm+0x41338b)     #1 0x40c89c in main (/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm/ndisasm+0x40c89c)     #2 0x7f6308e6ec86 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21c86)     #3 0x406759 in _start (/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm/ndisasm+0x406759)  Address 0x7ffd3ffea120 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 96 in frame     #0 0x406a8f in main (/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm/ndisasm+0x406a8f)    This frame has 6 object(s):     [32, 96) 'buffer' <== Memory access at offset 96 overflows this variable     [128, 136) 'ep'     [160, 416) 'outbuf'     [480, 484) 'synclen'     [496, 516) 'prefer'     [560, 561) 'rn_error' HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork       (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported) SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow (/fuzz-nasm/ndisasm/ndisasm+0x41338b) in disasm Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x100027ff53d0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff53e0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff53f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff5400: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff5410: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f1 f1 f1 f1 00 00 00 00 =>0x100027ff5420: 00 00 00 00[f2]f2 f2 f2 00 f2 f2 f2 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff5430: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff5440: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f2 f2 f2 f2   0x100027ff5450: f2 f2 f2 f2 04 f2 00 00 04 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 01 f3   0x100027ff5460: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x100027ff5470: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==887807==ABORTING    I uploaded the POC in the attachment.
