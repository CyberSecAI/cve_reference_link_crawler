The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46979.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a double free in the Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The ioctl handlers are being freed twice. First during `iio_device_unregister()`, and then again within `iio_device_unregister_eventset()` and `iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: The double free leads to a kernel panic, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unregistering an IIO device: The vulnerability is triggered when an IIO device is unregistered. The specific steps and conditions to trigger the double free during unregistration are within the IIO subsystem's logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the unregistration of an IIO device. This would typically require local access or specific permissions within the system.
