  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MCA (Machine Check Architecture) code could not recover from in-kernel #MC (Machine Check) exceptions when the fixup type was EX_TYPE_DEFAULT, which resulted in a kernel panic. This happened because a previous commit replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get,put}_user() fixups.  _ASM_EXTABLE() uses the EX_TYPE_DEFAULT fixup type, whereas _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() uses EX_TYPE_UACCESS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect exception handling",
       "Incorrect fixup type for memory access operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel panic during memory error injection tests or similar scenarios where in-kernel MCEs (Machine Check Exceptions) occur when accessing user space memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "Memory error injection, hardware faults leading to machine check exceptions when the kernel tries to access user space memory.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to induce memory errors or hardware faults that trigger machine check exceptions while the kernel is attempting to access userspace memory."
