Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the `Master.php` file of the `php-ocls` application, specifically in the `pay_order` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, financial records, or other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete existing data within the database, potentially causing significant damage or disruption to the application's functionality and data integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `id` parameter in the `Master.php?f=pay_order` URL. This suggests the `id` is used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable software is identified as `php-ocls<=v1.0`.
*   The source code is linked to a specific SourceCodester page, indicating a publicly available application.
*   A GitHub repository contains more information, which may contain the actual exploit.
