Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-34868

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a broken access control issue, specifically a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. This is a classic example of a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not verify user permissions before executing certain functions.
- **Missing Authentication:** The plugin might not properly authenticate users, leading to actions executed by unauthorized users.
- **Missing Nonce Token Check:** The plugin might lack CSRF protection, allowing malicious actors to execute unauthorized actions via CSRF attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to perform actions they are not supposed to, gaining unauthorized access to functionality or data. The specific impact would depend on the functions that are vulnerable but could include:
    - Modifying plugin settings.
    - Accessing sensitive information.
    - Performing unauthorized actions within the plugin's scope.
    - Taking over the website by further compromising other components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- An attacker would need to identify the specific functions that are missing access control checks.
- The attacker would then craft malicious requests to execute these vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be a subscriber or have an account on the WordPress site, which implies they don't need high privileges to start with.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of how the vulnerable plugin functions, specifically the vulnerable areas of the plugin code.
- The attacker would likely need to craft a specific request to bypass the missing checks.
