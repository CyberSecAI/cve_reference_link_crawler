- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for elevated functionality when guessing credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to other network devices.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access (AV:P) and does not require user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to guess credentials and have physical access to the device. The attacker does not need privileges initially (PR:N).
