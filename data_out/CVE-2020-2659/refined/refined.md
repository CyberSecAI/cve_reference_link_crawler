Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-2659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incomplete enforcement of the `maxDatagramSockets` limit** within the `DatagramChannelImpl` class of OpenJDK. This suggests that the implementation does not properly restrict the number of datagram sockets that can be created, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Enforcement of Resource Limits**: The core weakness is the failure to properly enforce the `maxDatagramSockets` limit, which is intended to restrict the number of datagram sockets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: By exploiting this incomplete enforcement, an attacker can potentially create an excessive number of datagram sockets, leading to resource exhaustion (e.g. memory exhaustion) and subsequent denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network**: Since datagram sockets are used for network communication, an attacker would likely exploit this vulnerability by creating a high number of datagram sockets via network-based attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access**: The attacker needs to be able to initiate network communication that leads to the creation of datagram sockets, and therefore must have network access to the target system.
*   **Ability to make a large number of requests**:  An attacker needs to be capable of making a large number of requests or otherwise trigger the creation of datagram sockets.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content shows that the vulnerability affects the OpenJDK implementation in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Debian packages of different versions. This means the vulnerability is not limited to a specific operating system, but rather exists within the OpenJDK library which is packaged into multiple OS.
*   The fixes involve updating OpenJDK packages to versions containing the corrected code, which properly enforces the `maxDatagramSockets` limit.
*   Restarting Java processes is often required to apply the update.
*   This CVE is often bundled with other Java related vulnerabilities in security advisories.

In summary, CVE-2020-2659 is a vulnerability within OpenJDK's `DatagramChannelImpl` class related to incomplete enforcement of socket limits, allowing for a potential DoS via the creation of excessive datagram sockets. The fix is a software update to the affected OpenJDK packages.
