Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**1. Buffer Overflow in `Virtual_Data_Check`**

*   **Root cause:** The `Virtual_Data_Check` function uses `sscanf` with format string `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s` to parse an input string. The input string is read from the "list" parameter, which can be up to 0x200 bytes long via `websSafeGetVar`. The `%[^,]` specifier reads characters until a comma is encountered, while `%s` reads until whitespace. However, there are no bounds checks on the sizes of the destination buffers (`local_168`, `local_138`, `local_128`, `local_118`). If the input string exceeds these buffer sizes, a buffer overflow occurs.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unbounded string copy via `sscanf` format specifiers `%[^,]` and `%s` without proper validation of the length of the input string.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Buffer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
    *   Possible command injection if crafted input overwrites critical parts of the stack.
    *   Denial of service due to program crash.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetVirtualServerCfg` with a `list` parameter that contains a comma-separated string with values exceeding the buffer sizes allocated for the local variables within the `Virtual_Data_Check` function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target device's web interface.
    *   No prior authentication appears to be required.

**2. Buffer Overflow in `route_static_check`**

*   **Root cause:** Similar to the previous vulnerability, `route_static_check` uses `sscanf` with the same format string `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s` to parse input from the `list` parameter which can be up to 0x200 bytes long. Again, there are no checks on the size of the data being written into local variables (`local_4c`, `local_3c`, `local_2c`, `local_1c`).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unbounded string copy via `sscanf` format specifiers `%[^,]` and `%s`, leading to buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Buffer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
    *  Possible command injection due to overwriting of stack data.
    *   Denial of service due to program crash.
    *  Potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` with a `list` parameter that contains a comma-separated string with values exceeding the buffer sizes allocated for the local variables within the `route_static_check` function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target device's web interface.
    *   No prior authentication appears to be required.

**3. Possible Buffer Overflow in `fromSysToolChangePwd`**

*   **Root cause:** The `fromSysToolChangePwd` function retrieves a new password from the `SYSPS` parameter using `websGetVar` without any length limit. Later, when this function is called again, the `GetValue` function reads the current password into a local buffer (`local_2c`). Because the previous call potentially set a very large password, this could lead to a buffer overflow in this local variable, when reading from the persistent storage.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unbounded string copy from persistent storage to a local buffer without proper validation of the length of the stored password.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Buffer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
    *  Possible command injection due to overwriting of stack data.
    *   Denial of service due to program crash.
    *  Potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    1. Send a request to `/goform/SysToolChangePwd` setting a new password via the `SYSPS` parameter to a very large string.
    2. Send another request to the same endpoint. The current password will be fetched from the configuration which is the long password from the first request. This results in a buffer overflow when copying to a local variable.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
     * The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target device's web interface.
     * The attacker must have knowledge of the device's current password.
     * It's implied that authentication as a valid user is required to set the initial password.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**
The document describes three potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities affecting the `httpd` binary of the Tenda AC10 v4 router. The first two involve the usage of `sscanf` with unbounded format specifiers in `Virtual_Data_Check` and `route_static_check`. The third is in `fromSysToolChangePwd` and is caused by reading a potentially oversized password from persistent storage to a stack variable. All three are potentially exploitable by sending crafted HTTP POST requests, and could lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution.
