**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4366

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Spectra â€“ WordPress Gutenberg Blocks plugin

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.13.0

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `block_id` parameter within the Spectra plugin. This allows malicious scripts to be injected into the page data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Lack of proper sanitization of the `block_id` parameter before storing it.
-  Lack of proper output escaping when rendering the `block_id` parameter in the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
-  When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the malicious script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Redirection to malicious sites
    -  Data theft
    -  Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be exploited through the `block_id` parameter.
-  Attackers need to inject malicious scripts using this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least author-level permissions.
