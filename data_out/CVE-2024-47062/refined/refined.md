The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47062.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application automatically adds URL parameters to SQL queries without proper sanitization. This occurs in three distinct ways:
1.  URL parameters are included in SQL `LIKE` statements, enabling information leakage.
2.  URL parameter names are not escaped, allowing for SQL injection.
3.  Usernames used in a `LIKE` statement during authentication permit logins using wildcard characters like `%`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **ORM Leak:**  Parameters passed in the URL are used in SQL LIKE statements, potentially exposing sensitive information by allowing partial string matches.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Parameter names from the URL are directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3.  **Authentication Weakness:**  The use of a `LIKE` operator in the username lookup allows users to log in with wildcard characters, bypassing authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **ORM Leak:** Attackers can potentially retrieve arbitrary information, including sensitive data like password fragments, by exploiting the SQL `LIKE` statement behavior.
2.  **SQL Injections:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to database compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
3.  **Authentication Weakness:**  Attackers can bypass authentication by using the wildcard `%` as a username.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve crafting malicious HTTP GET requests that include specific parameters in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Attackers require a network connection to the vulnerable application and need to craft malicious URLs. They require low privileges to exploit the vulnerability and no user interaction is required.
