SSA-222019: X\_T File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Parasolid

| Publication Date: | 2024-04-09 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-04-09 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Parasolid is affected by out of bounds read, stack exhaustion and null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in X\_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Do not open untrusted XT files in Parasolid

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling, direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-26275

The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted X\_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-26276

The affected application contains a stack exhaustion vulnerability while parsing a specially crafted X\_T file. This could allow an attacker to cause denial of service condition.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 3.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-26277

The affected applications contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability while parsing specially crafted X\_T files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial of service condition.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 3.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
