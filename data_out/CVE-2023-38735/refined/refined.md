Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reverse tabnabbing issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of a reverse tabnabbing vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when a website opens a new tab or window to a different website, and the new website is able to manipulate the original tab/window via the `window.opener` object. If the original tab/window did not set `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` on the link, the newly opened page could potentially redirect the original page to a malicious URL, leading to a phishing attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to redirect a user's original tab/window to a malicious website. This could lead to various attacks including phishing, session hijacking, and potentially other forms of malware injection or account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a user clicking on a link that opens a new tab or window. The attacker then controls the newly opened page and uses it to manipulate the original window through the `window.opener` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a page that is opened in a new tab or window by a vulnerable application. This often means that the attacker must be able to inject code into the linked website or redirect the link to a page under their control. The user must interact with the vulnerable application by clicking a link or performing an action that triggers the opening of a new tab/window with the vulnerable `window.opener`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in IBM Cognos Dashboards on Cloud Pak for Data version 4.7.0
- The fix for the vulnerability involves upgrading Cognos Dashboards to a later 4.7 refresh.
- The provided content does not specify the exact location of the vulnerable code that results in the `window.opener` not being secured and allows for reverse tabnabbing.
