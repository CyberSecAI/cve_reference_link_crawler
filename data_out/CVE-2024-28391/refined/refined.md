Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SQL parameters in multiple methods within the "Quick Order Form - Order Table" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module fails to properly escape or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core issue is SQL injection. Several methods in the `QuickProductTableFmmQuickModuleFrontController` and `QuickProductTableAjaxModuleFrontController` classes directly incorporate unsanitized user input into SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   Vulnerable methods:
        *   `QuickProductTableFmmQuickModuleFrontController::readCsv()`
        *  `QuickProductTableAjaxModuleFrontController::displayAjaxProductChangeAttr`
        * `QuickProductTableAjaxModuleFrontController::displayAjaxProductAddToCart`
        * `QuickProductTableAjaxModuleFrontController::getSearchProducts`
        * `QuickProductTableAjaxModuleFrontController::displayAjaxProductSku`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Impact**: The vulnerability has a critical severity rating (9.8) due to the potential for:
    *   Gaining admin access to the PrestaShop instance.
    *   Deleting or modifying data within the database.
    *   Copying sensitive information from the database, including tokens, which could be used to unlock admin ajax scripts
    *   Rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Forged CSV:** One of the exploitation methods uses a crafted CSV file, which can bypass most Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
*   **Front Controller Exploitation**: The exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller, making it difficult to detect with standard frontend logs as the requests will appear as "POST /".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system.
*   **No User Interaction Required**: The attacker can execute the exploit without requiring user interaction.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge**: The attacker needs to send HTTP requests, but no specific complex skills are required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided patch shows that the fix involves casting the variables to integers using `(int)`, using `array_map('intval', $id_attributes)`, and using `pSQL()` function to sanitize the variables before using them in SQL queries.
*   The advisory mentions that simply upgrading to the latest version of PrestaShop won't prevent SQL injection attacks that use `UNION` clauses.
*   The advisory also highlights the importance of using the `pSQL` function provided by PrestaShop to prevent stored XSS.

In summary, CVE-2024-28391 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "Quick Order Form - Order Table" PrestaShop module that allows unauthenticated attackers to potentially take over the affected system. The vulnerability is caused by improper input sanitization in multiple methods within the module.
