The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's AMD display driver, specifically within the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) module.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code was reading 8 bytes of the BKSV (receiver's public key certificate) field, while the actual target field size was 5 bytes. This over-read could lead to reading data beyond the intended boundary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `memcpy` was reading beyond the 5-byte boundary of the `hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv` field, potentially accessing adjacent memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data corruption:** If the trailing 3 bytes read by the over-read were non-zero, the resulting `u64` value would be corrupted. This corruption of the BKSV could lead to incorrect HDCP validation and functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the HDCP module processes the `hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv` field. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to initiate or manipulate an HDCP exchange, in order to provide a crafted `bksv` value.
- No specific privilege is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The original code used `memcpy(&n, hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv, sizeof(uint64_t));` which would copy 8 bytes into `n`. This has been fixed with `u8 bksv[sizeof(n)] = { };` which initializes an 8-byte buffer and then copying `memcpy(bksv, hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv, sizeof(hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv));`, where `sizeof(hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv)` is 5, thus copying only 5 bytes. `n = *(uint64_t *)bksv;` then reads the content as a 64bit integer.
