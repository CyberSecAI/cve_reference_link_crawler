In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Avoid HDCP over-read and corruption

Instead of reading the desired 5 bytes of the actual target field,
the code was reading 8. This could result in a corrupted value if the
trailing 3 bytes were non-zero, so instead use an appropriately sized
and zero-initialized bounce buffer, and read only 5 bytes before casting
to u64.
