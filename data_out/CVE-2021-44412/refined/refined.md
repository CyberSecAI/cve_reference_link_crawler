- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser in Reolink RLC-410W devices improperly handles JSON parameters, specifically when a string is provided instead of a JSON object for the "param" field. The code assumes that the "param" field will always be a JSON object and tries to access it using the subscription operator. This leads to an assertion failure and subsequently a device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The JSON parser lacks proper validation to ensure that the provided parameters are of the expected type (JSON object).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the device to reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint, including a JSON array in the body. This array contains a command where the "param" field is not a JSON object, but a string (e.g., an empty string).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. This could be done by being on the same network, or by having access to the device's external IP address if exposed. While most of the vulnerable API calls require a valid session token, it's noted that an unauthenticated user can exploit these vulnerabilities in conjunction with TALOS-2021-1420.
- **CVE-2021-44412**: Specifically, this CVE refers to the vulnerability related to the `GetRec` command, where providing a string as the value for the `param` key results in the device rebooting.
