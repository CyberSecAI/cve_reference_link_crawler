# SQUID-2024:3 Denial of Service in ESI processing

Moderate

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-wgvf-q977-9xjg
Jun 25, 2024

## Package

squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

3.0 - 6.9

## Patched versions

6.10

## Description

### Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2024:3

---

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory ID: | SQUID-2024:3 |
| Date: | Jun 10, 2024 |
| Summary: | Denial of Service in ESI processing |
| Affected versions: | Squid 3.0 -> 3.5.28 |
|  | Squid 4.0 -> 4.16 |
|  | Squid 5.0 -> 5.9 |
|  | Squid 6.0 -> 6.9 |
| Fixed in version: | Squid 6.10 |

---

### Problem Description:

Due to an Out-of-bounds Write error when assigning ESI variables,

Squid is susceptible to a Memory Corruption error, which can

result in a Denial of Service.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a trusted server to perform a Denial of Service attack on

Squid while processing ESI response content.

This affects all domains being serviced by the proxy and all clients using

it during the affected period.

The trigger for this issue are values which clients might normally expect to use

in valid ESI response content. As such admin should expect this issue to be

already occurring without any malicious 0-day attack existing.

This issue is limited to Squid acting as reverse proxy where ESI feature has been

enabled at build time

CVSS Score of 6.3

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.10.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 3.x, 4, or 5:

<https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/f411fe7d75197852f0e5ee85027a06d58dd8df4c.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.

All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not

vulnerable.

All Squid-3.x versions built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.9 built with --enable-esi

are vulnerable

---

### Workaround:

Build Squid with --disable-esi

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
