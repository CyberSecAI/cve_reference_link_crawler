Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23645

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the reports pages of GLPI. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the URL parameters, specifically date parameters, which are then reflected back in the HTML output of the report pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Reflected XSS:**  The application fails to sanitize and encode user-controlled parameters within the URL. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting a specific URL containing the malicious payload.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Input validation and output encoding are not properly implemented in the reporting functionality, leaving it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL, within the context of the vulnerable GLPI application.
* **Confidentiality Impact:** As mentioned, the impact is high for confidentiality. The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect to malicious sites, which means they could potentially steal sensitive information. 
* **Integrity and Availability Impact:** Although the integrity and availability impact are rated as None, the impact could be extended to this category depending on the intention of the attacker. 

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attacker can deliver the malicious URL over a network.
* **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricks a user into clicking it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges on the GLPI system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim must interact with the malicious URL for the attack to succeed (e.g. by clicking the link).
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL parameters, such as `date1`, `date2` and others that are not properly sanitized.

**Additional Information:**

* **Affected Versions:** GLPI versions 0.65 and above are affected.
* **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI version 10.0.12.
* **Workaround:** A workaround is to remove read rights on reports for all profiles to prevent the exploitation.
* **Fix:** The fix involves sanitizing the input and encoding special characters in the URL parameters, which are then used to generate links and forms on the report pages. This is done using the `Toolbox::append_params` and `htmlspecialchars` methods, preventing the injected code from being interpreted as executable JavaScript.
* The commit messages,  "Encode special chars in stats forms/links" and "Sanitize parameters and encode special chars" are related to this fix.
