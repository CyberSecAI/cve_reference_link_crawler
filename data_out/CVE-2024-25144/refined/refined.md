- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IFrame widget in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not validate the URL of the IFrame. This allows an attacker to create a self-referencing IFrame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of URL validation in the IFrame widget.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated user can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by creating a self-referencing IFrame, which likely leads to resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote authenticated user can insert a crafted IFrame element with a self-referencing URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Liferay Portal or DXP and have the ability to create/modify IFrame widgets.
