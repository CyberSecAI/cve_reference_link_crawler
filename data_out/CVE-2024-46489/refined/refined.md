```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows loading prompt/template files from URLs. If an attacker controls the prompt/template, they can inject malicious commands that can be executed by the application's function calling mechanism, which in turn can be used to modify files on the user's server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unvalidated URL loading of prompt/template files",
    "Lack of input validation on the content of the prompt/template files",
    "Insecure function calling mechanism which performs file system operations based on the content of the prompt"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary file modification on the user's server. For example, writing to arbitrary files, including potentially sensitive ones.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can control a remote URL and host a malicious prompt/template file which is then loaded by the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a web server where they can host a malicious prompt/template file accessible via HTTP or HTTPS. The victim must be tricked into using the application with the attacker-controlled URL."
