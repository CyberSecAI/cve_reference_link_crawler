**Root Cause:** The Arya Multipurpose Pro WordPress theme, in versions up to and including 1.0.8, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The theme does not properly sanitize user input or data before displaying it on the website, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The injected scripts are executed when users visit the compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, indicating the vulnerability can be exploited by anyone.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable theme. The exact method is not specified, but it likely involves exploiting an area of the website where unsanitized input is displayed.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1, indicating a medium severity.
