Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists within the installer of certain Zoom Apps and SDKs for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The installer process is susceptible to a race condition, where the outcome of the process depends on the timing of events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access to the system than initially authorized.
- **Limited Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on integrity (`I:L`), suggesting the attacker might not be able to fully manipulate data, but can modify it to some extent.
- **Limited Availability Impact:** Similarly, the low impact on availability (`A:L`) indicates the attacker might disrupt the service, but not fully bring it down.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, meaning they need valid user credentials.
- **User Interaction:** The exploit requires some form of user interaction (`UI:R`) meaning the user needs to be tricked to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have legitimate user credentials on the targeted Windows system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the Zoom installer process to trigger the race condition.
- The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Affected Products:**
- Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Rooms App for Windows before version 6.0.0
- Zoom Meeting SDK for Windows before version 6.0.0

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.4, which is considered a medium severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by sim0nsecurity.
- Users are advised to update to version 6.0.0 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
