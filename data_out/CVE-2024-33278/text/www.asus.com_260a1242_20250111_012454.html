05/24/2021 **Security advisory for FragAttack** ∇

Associated CVE: CVE-2020-24588, CVE-2020-26146, CVE-2020-24587

Severity: Medium

ASUS is aware of newly discovered industry-wide WiFi protocol vulnerabilities that affect every brand of WiFi router. The vulnerabilities are known as Fragmentation and Aggregation Attacks (commonly called Frag Attacks). WiFi devices using the WEP, WPA, WPA2 or WPA3 encryption schemes are affected. FragAttacks can be used to silently steal data, and they can also lead to other exploits.

Please note that an attacker needs to be connected to your WiFi network in order to exploit these vulnerabilities, so they need to be within WiFi signal range and know your WiFi password.

ASUS is working round the clock to release firmware fixes for these vulnerabilities.

Security advisory for DNSpooq

CVE: CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25782, CVE-2020-25683, CVE-2020-25684, CVE-2020-25685, CVE-2020-25686, CVE-2020-25687

Severity: Medium

Abstract

This quick-patch beta firmware was released on February 2, 2021. The first model-specific regular firmware update has just been released, and other models are scheduled to follow in the near future. The beta firmware requires users to perform a manual update.

Products from over 40 companies, including ASUS routers, are affected by DNSpooq.

There are two sets of vulnerabilities.

* Buffer-overflow vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25683, CVE-2020-25687
* DNS cache-poisoning vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-25684, CVE-2020-25685, CVE-2020-25686

No ASUS routers are affected by CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25683, CVE-2020-25687, because these vulnerabilities only affect DNSSEC.

ASUS routers are only affected by DNS cache-poisoning vulnerabilities, with medium severity. All these vulnerabilities can be fixed by updating to the new firmware.

06/08/2018 **Security advisory for VPNFilter malware** ∇

Talos Intelligence recently discovered that VPNFilter is targeting more makes and models than initial release, and the following ASUS routers may be potential targets:

RT-AC66U

RT-N10 (EOL)

RT-N10E (EOL)

RT-N10U (EOL)

RT-N56U (EOL)

RT-N66U

To help owners of these routers take necessary precautions, we compiled a security checklist:

(1) Reset the device to factory default: Hold the Reset button in the rear for at least five seconds until the power LED starts blinking.

(2) Update all devices to the latest firmware.

(3) Ensure default admin password had been changed to a more secure one.

(4) Disable Remote Management (disabled by default, can only be enabled via Advanced Settings).

(5) Enable the URL filter in the Advanced Settings -> Firewall. Set the Filter table type as Black List. Add the "photobucket" and "toknowall" in the URL filter list.

For any users with the EOL models listed above, we strongly advise upgrading to a router with [AiProtection](https://www.asus.com/AiProtection/). A wide selection of ASUS and ROG routers offer AiProtection powered by Trend Micro™. Anytime a threat is detected, the connection between your device and the malicious server is blocked before any personal data is compromised. The list of malicious servers is constantly updated by syncing with the Trend Micro cloud database automatically, to ensure your network environment is secure around the clock.

10/18/2017 **Security advisory for the vulnerabilities of WPA2 protocol** ∇

ASUS is aware of the recent WPA2 vulnerability issue. We take your security and privacy seriously and are currently working towards a full solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we want to help clarify the severity of the potential threat, and let our valued customers know the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid or lessen the threat of being compromised.

Your devices are only vulnerable if an attacker is in physical proximity to your wireless network and is able to gain access to it. This exploit cannot steal your banking information, passwords, or other data on a secured connection that utilizes proper end-to-end encryption. However, an attacker could capture and read this information on an unsecured connection via an exploited WiFi network. Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible for the attacker to redirect network traffic, send invalid data to devices or even inject malware into the network.

We are feverishly working with chipset suppliers to resolve this vulnerability and will release patched firmware for affected routers in the near future. Before this patched firmware is released, here are a few cautions all users should take:

(1) Avoid public Wi-Fi and Hotspots until the routers and your devices are updated. Use cellular network connections if possible.

(2) Only connect to secured services that you trust or have been verified. Web pages that use HTTPS or another secure connection will include HTTPS in the URL. If the connection is secured using TLS 1.2 your activities with that service is safe for now.

(3) Keep your operating system and antivirus software up-to-date. Microsoft recently updated Windows to fix this exploit on their latest operating systems. Google and Apple are following suit shortly.

(4) When in doubt, be safe and use your cellular network or a wired connection (Ethernet) to access the internet. This exploit only affects 802.11 traffic between a Wi-Fi router and a connected device on an exploited WiFi connection.
