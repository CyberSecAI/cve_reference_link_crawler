Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40005:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an authenticated command injection vulnerability present in the web server of the Intelbras WiFiber 120AC inMesh device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The web server is vulnerable to command injection. Specifically, it is vulnerable via POST parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full access to the underlying operating system of the device, potentially leading to:
  - Complete control of the device.
  - More extensive damage in the corresponding network if the device is acting as a key device in an industrial network.
  - Execution of arbitrary commands such as opening a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the web server of the device.
- Specifically, the parameters `pingAddr` in `/boaform/formPing6` and `traceAddr` in `/boaform/formTracert` are vulnerable to command injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the device's web server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was verified on an emulated device using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.
- The proof of concept demonstrates injection of commands like "ls /" and establishing a reverse shell.
- The vulnerable firmware version is `1.1-220216` and the fixed version is `1-1-220826`.
- The vendor, Intelbras, was notified, and a firmware update was released to address the vulnerability.
