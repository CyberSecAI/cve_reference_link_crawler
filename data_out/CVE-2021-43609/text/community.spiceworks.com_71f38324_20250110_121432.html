We have released a security patch for Help Desk Server (HDS).

Upgrading users can get the patch by upgrading normally, and will receive v1.3.2. Brand new installations of HDS will download v1.3.3 which is identical to v1.3.2 (contains the same security patch).

The process for upgrading to the newest version will automatically cycle your installation’s secrets (as usual for upgrades). We’ve also updated our [documentation](https://community.spiceworks.com/support/help-desk-server/docs/setup#secure-your-installation) to note that you should periodically cycle secrets as a best practice.

Is it just a security update, no new features or enhancements to existing ones?

Anyone else having issues updating to this new version? I have a issue at the moment where I can’t validate new users and hoping a upgrade might clear out whatever is causing the issue.

I noticed yesterday that v1.3.4 is now available but I don’t see any release notes for that version. Will those be posted soon?
