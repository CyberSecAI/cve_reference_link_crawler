Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-43609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `order_by_for_ticket` function within the `reporting/database_query.rb` file of the Spiceworks Help Desk Server application.
- The function is vulnerable because it directly incorporates user-controlled `order` and `dir` parameters into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Blind Boolean SQL injection. An attacker can control the `ORDER BY` clause of a SQL query, which is used to sort tickets in the Spiceworks application. This allows for arbitrary SQL execution within the database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the 'sort' parameter, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Information Disclosure:** Through the SQL injection, an attacker can use the `pg_read_file` command to read arbitrary files on the server, including the environment configuration file containing the `secret_key_base`.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** After obtaining the `secret_key_base`, an attacker can craft malicious serialized cookies, leading to RCE by deserializing the crafted payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files with credentials, private keys etc.
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database by using the SQL injection to extract data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/tickets` endpoint, which takes the `sort` parameter.
- **SQL Injection Payload:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `sort` parameter, exploiting the vulnerability in the `order_by_for_ticket` function.
- **Cookie Deserialization:** The RCE is achieved by crafting and sending a malicious signed cookie after obtaining the `secret_key_base` via SQL injection

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Spiceworks Help Desk Server instance.
- **Authentication (Admin or Agent):** The attacker must be an authenticated user (either an admin or an agent), as the /api/tickets endpoint is only available to logged-in users.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know to target the `sort` parameter and how to inject a SQL payload.
- **Knowledge of Ruby on Rails Deserialization:** To achieve RCE the attacker needs knowledge of how to exploit the Rails deserialization functionality using the leaked secret key.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Spiceworks HDS version 1.3.3 and later by implementing a whitelist of allowed sort parameters and sanitizing input.
- The proof-of-concept exploit (POC) is available at [CVE-2021-43609-POC](https://github.com/d5sec/CVE-2021-43609-POC).
- The exploit is a two-stage process: first, SQLi to read the environment file with the secret key base and second, a Ruby script to perform RCE by crafting a malicious cookie.
- This vulnerability is present in Spiceworks Help Desk Server (HDS), which is an on-premise application and is packaged as an OVA file.
