- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers could potentially gain control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability can lead to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `email` parameter in the `login.php` file.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter via HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `login.php` page.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and HTTP is required.
