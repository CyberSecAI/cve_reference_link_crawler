  "CVE-2022-21304": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to how the MySQL server parses SQL statements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of SQL statements"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or other unspecified impacts.  The vulnerability could cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "MySQL Protocol"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send malicious SQL statements to a vulnerable MySQL server. Access to the affected MySQL service is required, but it does not necessarily require authentication, but an attacker with `CREATE` privileges could potentially exploit the issue.",
      "additional_information": "The provided documents indicate that this vulnerability affects the MySQL Server component and might be exploitable over the network, although access privileges to the database service is required. The vulnerability is related to SQL parsing, so sending crafted SQL statements is the attack vector. This is a vulnerability reported by Jie Liang, Jingzhou Fu, and Yaoguang Chen of WingTecher Lab of Tsinghua University."
