Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29030:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from securitylab.github.com explicitly mentions `GHSL-2023-156 has CVE-2024-29030` and describes an SSRF vulnerability in the `/api/resource` endpoint, which corresponds to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `ExternalLink` parameter in the `/api/resource` endpoint. Specifically, while the code checks for "http" or "https" schemes, it doesn't prevent the use of attacker-controlled URLs pointing to internal resources. It then uses the supplied URL to perform a GET request, without further validation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes a request to a user-supplied URL, allowing an attacker to potentially interact with internal services.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SSRF vulnerability to enumerate and read from the internal network, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   The provided content also mentions that the other SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2024-29029) can lead to XSS and Privilege escalation if chained, but this does not seem to be a direct impact of CVE-2024-29030.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   An authenticated user can create a resource with a malicious `ExternalLink`, causing the server to make a request to an attacker-controlled or internal URL.
* The specific attack vector is through the `/api/resource` endpoint, by sending a POST request with a crafted `ExternalLink` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Memos application to exploit this vulnerability, and have the rights to create new resources.

**Summary of CVE-2024-29030:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation of the `ExternalLink` parameter within the `/api/resource` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerability:** SSRF.
*  **Impact:** Information disclosure through internal network enumeration.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious `ExternalLink` within a resource creation request to the `/api/resource` endpoint.
*   **Attacker Position:** Authenticated user of the application.
