Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security-related changes made in commit `58cb3d987372c91eb605853c35325701733337c2`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit addresses the issue of users being able to change their passwords without verifying their old password. Additionally, some CLI commands related to user management were missing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of old password verification:** Before this commit, users could change their passwords without providing their old password, potentially allowing unauthorized password changes.
*   **Missing CLI commands:** The absence of certain CLI commands hindered the ability to manage user accounts effectively from the command line.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** An attacker could potentially change a user's password without knowing the old one. This could lead to account takeover, data breaches, and unauthorized access to the ZenML system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct manipulation through CLI or API:** An attacker could exploit the lack of old password verification by using the available methods for password change.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the ZenML server:** The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the ZenML server either through the command line or through API access.
*   **User account details**: The attacker would need some type of valid user account within the system to attempt to change the password.

**Summary of Changes:**
The commit introduces the following security fixes:

*   **Old password verification:** The `update_user` function in `src/zenml/client.py` is updated to require the old password to be passed when a user's password is being changed. It now raises a `ValidationError` if `old_password` is not provided when `updated_password` is set.
*   **CLI changes:** The `change-password` CLI command in `src/zenml/cli/user_management.py` now prompts the user for the old password as well as the new password, and verifies the new password entered a second time for confirmation.
*  **Deactivate User CLI Command**: Adds a CLI command to deactivate users, as well as outputting a link to reactivate the user account via the dashboard.
*   **CLI Warnings:** Added warnings in `src/zenml/cli/server.py` and `src/zenml/cli/user_management.py` about supplying passwords via the command line, instead of using the prompt method, for security reasons.
*   **Improved documentation and docstrings:**  Added or improved documentation and docstrings throughout the changed files.
*   **Auto updates**: Added various auto update functions for E2E, LLM Finetuning, and NLP templates.

This commit strengthens the security of the ZenML system by ensuring that users are required to verify their old password when changing it, adds missing user management CLI commands, and encourages secure methods for password handling.

**Note**: This analysis provides more detail than a generic CVE description would.
