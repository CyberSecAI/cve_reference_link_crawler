Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36916:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds shift operation in the `blk-iocost.c` file within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `iocg->delay` value is shifted right by a calculated value that can sometimes be larger than the bit size of the data type, leading to undefined behavior. This happens when `div64_u64(tdelta, USEC_PER_SEC)` results in a value that is greater or equal to `BITS_PER_LONG`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** The core vulnerability is the undefined behavior caused by shifting a 64-bit unsigned long long (`u64`) by a shift amount that is equal to or exceeds 64.
- **Out-of-bounds shift**:  The shift operation `iocg->delay >> div64_u64(tdelta, USEC_PER_SEC)` does not validate `div64_u64(tdelta, USEC_PER_SEC)` is less than the number of bits in `iocg->delay` before shifting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined value:** The immediate impact is an undefined value for `delay`.  The exact consequences of an undefined `delay` are not fully known but may cause issues that are difficult to debug.
- **Potential Denial of Service:** NetApp states that successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, which is a possible impact since this bug is located in the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists in the block layer I/O cost control mechanism, `blk-iocost.c`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `iocg_kick_delay` is called, and the value `tdelta` (difference between current time and `iocg->delay_at`) is sufficiently large, leading to a large shift amount.
- It is triggered by a timer function, potentially making it predictable/reliable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence or trigger I/O operations that involve the `iocost` mechanism.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user, according to the CVSS vector.
-  No user interaction is needed.
- Low privileges are sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the shift amount is within the valid range (`shift < BITS_PER_LONG`). If the shift amount is too large, the delay is set to 0.
- The provided commits all resolve the issue in the same manner.
- NetApp has rated the CVSS score as 5.3 (MEDIUM).
- NetApp reports that some of its products are affected by this vulnerability, mostly in the HCI Baseboard Management Controller.
