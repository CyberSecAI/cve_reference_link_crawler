Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36953:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `vgic_v2_parse_attr` function within the Linux kernel's KVM implementation for ARM64 architecture. This function is responsible for retrieving a virtual CPU (vCPU) based on a user-provided CPUID. The function was not checking if `kvm_get_vcpu_by_id` returns a valid pointer (non-NULL) before using it. If an invalid CPUID was provided, `kvm_get_vcpu_by_id` would return NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the lack of a check for a NULL return value from `kvm_get_vcpu_by_id`, which results in dereferencing a null pointer.
- **Incorrect Input Validation:** The code did not validate the user-provided CPUID which can be out of range.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A null pointer dereference can cause the kernel to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation** While not directly stated, a kernel crash could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation in certain scenarios

**Attack vectors:**
- **ioctl:** The vulnerability is triggered via an ioctl that uses the `vgic_v2_parse_attr` function.
- **User-provided CPUID:**  A malicious user, or a process with the ability to control the CPUID passed to the ioctl, can exploit this by providing an invalid CPUID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the KVM device, which means they would likely need to be a user with the ability to create and manage virtual machines.
- They need to be able to make ioctl calls to the KVM device, specifically targeting the vulnerable function by providing an invalid CPUID.

**Additional notes:**
The provided information includes multiple patch commits addressing the same issue. The fix implemented in these commits is a simple check for a NULL return from `kvm_get_vcpu_by_id` and returning `-EINVAL` if it's null to prevent the crash, making the `ioctl` fail gracefully.
The Debian LTS advisory also lists this CVE as one of several fixed in a security update, confirming its status as a known vulnerability.
