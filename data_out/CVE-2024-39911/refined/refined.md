Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the 1Panel's `openresty` component. Specifically, the user-agent header, which is part of the HTTP request, is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries to log web requests. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `User-Agent` header, before using it in database queries.
*  **Use of SQLite:**  The use of SQLite database, while not directly a vulnerability, facilitates the exploitation by enabling the use of the `ATTACH DATABASE` statement for file writing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can create new databases and tables, then insert data into them. This capability is leveraged to write arbitrary PHP code into a file within the web server's document root, leading to RCE.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to generate a very large amount of random data in the database, causing performance issues and potentially leading to a denial-of-service. By using `RANDOMBLOB()` function with large values, the database file can grow rapidly, causing the logging functionality to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in the `User-Agent` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable 1Panel instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, making it highly accessible.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs some basic knowledge of the file system to write the malicious file to the correct location of the web server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in both the website monitoring and WAF functionalities of 1Panel.
*   The exploit involves injecting SQL code to create a new SQLite database file which is placed in a web accessible folder and used to execute arbitrary php code.
*   The vulnerability was found in versions `v1.10.10-lts` of both the professional and community editions of 1Panel and was fixed in version `v1.10.12-lts`.
*   The vulnerability resides in the `1panel/openresty` docker container, specifically versions `1.21.4.3-3-1-focal` and lower.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable if the WAF functionality is disabled for the "Website Monitoring Functionality" and is exploitable if the WAF functionality is enabled for the "WAF Functionality".
*   The vulnerability was reported by user Junehck (from blog.mo60.cn)
