- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue in the Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE) protocol implementation within the Matter protocol. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of proper handling of replayed CASE Sigma1 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to replay attacks using manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages. This lack of replay protection allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to device unresponsiveness, requiring a power cycle to restore normal operation. This constitutes a denial-of-service attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, specifically exploiting the CASE protocol over the network. An attacker replays manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target device to be able to intercept and replay messages. No specific privileges are required and no user interaction is needed.
