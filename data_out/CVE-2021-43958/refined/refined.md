- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts. Various REST resources in Fisheye and Crucible did not check if users exceeded their maximum failed login attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CAPTCHA requirement for failed login attempts on various REST resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can brute-force user login credentials.
- **Attack vectors:**  Remote attackers can make repeated login attempts to REST resources, without triggering CAPTCHA requirements after exceeding failed login limits.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable REST resources. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
