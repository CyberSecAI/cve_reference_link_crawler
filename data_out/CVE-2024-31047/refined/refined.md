- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow occurs in the `exrmultipart.cpp` file when multiplying two integers, where the result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the `int` type. Specifically, line 303 is mentioned.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). The overflow can lead to undefined behavior and program crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input file (`poc.zip`) to the `exrmultipart` tool with the `-convert` option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker with the ability to run the `exrmultipart` tool with a malicious crafted file can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specific input file that causes an integer overflow.
