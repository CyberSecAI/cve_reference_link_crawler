The provided content is related to CVE-2024-44540.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to interrupt the normal boot process of Ubiquiti Airmax devices via the UART interface and gain access to the U-Boot bootloader. By modifying the `bootargs` variable in U-Boot, the system can be forced to execute `/bin/sh` instead of the regular `/init` process, resulting in a root shell without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Unprotected access to the bootloader via the UART interface.
- Ability to modify boot parameters via the bootloader.
- Insecure boot process that allows for arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Complete bypass of the login mechanism, granting root shell access.
- Ability to read and modify the device's configuration, including the user password hash.
- Ability to perform a factory reset or change the admin password.
- Potential to upload a modified firmware.
- Complete control over the vulnerable device.

**Attack vectors:**

- Physical access to the device to connect to the UART interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Physical access to the Ubiquiti Airmax device.
- Basic knowledge of electronics, serial communication, and U-Boot.
- Ability to identify UART pins (VCC, GND, TX, RX) on the deviceâ€™s PCB.
- Serial to USB adapter and a computer with a serial terminal program.
