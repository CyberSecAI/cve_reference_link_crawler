The vulnerability is the use of implicit PendingIntents with the PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE set that leads to theft and/or (over-)write of arbitrary files with system privilege in the Bluetooth ("com.lge.bluetoothsetting") app. The attacker's app, if it had access to app notifications, could intercept them and redirect them to its activity, before making it grant access permissions to content providers with the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` flag.
