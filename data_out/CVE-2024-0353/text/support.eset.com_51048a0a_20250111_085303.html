# [CA8612] ESET Customer Advisory: Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in ESET products for Windows fixed

ESET Customer Advisory 2024-0003
February 14, 2024
Severity: High
### Summary

A report of a local privilege escalation vulnerability was submitted to ESET by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). The vulnerability potentially allowed an attacker to misuse ESET’s file operations, as performed by the Real-time file system protection, to delete files without having proper permission.

### Details

The vulnerability in file operations handling, performed by the Real-time file system protection feature on the Windows operating system, potentially allowed an attacker with an ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to delete arbitrary files as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, escalating their privileges.

The reserved CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2024-0353. The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8 with the following CVSS vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild.

### Solution

ESET prepared fixed builds of its consumer, business and server security products for the Windows operating system and recommends upgrading to these or scheduling the upgrades in the near future. The fixed builds are available in the [Download section](https://www.eset.com/) or via the ESET Repository.

* ESET NOD32 Antivirus, ESET Internet Security, ESET Smart Security Premium, ESET Security Ultimate 17.0.10.0 and later
* ESET Endpoint Antivirus for Windows and ESET Endpoint Security for Windows 11.0.2032.0, 10.1.2063.0, 10.0.2052.0, 9.1.2071.0, 8.1.2062.0 and later from the respective version family
* ESET Server Security for Windows Server (formerly File Security for Microsoft Windows Server) 10.0.12015.0, 9.0.12019.0, 8.0.12016.0, 7.3.12013.0 and later from the respective version family
* ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server 10.1.10014.0, 10.0.10018.0, 9.0.10012.0, 8.0.10024.0, 7.3.10018.0 and later from the respective version family
* ESET Mail Security for IBM Domino 10.0.14007.0, 9.0.14008.0, 8.0.14014.0, 7.3.14006.0 and later from the respective version family
* ESET Security for Microsoft SharePoint Server 10.0.15005.0, 9.0.15006.0, 8.0.15012.0, 7.3.15006.0 and later from the respective version family
* ESET File Security for Microsoft Azure customers should migrate to the latest version of ESET Server Security for Microsoft Windows Server

Because upgrading to these product versions requires [Azure Code Signing support](https://support-eol.eset.com/en/trending_weol2023_10_2022.html), ESET took an extra step, on top of what is declared by the [End of Life policy](https://support-eol.eset.com/en/policy_business/support_levels.html) and prepared a fix to this vulnerability that is also applicable to users without Azure Code Signing support. Cleaner module version 1248 released the fix as part of the standard module updates. Regularly updated devices should already have this update applied automatically. Please note this is an exceptional case and it is still necessary to have Azure Code Signing support to be able to install new builds of ESET applications that may address other bugs and vulnerabilities in the future.
