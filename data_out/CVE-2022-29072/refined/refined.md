Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of a heap overflow in `7zFM.exe` and a command execution vulnerability in the Windows HTML Help component (`hh.exe`). The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted `.7z` archive file is dragged and dropped onto the 7-Zip help window.
*   The core issue lies in how 7-Zip interacts with the Windows HTML Help API. Instead of creating a child process under `hh.exe`, 7-zip directly calls the HTML Help API from within its own process, `7zFM.exe`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** A heap overflow exists in `7zFM.exe` when processing a malicious `.7z` file.
*   **Command Execution via `hh.exe`:** The Windows HTML Help executable (`hh.exe`) is known to be vulnerable to command execution, often through the use of ActiveXObject and WScript.Shell within HTML help files.
*   **Incorrect API usage by 7-Zip:** 7-Zip incorrectly calls the HTML Help API from within its own process, creating a security vulnerability, instead of creating a child process under `hh.exe`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate privileges from a regular user to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` (system-level) by exploiting the vulnerabilities. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the highest privileges on the system.
*   **Command Execution:** Arbitrary commands can be executed through the help viewer's vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and Drop:** The primary attack vector involves dragging a malicious `.7z` file onto the 7-Zip help window (`Help>Contents`).
*   **Malicious .7z File:** A specially crafted .7z file is required to trigger the heap overflow. This file also contains a payload designed to exploit the `hh.exe` command execution vulnerability.
*   **Windows HTML Help:** The vulnerability leverages the interaction with the Windows HTML Help system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
*   **User privileges:** The attacker does not need administrative privileges to start the attack.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):** Social engineering could be used to trick the user into dragging the malicious `.7z` file onto the help window.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found after discovering the XXE vulnerability on WinRAR and noticing that the HTML Helper file can execute commands via javascript, just like HTA files.
*   The researcher was trying to get reverse shell access from different compression formats, and he was thinking about the possibility to use the HTML Helper file for that.
*   The researcher discovered a heap overflow in `FzGM.exe` after fuzzing, but it was not useful by itself since the exploit would run with the same user's privileges.
*   The researcher states that the vulnerability is related to how 7-Zip calls the Windows API and that the program is vulnerable in two locations, causing an authorization problem.
*   The researcher notes that after the heap overflow, the called API has an authorization issue, and that the vulnerability lies in an incorrect configuration within the `7z.dll` file.
*   The researcher indicates that the payload does not directly call the HTML Helper API but rather hooks into it and leverages an authorization problem with the base pointer.
*   The researcher used `psexec` within the payload to elevate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`.
*   A registry key bypass was implemented to disable ActiveX warnings before executing the payload `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\0' -Name '1201' -Value '0'`.
*   The researcher states that he informed the developers and CVE authority. He also mentions that he may not publish the privilege escalation exploit code.
*   The researcher recommends deleting the `7-zip.chm` file or ensuring all users have read and execute permissions on the program to prevent exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects Windows versions of 7-zip.
