He sent me a file he said proved his claims, but it was just some naïve attempt at directory traversal that couldn't possibly work. When I told him that, he said "that file doesn't belong to me anyway" - then explained he was planning his wedding and was too busy to answer more questions. Logically, if there was a way to escalate privileges via 7-zip, then it could also be exploited with CreateRemoteThread() - why would a heap overflow be necessary? What change to 7-zip has he requested that would prevent that? Why the bizarre drag-and-dropping operation, why not just double click a HTA file? I suspect there is no heap overflow and no privilege escalation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [octagons](user?id=octagons) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071897)   | [prev](#31074460) | [next](#31070420) [–]  The vulnerability in hh.exe is already well known and documented by the LOLBAS project [0]. My team and I (Adversary Simulation at IBM X-Force Red) conduct stealth-oriented red team security assessments and we use vulnerabilities like this to do our jobs every day - just as any red team worth its salt would. Capabilities like this are built into all kinds of tools that are installed by default on Windows. They are often essential to obtaining code or command execution on hosts through social engineering or post-exploitation when moving laterally between hosts. This is just speculation, but the privesc vulnerability might be related to memory allocation in the DLL used to integrate with the system shell context menu - i.e. right clicking on a file. Just a guess based on the mention of a heap overflow.

At least it was common in places I've worked where your local PC was so locked down that you couldn't do your job, and the official process to work around that wasn't reasonable.

Not really. They seem to be implying they got to running a command as SYSTEM from 7-zip, but, like, don't specify things like what security context 7-zip started as, or how a program running as non-admin got to a system security context, or like, how that's 7zip's fault and not the fault of the OS. This is all very confusing. Even if all they did was took that screen shot from process explorer and expanded it to include the user column, it would be like 99% more clear what the fuck is going on. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bramblerose](user?id=bramblerose) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31070785)   | [prev](#31070420) | [next](#31070765) [–]  Very confusingly written document, but from what I gather there are *two* vulnerabilities that are problematic for different reasons. 1) a command execution vulnerability in 7z. This is problematic because a downloaded 7z file could compromise your machine; 2) a privilege escalation vulnerability in the MS help viewer. This is problematic because it could allow an unprivileged user to gain admin rights. Why the help viewer does anything as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is beyond me. However the post presents them as one single vulnerability? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [smileybarry](user?id=smileybarry) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31070949)   | [parent](#31070785) | [next](#31071062) [–]  > Why the help viewer does anything as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is beyond me. I don't get it either. From poking around in Process Explorer the help viewer window isn't its own process, it's still part of "7zFM.exe" which is running at medium integrity (not admin). Don't know where the high integrity context is coming from. I wonder if it's silent elevation, in which case just putting UAC on "always ask" is good enough (and what I do anyway). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [divingdragon](user?id=divingdragon) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071186)   | [root](#31070785) | [parent](#31070949) | [next](#31071324) [–]  The PoC video showed that the current user isn't in the "Administrator" group (though there is another user "zeroday" in there), which makes it look like not a simple UAC bypass.

I don't think it *does*. The report states that they achieved execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM using psexec from "SysInternals"; arguably, running something as SYSTEM is psexec's entire purpose, but it does require the installation of a service that runs as SYSTEM and brokers execution. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [divingdragon](user?id=divingdragon) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071378)   | [parent](#31070785) | [prev](#31071500) | [next](#31070765) [–]  I am failing to see (1). It seems when you drop a file into the help viewer window, it is handled by the help viewer itself. You can try it with a random file.

This API call does not even seem to run `hh.exe`. How does this privilege escalation actually work?

If there is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Help Viever then nobody can stop anyone from writing a payload that mimicks the heap overflowing code in 7zip. But of course that doesn't get you clicks so why not bait everyone by attaching name of a popular open source software to it.

Why does 7zip even have admin privileges to give away, in the first place? It seems to be based on some odd interaction with the help system but I can't really parse the description. The description of the bug seems a bit weird > At this stage, 7-zip stated that the vulnerability was caused by hh.exe, but they were told that if there was a command injection from hh.exe, a child process should be created under hh.exe, so especially the heap-overflow side of this vulnerability will not be shared with the community. I think this is a reference to a conversation with the people behind 7-zip (?). It seems like a weird mix of technical details and finger-pointing. > As it is known, Microsoft HELPER ie hh.exe file "html help. full name microsoft html help executable. Program that opens help files with the chm extension." has been defined as. Many operations such as XXE, Command Execution are performed through the hh.exe file. It is possible to see vulnerabilities such as XXE or command execution in every program that uses the hh.exe interface. This issue came to my mind after the discovery of the XXE vulnerability detected by WinRAR. (<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47526>) Although the developers of 7-zip say that Microsoft should fix the command execution authority obtained from hh.exe at this point, it has been observed that at the end of the day, thanks to the heap overflow in 7zFM.exe and the command execution feature in hh.exe, privilege elevation is provided in the administrator mode. Seems like a pretty solid argument from the 7zip folks, right? They can't really be blamed if the Windows help system has decided to give them root for some reason. And since 7zip is partially open source, any would-be hacker could just grab an old version of the code if they wanted to weaponize this, right? But maybe there's something I'm missing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [api](user?id=api) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071232)   | [prev](#31071007) | [next](#31071443) [–]  Windows privilege escalation bugs are so unbelievably common. We just fixed one in our MSI installer, and when I went to search for the CVE there were like 10 recent ones from different things including various VPN clients and shell extension apps. The culprit is usually the insane Windows ACL permission system. Unix permissions look like "rwxr-xr-x" while a very simple example of a Windows permission is: D:(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;WD) Windows is a single user OS. If you are depending on its local user permission access control to be anything more than advisory you are going to have a bad time. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GordonS](user?id=GordonS) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071793)   | [parent](#31071232) | [next](#31071644) [–]  The string-based representation of Windows ACLs is more complex than Linux ACLs - because it's a more complex and powerful system. While your last paragraph is technically true, ACLs can also be applied on files from network shares.

If we're talking about desktops systems, privesc is trivial in either OS. In Linux you can do a million things to privesc, such as snooping passwords via X11, modifying the various user files like ~/.bashrc with aliases, etc. On Windows UAC isn't even intended to be a barrier. 2. If we're talking about servers, I'm not sure that Windows is 10:1 worse on privescs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zaarn](user?id=zaarn) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31074507)   | [root](#31071232) | [parent](#31071865) | [next](#31073029) [–]  I'd say the main intention of UAC is to make sudo but without obvious vulnerabilities. The UAC dialog is wired deep into the system and you can't fake it. It takes priority over any UI stuff and won't accept input from a program you didn't specifically authorize (which requires accepting a UAC prompt). On the flipside, all it takes to manipulate sudo on Unix systems is to write a TTY emulator that just middlewares between the user and sudo. Then just alias via bashrc or any number of other places that can prompt for a user password. There is not protection sudo can deploy against that. Polkit helps a bit but X11 isn't great at helping there either since other programs can just send keystrokes. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [staticassertion](user?id=staticassertion) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31076833)   | [root](#31071232) | [parent](#31074507) | [next](#31073029) [–]  I'm just saying that Microsoft has stated that UAC is not intended to be a privilege boundary. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zaarn](user?id=zaarn) [on April 19, 2022](item?id=31081181)   | [root](#31071232) | [parent](#31076833) | [next](#31073029) [–]  It is a clear privilege boundary, just not a barrier. Beyond UAC is Admin, before UAC is non-Admin. Crossing that divide requires a user interaction. UAC can be a barrier if it would display more about the programs intention.

The discretionary access control system in Windows can easily be subverted by a poorly configured dynamic access control policy. Windows is not a single-user OS.

Öncelikle, edindiğiniz incelemelerden bazılarını açıklamaya çalışmak istiyorum: Anladığım kadarıyla, kötü aktörler, sosyal deneyler veya tam şarlatanlar bir kereden fazla kendilerini twitter gibi yerlerde yasal güvenlik araştırmacıları olarak kurmayı başardılar. daha sonra teknik olmayan kişiler veya bir şeyleri iki kez kontrol etmeyen kişiler tarafından büyütülen yalanlar. Bu nedenle, bazı yüksek profilli güvenlik araştırmacıları, asılsız iddialarda bulunan ve onlara karşı uyarıda bulunan kişilere karşı temkinlidir. Bunu yayınlamanın/paylaşmanın ne anlamı var diye sormak istiyorum, bilinen bir yama yoksa bakımcılar bunun gerçek bir sorun olduğunu düşünmüyorlar ve aslında hiçbir detay paylaşmayacaksınız. İkinci soru, eğer yama yapılırsa/ne zaman olursa veya bakımcılar yama yapmayı reddederse daha ayrıntılı bir açıklama veya bir PoC yayınlamayı planlıyor musunuz? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [logical\_person](user?id=logical_person) [on April 19, 2022](item?id=31086481)   | [root](#31077473) | [parent](#31078618) | [next](#31076769) [–]  Super problematic that the HN mod team removed these posts by the author.

This has a CVE number allocated (CVE-2022-29072) and the README mentions 7-zip disputing that this is their problem (rather, some underlying Windows component). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [DaiPlusPlus](user?id=DaiPlusPlus) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31070709)   | [parent](#31070659) | [prev](#31070763) | [next](#31071322) [–]  The repo doesn't contain any exploit code nor further technical details of the vuln, so I guess this is only semi-irresponsible-disclosure? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [encryptluks2](user?id=encryptluks2) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071322)   | [parent](#31070659) | [prev](#31070709) | [next](#31072037) [–]  Imagine someone you think is homeless comes up to you and says, hey you left your child on top of your car. You say, thanks but did you fill out form K7804 to inform me responsibly about the issue. They say, form K7804? But your child, and that sounds like a lot of work to help you.. will you pay me to waste my time to help you? You say, no guarantees that I'll pay you but if you don't inform me responsibly, I'll tell everyone you are the bad person here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [willis936](user?id=willis936) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31071424)   | [root](#31070659) | [parent](#31071322) | [next](#31072586) [–]  What are you talking about? Analogies are weak point makers even when they're accurate, but what you're describing as entirely unrelated to what happened. This is Microsoft's bug that affects many programs. Was Microsoft informed before this exploit was made public? What does it buy anyone to throw this out in the public first? There is no indication that the exploit finder was hunting a bounty or denied a bounty. Afaict you fabricated a controversial story in your head then tried to explain it to everyone else. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jccalhoun](user?id=jccalhoun) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31072586)   | [root](#31070659) | [parent](#31071322) | [prev](#31071424) | [next](#31077564) [–]  I think a better comparison would be: Someone has left a child on a car roof. Someone else sees it and instead of telling the person, posts about it online. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bee\_rider](user?id=bee_rider) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31077564)   | [root](#31070659) | [parent](#31071322) | [prev](#31072586) | [next](#31072037) [–]  This analogy would almost work, but the program actually makes others' computers vulnerable. So, it is more like deciding not to fill out form K7804 if a bunch of people's kids were on top of a schoolbus. And also, disclosure actually makes attackers aware of the vulnerability. So, it is like informing a radio station which will broadcast out the message. And while many bus drivers listen to this ratio station, it is actually really popular among a set of people who enjoy crashing into misconfigured buses like this to cause mayhem. I'm not sure how to fit the state sponsored bus crashers into the analogy. Actually I'm beginning to think it isn't a very useful analogy at all. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akerl\_](user?id=akerl_) [on April 18, 2022](item?id=31072037)   | [parent](#31070659) | [prev](#31071322) [–]  The term you’re looking for is “coordinated disclosure”, and the alternative used here is “full disclosure”. | | --- | --- | --- | | |
