The provided content details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in idccms V1.35.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Absence of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF measures.
- The application trusts requests originating from the user's browser session without verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can induce a logged-in user's browser to submit unintended requests to the idccms application.
- In this case, the provided PoC demonstrates an attacker's ability to potentially add a new "vpsCompany", by sending a crafted request to `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/vpsCompany_deal.php?mudi=add&nohrefStr=close`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out by enticing a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link.
- The malicious page will then submit a crafted form to the vulnerable endpoint in the background (without the user's knowledge), utilizing the victim's active session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker also needs a user to have an active session on the vulnerable idccms application.
