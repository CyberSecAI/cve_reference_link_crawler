### CVE-2024-1377

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Happy Addons for Elementor plugin does not sufficiently sanitize user input and escape output in the 'author\_meta\_tag' attribute of the Author Meta widget.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script executes within their browser session. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious sites
    - Deface the website
    - Perform other malicious activities in the context of the victim's session

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious script via the 'author\_meta\_tag' attribute of the Author Meta widget within the WordPress editor.
- The injected script is stored in the database and will be executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher in WordPress.
- Ability to use the Elementor page builder to add and modify the Author Meta widget.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.10.3.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.10.4.
