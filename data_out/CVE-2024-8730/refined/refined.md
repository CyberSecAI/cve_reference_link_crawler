Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8730:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2024-8730**, as indicated in the Wordfence article title "Exit Notifier <= 1.10.4 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting" and its CVE identifier.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function within the Exit Notifier WordPress plugin. Specifically, it's the use of this function without proper escaping of the URL.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin's failure to sanitize the URL used in `add_query_arg` creates an opportunity for attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in a user's browser.
   - **Potential for Data Theft or Unauthorized Actions:** Successful exploitation could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Maliciously Crafted Links:** An attacker can create a specially crafted link containing the malicious script.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker then needs to trick a user into clicking on this malicious link to trigger the XSS.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions of the Exit Notifier plugin up to and including version 1.10.4.
*   **Patch Information**: The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.6 of the plugin.
* The vulnerable code location is in `plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/exit-notifier/trunk/includes/class-exit-notifier-settings.php#L707` which corresponds to the `add_query_arg` function call in the settings page creation.
* The vulnerability is related to how the plugin creates links for tab navigation within the plugin's settings page. It uses `add_query_arg` to add the `tab` parameter to the URL, but the value of this parameter is not sanitized. This makes it possible to inject a malicious script as the value of the tab parameter
