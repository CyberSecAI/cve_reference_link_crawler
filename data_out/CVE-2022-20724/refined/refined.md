  "CVE-2022-20724": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the allocation of tokens within the Cisco IOx application hosting environment.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition leading to token reuse or unauthorized access.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication and impersonate another authenticated user session. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources and functionalities intended for legitimate users.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through calls to the upload API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send constant requests to the upload API while a legitimate administrator is deploying an application.  The attacker does not need prior authentication, but needs to time the exploitation correctly."
