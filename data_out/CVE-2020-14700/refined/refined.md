  "CVE-2020-14700": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the implementation of the e1000 virtual network adapter, which leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading past the end of an allocated buffer. When combined with other vulnerabilities, this can lead to privilege escalation and code execution in the context of the hypervisor.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system."
  }
