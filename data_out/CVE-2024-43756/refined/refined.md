- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) vulnerability is present.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L) and no privileges required (PR:N). The user interaction is required (UI:R)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need local access to the system and the user would need to interact (e.g. open a malicious file).
