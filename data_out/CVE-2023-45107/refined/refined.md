- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress GoodBarber plugin <= 1.0.23 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could result in unauthorized changes or actions performed on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin. They would then need to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into executing this request, often by embedding it within a malicious link or website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They must be able to entice a logged-in, privileged user to trigger the crafted request.
