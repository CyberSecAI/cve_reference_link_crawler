Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The front-end step editor in the MeterSphere system stores data without proper sanitization, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability exists in the step editor of the system's front-end.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the step editor. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or stealing sensitive data from other users when they view the compromised content.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious script into the step editor. The attack vector is considered local.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify data within the step editor. No privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

The provided content also includes CVSS v3 base metrics:
*   Attack Vector (AV): Local
*   Attack Complexity (AC): Low
*   Privileges Required (PR): None
*   User Interaction (UI): None
*   Scope (S): Unchanged
*   Confidentiality (C): None
*   Integrity (I): Low
*   Availability (A): None

This translates to a CVSS score of 4.0
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

The content also includes a recommendation to "Limit and validate the XSS options."
