The content is related to CVE-2024-37726.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the MSI Center application running with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and writing a file to a low-privilege user-controlled directory. This allows a low-privileged user to manipulate the file system with symlinks and trick the application into writing to or overwriting arbitrary files in the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled file write location by a SYSTEM privileged process.
- The application is susceptible to symlink attacks due to insufficient checks on the target location of file write operations.
- Use of Oplocks can be manipulated by low privileged users to gain write access to arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite or deletion of critical system files by low-privileged users.
- Potential privilege escalation by overwriting critical system files or startup scripts.
- Complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Utilizing the "Export System Info" function in MSI Center which causes file operations.
- Exploiting file system manipulation techniques such as symlinks and junctions in conjunction with Oplocks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged user access on the system.
- Ability to create directories, files, junctions, and symbolic links.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable application's behavior and the necessary steps for the exploit.
