```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `log` function, which is a wrapper to `vsnprintf` and `puts`, is misused in the `/action/wirelessConnect` HTTP handler. Specifically, the `format` parameter of `vsnprintf` within the `log` function is populated with attacker-controlled data from HTTP parameters, leading to a format string vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Format string injection vulnerability in the `log` function.",
     "Lack of proper sanitization of HTTP parameters `default_key_id` and `key` before being used in a format string within the `log` function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service by sending a specially-crafted HTTP request that exploits format string vulnerabilities. The attacker can potentially leak stack memory and write arbitrary memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending an authenticated HTTP request to the `/action/wirelessConnect` endpoint with crafted `default_key_id` and `key` HTTP parameters when the `auth_mode` parameter is either `WEP` or `SHARED`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface. The web interface is disabled by default, but can be re-enabled using previously discovered vulnerabilities. Additionally, a physically present attacker with UART access can observe the output of the format string vulnerabilities."
