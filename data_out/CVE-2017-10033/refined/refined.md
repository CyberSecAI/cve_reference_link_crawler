Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-10033:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from Exploit-DB directly references **CVE-2017-10033** and indicates an improper access control vulnerability within Oracle WebCenter FatWire Content Server.
*   The Oracle advisory lists CVE-2017-10033 as affecting Oracle WebCenter Sites.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **incorrect access control** over several resources within Oracle WebCenter FatWire Content Server. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication checks before allowing access to sensitive resources.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce proper access control mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to functionalities and data.
*   **SQL Injection (Indirect):** The lack of authentication allows attackers to potentially send arbitrary SQL queries to the database by manipulating the application's parameters, allowing for unauthorized data retrieval.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to query the database and retrieve the database schema through the `/cs/Satellite` endpoint without authentication.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The system fails to properly authenticate users before processing requests to specific resources, like `Support/Verify/export`, `Support/Verify/tablelistHTML` and `Support/CacheManager/FlushTables`.
*   **Unprotected Resources:** The `/cs/Satellite` endpoint does not require authentication for accessing administrative and sensitive functionalities.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other confidential data.
*   **Database Schema Exposure:** The ability to query the database schema reveals potentially sensitive details about the database's structure.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposure of database credentials or schema can be used as a basis for more advanced attacks or data manipulation.
*   **Denial of Service:** The provided proof of concepts allow for querying, which can affect availability of the service if too many requests are sent.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the database credentials are compromised, a complete system compromise is possible.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector primarily involves sending malicious HTTP POST and GET requests to the `/cs/Satellite` endpoint.
*   **Manipulation of URL Parameters:** Attackers can manipulate parameters like `pagename`, `query`, and `tbl` in HTTP requests to execute SQL queries or access unauthorized resources.
*   **Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system running Oracle WebCenter FatWire Content Server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the `/cs/Satellite` endpoint.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to construct HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit targets versions of Fatwire prior to version 7.
*   The Exploit-DB entry lists Oracle WebCenter FatWire Content Server as the affected product, while the Oracle advisory lists Oracle WebCenter Sites. They both appear to be the same product as described.

In summary, CVE-2017-10033 represents a serious vulnerability in Oracle WebCenter Sites due to improper access control, allowing for unauthorized database access, information disclosure, and potential system compromise. An attacker with basic network access and an understanding of HTTP requests can exploit the flaw.
