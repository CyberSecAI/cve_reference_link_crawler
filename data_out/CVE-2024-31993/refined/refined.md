{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses user-provided URLs to make HTTP requests without proper validation or rate limiting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
	  "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can map internal network resources, retrieve content from internal web servers, or cause a denial of service by exhausting the server's resources or an external target's resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "POST requests to the `/api/recipes/create-url` endpoint with a malicious URL.",
      "POST requests to the `/api/recipes/{id}/image` endpoint with a malicious URL."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user is required to exploit this vulnerability. Default credentials (`changeme@example.com`) or open signups allow access.",
    "additional_details": [
	  "The `safe_scrape_html` function in `mealie/services/scraper/scraper_strategies.py` is vulnerable to SSRF as it does not validate URLs or restrict them to FQDNs, allowing access to internal IPs.",
      "The `safe_scrape_html` function is also vulnerable to DoS because it is not rate-limited. An attacker can make multiple requests to external targets, saturating the serverâ€™s CPU or network.",
	  "The `scrape_image` function in `mealie/services/recipe/recipe_data_service.py` is vulnerable to SSRF. It doesn't validate URLs, allowing arbitrary GET requests to private networks.",
	  "The `scrape_image` function is also vulnerable to DoS since it does not have rate limiting and does not chunk the requested content, potentially causing memory exhaustion or crashes. Additionally, retrieved files can be stored on the server and downloaded via a backup if the attacker gains admin access.",
       "The application uses a custom transport class that applies a timeout and blocks known internal address spaces but it is not 100% effective."
