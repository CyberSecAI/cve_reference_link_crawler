Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in the PDF report generation feature of FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager. The application uses the `wkhtmltopdf` tool to generate PDFs from user-supplied HTML, and the tool was an outdated version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows a user to inject HTML code which the server-side PDF generator then interprets and uses to make requests to internal network resources.
*   **Outdated wkhtmltopdf:** The application utilizes an old version of `wkhtmltopdf` (version 0.12.6-dev), which is known to have vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information by making requests to internal web services and displaying the responses in the generated PDF report. This allows attackers to bypass network access controls.
*   **Local Port Scanning:** Attackers can use the SSRF vulnerability to perform port scans on the internal network reachable by the FortiAnalyzer.
*   **Anonymization:** An attacker can anonymize their malicious actions by having the FortiAnalyzer perform the requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted HTTP request to the `/p/fortiview/download/pdf/` endpoint with malicious HTML injected in POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with low privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the FortiAnalyzer server.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** While not strictly required, having knowledge of internal network IP ranges and potential services can increase the impact of the attack.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in FortiAnalyzer versions 7.4.0, 7.2.0 through 7.2.3, 7.0.2 through 7.0.8, and 6.4.8 through 6.4.15.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researchers at Orange Cyberd√©fense and Orange group.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS v3 score of 7.7.
*   The suggested remediation is to upgrade to the fixed versions:
    *   FortiAnalyzer 7.4: Upgrade to 7.4.1 or above
    *   FortiAnalyzer 7.2: Upgrade to 7.2.4 or above
    *   FortiAnalyzer 7.0: Upgrade to 7.0.9 or above
    *   FortiAnalyzer 6.4: Migrate to a fixed release
