An integer overflow exists in the "HyperLinkFrame" stream parser of Ichitaro 2023 1.0.1.59372. A specially crafted document can cause the parser to make an under-sized allocation, which can later allow for memory corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
