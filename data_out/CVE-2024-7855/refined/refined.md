### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the WP Hotel Booking WordPress plugin, specifically an arbitrary file upload vulnerability present in versions up to and including 2.1.2. This vulnerability is due to missing file type validation within the `update_review()` function, allowing authenticated users with subscriber-level access or higher to upload arbitrary files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of file type validation within the `update_review()` function in the `class-wphb-comments.php` file. This function is responsible for handling review submissions, including the upload of images via base64 encoded data. The code fails to check the type or extension of the uploaded files, making it possible to upload files with dangerous extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of file type validation when processing uploaded images, allowing for the upload of any file type, including executable files.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** While some sanitization is present, it doesn't prevent the upload of malicious file types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious PHP files, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the WordPress website.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can upload files that can deface the website.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could use code execution to gain access to the database and steal sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a POST request to the `/wp-json/hb-room/v1/update-review` REST endpoint.
- **File Upload:** The attack involves uploading files using base64 encoding as part of the review submission data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least subscriber-level access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress website.
- **REST API Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the REST API endpoint.

The vulnerability was patched in version 2.1.3 of the plugin. The provided changeset shows the changes made in version 2.1.3, including the addition of the `assets/dist/js/admin/room-review.js` and `assets/dist/js/admin/room-review.min.js` files. While the changeset doesn't show the specific fix, it indicates that the vulnerability was addressed in this version.
