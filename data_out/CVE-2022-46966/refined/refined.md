        "Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
      ],
      "impact": "Allows remote attackers to write a malicious PHP file to disk, which can then be accessed to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php?page=step1` with a malicious `proId` parameter, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. After the malicious PHP file is created in the `/rates/admin/DBbackup` directory, another HTTP GET request with a `cmd` parameter is sent to execute the desired command.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No authentication is required for the SQL injection vulnerability or to access the uploaded file."
