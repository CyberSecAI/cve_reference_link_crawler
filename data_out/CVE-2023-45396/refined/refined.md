The provided content describes a vulnerability found in the Elenos ETG150 FM transmitter, version 3.12. This vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses user-supplied input (specifically, a profile ID) to directly access objects (event profiles) without performing sufficient authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the profile ID provided in the REST URL to retrieve profile data. It does not verify if the user is authorized to access the specific profile.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A low-privilege user can access event profiles of other users by manipulating the profile ID in the REST URL. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information or unauthorized modifications.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Direct manipulation of URL:**  An attacker can intercept and modify the profile ID parameter in a REST URL request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a low-privilege user account.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate parameters.
