The provided content is related to a fix for a kernel panic issue in the Device Mapper (DM) module of the Linux kernel. This issue is caused by a race condition during suspend and resume operations when the blk-mq's unquiesce operation occurs due to external events such as elevator switch or updating nr_requests, while the device mapper is in suspend state.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a race condition between the device mapper's suspend/resume process and blk-mq's unquiesce operation. Specifically, requests could be queued to blk-mq during a device mapper suspend, leading to a kernel panic.

**Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the fact that the DM module doesn't properly handle requests coming in during suspend phase.
*   The issue arises because blk-mq's unquiesce can occur due to various external events (elevator switch, nr_requests updates) which are not synchronized with device mapper's suspend process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic. The system becomes unresponsive and needs to be restarted, leading to potential data loss and downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by external events, such as updating nr_requests or during a DM suspend/resume stress test
*   The attacker would need to cause events that lead to blk-mq's unquiesce and the device mapper to be in a suspended state.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would likely need some control over the system to be able to trigger the conditions that lead to the race condition. This might involve initiating a device mapper suspend operation and triggering the unquiesce.
*  It seems like the attacker needs the ability to update nr_requests or cause elevator switch changes, which are operations typically performed by privileged users or system processes.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves adding a check in `dm_mq_queue_rq` to see if the device mapper is in suspend mode using `test_bit(DMF_BLOCK_IO_FOR_SUSPEND, &md->flags)`.
*   If the flag is set (indicating suspend), the function returns `BLK_STS_RESOURCE`, which signals blk-mq to requeue the request, avoiding the kernel panic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes two commits with the same fix, one from Mike Snitzer and the other from Greg Kroah-Hartman, this suggests that the fix was backported to different branches of the Linux kernel.
*   The commit messages specifically mention a stress test involving `updating nr_requests` and `dm-mpath suspend/resume` that trigger the panic, providing useful information for reproducing the issue.
