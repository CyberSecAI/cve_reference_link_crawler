Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14556 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how OpenJDK handles access control contexts. This suggests a flaw in how permissions or security checks are enforced within the Java runtime environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the Java runtime is not correctly managing access control contexts. This may involve incorrect permission checks or misconfiguration of access control lists (ACLs) within the Java environment.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the improper handling of access control, an attacker may be able to execute code with elevated privileges or outside of intended security boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for an attacker to execute code of their choosing on the targeted system. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Sandbox Bypass:** An attacker may be able to break out of the intended Java sandbox environment, potentially accessing sensitive system resources or data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, related vulnerabilities could allow attackers to read information that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable which suggests that an attacker does not need to have local access to the machine to execute an attack.
*   **Specific Conditions:** The Oracle advisory notes that "This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code." Thus exploitation might involve targeting deployments with untrusted code, applets, or web start applications.
*   **Data Supplied to APIs**:  The advisory also notes exploitation "can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Java process, often through the network.
*   **Ability to Provide Crafted Input:** In order to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would likely need to provide a crafted data stream that causes the improper handling of access control by Java.
*   **Specific Deployment Configuration**: Some content specifies that the vulnerability is more likely to impact client deployments that load untrusted code, or situations where specific APIs are improperly used.

**Additional Notes:**
*   **Multiple Affected Products:** This vulnerability affects a wide range of Oracle products that utilize the vulnerable versions of Java SE.
*   **Patching is critical**: As noted in the Oracle advisory, it is strongly recommended to patch systems against this and other vulnerabilities to prevent malicious actors from taking advantage of the flaws.
*   **Cumulative Patches**:  Oracle patches are often cumulative, meaning they contain fixes for previous vulnerabilities as well. This makes timely patching crucial.
*   **Java versions**: This CVE primarily affects Java SE versions 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7, and 14.0.1, and Java SE Embedded version 8u251
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** The CVSS score indicates that the attack complexity is rated as "High," meaning exploitation is not trivial.
*   **Vendor Specific Patches**: Patches are provided by various vendors like Oracle, RedHat, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE. Patches may include additional fixes and adjustments specific to their distributions.
*  **Openj9/Shenandoah**: Some vendors such as Fedora and OpenSUSE note specific use of "shenandoah-jdk" and "OpenJ9" virtual machines when describing the patch content, and may also include additional patches.
