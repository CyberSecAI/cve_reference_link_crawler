- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Access control for plugin data sources, protected by the `ReqActions` JSON field in `plugin.json`, is bypassed because the check wasn't scoped to each specific data source.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control implementation for plugin data sources. Specifically, the `ReqActions` check was not properly scoped to individual data sources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has query access to one data source can bypass access control restrictions to access any other plugin data source, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have prior query access to at least one data source. With this access, they can bypass restrictions on other data sources using the flaw in the `ReqActions` check.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user or service account with prior query access to at least one data source within Grafana.
