- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` application incorrectly assumes that the `param` field in the JSON request body is always a JSON object. When it receives a non-object value (like an empty string), it attempts to access it as an object using the subscription operator, causing an assertion failure. This leads to the process being killed and the device rebooting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The application fails to validate the type of the `param` field in the JSON request body, leading to an unexpected program state.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a non-object `param` value, an attacker can force the device to reboot, causing service disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body where the `param` field is not a JSON object, but rather a string, such as `""`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While most of these require a logged-in user, it's possible to exploit this vulnerability without authentication using TALOS-2021-1420.
