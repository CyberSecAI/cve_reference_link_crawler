Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-42279.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the RX FIFO is not emptied in the interrupt handler when transmitting with `rx_len == 0`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The RX FIFO is not cleared when a transfer has a receive length of zero (`rx_len == 0`).
- This could lead to a situation where subsequent transfers might read stale data from the previous transfer's RX FIFO into the current transfer's RX buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Reading incorrect or stale data from the RX FIFO into the start RX buffer during subsequent SPI transfers.
- This could lead to data corruption, incorrect device operation, or other unpredictable system behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by performing SPI transfers with a receive length of zero.
- The attacker must have the ability to initiate SPI transfers to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to communicate with the affected SPI device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves clearing both the TX and RX FIFOs before each transfer using the `COMMAND_RXFIFORST` and `COMMAND_TXFIFORST` bits in the `REG_COMMAND` register.
- The fix was introduced to address a bug in the microchip-core SPI driver.
- The `Fixes: 9ac8d17694b6` tag indicates the commit that introduced the bug.
