| 2023-01-31 | MITRE assigns CVE ID. |
| 2023-03-03 | WithSecure publishes this advisory. |

## Description

An authorization issue was discovered in the HTTP API used by the DBD+ mobile companion application, which is used to manage Megafeis branded smart locks. An authenticated user that is able to forge request signing keys can utilize this vulnerability to perform arbitrary API requests. This would grant them the ability to enumerate, transfer ownership of, and unlock any Megafeis smart lock within physical proximity using only the lock's MAC address, which it broadcasts over Bluetooth.

As of this advisory's publishing date, there has been no response from the manufacturer, nor is WithSecure aware of any remedial action taken.

Additional information on this issue, along with related issues discovered by the researcher, can be found in the following locations:

* The [Megafeis-palm: Exploiting Vulnerabilities to Open Bluetooth SmartLocks](/publications/megafeis-palm--exploiting-vulnerabilities-to-open-bluetooth-smar) publication
* The associated GitHub repository:  <https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm>

## Technical Details

Detailed information on this issue's exploitation and discovery can be found at the associated publication, [Megafeis-palm: Exploiting Vulnerabilities to Open Bluetooth SmartLocks](/publications/megafeis-palm--exploiting-vulnerabilities-to-open-bluetooth-smar).

The authorization scheme's weakness can be attributed to two main factors. The first factor is Megafeis' solitary use of a signing key to validate requests sent from the DBD+ application to the backend API server. The second factor is that although session tokens are being sent with each web request to the API, the session tokens do not appear to be used for checking if a user is authorized to make that request.

The signing key was included in a custom HTTP header called "SecSignDest". Version 1.4.2 of the DBD+ application exposed its generation process as being a concatenation of various fixed and dynamic values. They are listed in order below:

* The string "OKLOK"
* The request's timestamp
* Truncated data from the request's body
* The API endpoint to which the request is being sent

After the above information is combined into a single string, a MD5 hash value is generated of that string. The resulting hash value is then used as the "SecSignDest" HTTP header value.

Recreating this formula to forge request signing keys allowed users to send arbitrary authorized requests to the API. Since the server did not perform proper authorization checks, this allowed arbitrary actions to be performed on other users' accounts (i.e. lock ownership reassignment).

To better demonstrate the above, WithSecure modified the source code of the DBD+ application to also add two additional HTTP headers with each web request.

* The first header, "AbdullahMKey" is the previously mentioned concated string
* The second header, "FinalDigest", is a MD5 hash of the "AbdullahMKey" header value

Below is a sample API request sent from the modified application, showing the additional headers mentioned. Note that the "FinalDigest" and "SecSignDest" header values are the same:

WithSecure also put the "AbdullahMKey" header value through a MD5 hash tool, which outputed the same hash value as "FinalDigest" and "AbdullahMKey", as shown in the image below. This demonstrates that the application generated the "SecSignDest" value using the method discovered by the researcher.

## Proof of Concept

WithSecure created a proof of concept script that can be used to fully exploit this issue and take over any Megafeis-branded smart lock. The script requires the MAC address of the target smart lock as well as the attacker's DBD+ account username and password. The script was successfully tested on Megafeis smart lock models FB50S, GS60FB, GS40S, and GQ10FB

The script is available here: <https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/CVE-2022-45636/CVE-2022-45636_PoC.py>

# CVE-2022-45636: Insecure Authorization Scheme for API Requests in DBD+ Mobile Companion Application for Megafeis Smart Locks

## The Issue

While analyzing the back-end HTTP requests made by the mobile app to the central lock-management API, I noticed that the server was validating requests solely with the value of a custom HTTP header called `SecSignDest`. The included `connect.sid` cookie and the `token` header, although being verified for authentication, were not being checked to confirm that the user the token or cookie belonged to, was actually authorized to perform the action being requested.

Furthermore, decompiling the android application and reverse engineering the generation of the `SecSignDest` HTTP header led to the discovery that its value was simply an MD5 hash derived from a fingerprint string, a custom date string, a portion of the HTTP request data, and the API endpoint to which the data was being sent. This meant that anyone who could create these signing keys, could forge requests to the API, and since there were no authorization checks in place, perform arbitrary actions on other users' accounts.

Additionally, all the data needed to construct the signing key for the `SecSignDest` HTTP header was readily available in the application source code (for the fixed portions) and the HTTP request being sent (for the dynamic portions).

To demonstrate an attacker's ability to perform arbitrary actions on other users' accounts and locks, I have developed a PoC which disconnects a MEGAFEIS smart lock from its legitimate owner, transfers it to the account of a malicious 3rd party, and offers the option to return it to the original account after the lock has been opened. This is achieved solely with the bluetooth MAC address (bd\_addr) of the smart lock (which is trivial to discover) and the credentials to a malicious account which can be created easily.

## Proof-of-Concept

### Pre-Requisites

* Target lock's bluetooth MAC address (bd\_addr)
* Installed DBD+ application
* Valid DBD+ account
* CVE-2022-45636\_PoC.py - `git clone https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm.git`
* Script dependencies - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

```
python3 CVE-2022-45636_PoC.py <bd_addr> <attacker_email/phone>

```

Example: `python3 CVE-2022-45636_PoC.py 7F:06:07:03:0E:CF test@test.com`

### Demo

#### Step 1: Find a MEGAFEIS Smart Lock

To find a target lock, open the DBD+ app and tap the "Add" button. Once a lock advertising its model number is found, record its bluetooth MAC address as it will be needed later on.

[![DBD+ App Main Screen](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/raw/main/screenshots/dbd_app_main_screen.png)](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/screenshots/dbd_app_main_screen.png)[![DBD+ App Discovery Screen](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/raw/main/screenshots/dbd_app_discovery_screen.png)](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/screenshots/dbd_app_discovery_screen.png)

#### Step 2: Perform Lock Takeover

By this stage, you should have installed and created an account on the DBD+ application. Once you have both the lock's MAC address and your account ready, run the script with the correct arguments.

The attack scenario below shows a MEGAFEIS lock bound to a legitimate user's account (dayihed329@chimpad.com). Also shown is an attacker account (diyoveh601@5k2u.com) ready to steal it.

Once the script is downloaded and the dependencies installed, execute it as shown below.

[![Lock Takeover PoC Execution](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/raw/main/screenshots/poc1_execution.png)](/WithSecureLabs/megafeis-palm/blob/main/screenshots/poc1_execution.png)

Once the lock takeover is complete, you should be able to log in to the attacker account and unlock the smart lock. You may also return it to the original owner to avoid suspicion once you have accomplished your objective (for which I bear no responsibility).
