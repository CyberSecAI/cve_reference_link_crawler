The provided document extensively discusses vulnerabilities related to SSL certificate validation in various non-browser applications and libraries, including but not limited to the following:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Badly designed APIs of SSL implementations (JSSE, OpenSSL, GnuTLS) and data transport libraries (cURL), which expose low-level details to developers, leading to misinterpretations and incorrect usage.
- Developers' misunderstanding of SSL library options, parameters, return values and security guarantees.
- Intermediate layers of the software stack silently disabling certificate validation.
- Developers intentionally disabling certificate validation (for testing purposes) without reenabling it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect use of cURL options:** Setting `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` to `true` instead of `2`, which disables proper hostname verification (Amazon Flexible Payments Service PHP, PayPal Payments Standard PHP, PayPal Invoicing PHP).
- **Misinterpretation of GnuTLS return values:** Lynx checks for self-signed certificates only if `gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2` returns a negative value, but this function returns 0 for certain errors like self-signed certificate, causing chain-of-trust verification to fail.
- **Lack of hostname verification in JSSE:** `SSLSocketFactory` silently skips hostname verification if the algorithm field in the SSL client is `NULL` or an empty string (Apache HttpClient 3. *, Weberknecht).
- **Incorrect hostname verification in HttpClient 4.*:**  The custom hostname verification code has bugs and rejects some valid certificates. The regular expression for IPv4 parsing can accept zero padded IP addresses.
- **Failure to check SSL results:**  Trillian does not check the return status of `SSL_get_verify_result` after the connection establishment, resulting in insecure connections.
- **Explicit disabling of certificate validation:** Chase Mobile Banking app on Android overrides the trust manager, effectively disabling certificate validation; many shopping carts and SDKs also disable certificate verification for "compatibility" or testing purposes.
- **Incorrect Regular Expression for Hostname Matching:**  Apache Libcloud uses an incorrect regular expression that can be spoofed via a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Misuse of HttpHost object:** TextSecure uses the `HttpHost` object with `DEFAULT_SCHEME_NAME` set to `http` even when the connection is made to port 443, leading to unencrypted communication.
- **Insecure Default Configurations:** Many libraries default to insecure setups that do not validate certificates unless explicitly configured by the application, which is often not done correctly or at all.
- **Use of inherently insecure libraries/methods:**  Using PHP's `fsockopen` and Python's `urllib`, which do not validate certificates by default, for SSL connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, enabling an attacker to intercept and modify communications.
- Capture of sensitive data, including login credentials, payment information (credit card numbers, addresses, etc.), cloud storage data, and developer credentials.
- Complete compromise of secure communication channels.
- Unauthorized access to user accounts, financial information, and other sensitive resources.
- Ability to impersonate legitimate servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Active network attacker controlling routers, switches, Wi-Fi access points, or DNS.
- DNS poisoning to redirect client connections to attacker-controlled servers.
- Presenting self-signed certificates, certificates with incorrect names, or valid certificates for different domains to vulnerable clients.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Control over network infrastructure (e.g., Wi-Fi access points, routers, DNS servers).
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between client and server.
- Possesion of valid SSL certificates for a server they control.

**Summary of Vulnerable Software:**
* Cloud clients: Amazon EC2 Java library, Elastic Load Balancing API Tools, Apache Libcloud, Rackspace iOS client, ElephantDrive, FilesAnywhere.
* Web services middleware: Apache Axis, Axis 2, Codehaus XFire, Pusher library for Android, Apache ActiveMQ.
* Merchant SDKs: Amazon Flexible Payments Service (Java and PHP), PayPal Payments Standard (PHP), PayPal Payments Pro (Java), PayPal Invoicing (PHP), PayPal Mass Pay (Java), PayPal Transactional Information SOAP (Java).
* Integrated shopping carts: osCommerce, ZenCart, Ubercart, PrestaShop.
* Mobile apps: Chase mobile banking (Android), Breezy, ACRA library for Android.
* Instant messenger clients: Trillian, AIM
* Mobile advertising: AdMob
* Other software: Lynx, Weberknecht, Tweepy, Mozilla's Zamboni project, Groupon Redemptions, TextSecure.

This document provides significant detail about specific vulnerabilities found in non-browser software that rely on SSL and how insecure implementations can expose sensitive data. This information aligns with the general idea of certificate validation issues, however, there is no specific mention of CVE-2012-5786.
