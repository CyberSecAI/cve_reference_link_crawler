- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a NULL-pointer dereference in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user within a guest VM can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user in the guest VM and be able to trigger the vulnerable code path to cause the NULL pointer dereference.
