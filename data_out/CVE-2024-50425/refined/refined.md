- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function but is described as "highly dangerous" and "expected to become mass exploited."
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible to any user including subscriber, which is a low privilege user role in WordPress.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the WordPress site, even a low-privilege subscriber.
