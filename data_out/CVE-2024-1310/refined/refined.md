- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WooCommerce plugin does not properly check user capabilities when displaying products via shortcodes, allowing users with the "contributor" role and higher to access products that they should not have permission to view (private, draft, trashed).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control (CWE-284) vulnerability, specifically related to insufficient checks on user permissions before displaying product information through shortcodes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users with contributor roles or higher can view product information that should be restricted to users with higher privileges, potentially including confidential data from private, draft, and trashed products.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with "contributor" or higher role can create a post and embed a crafted shortcode to retrieve restricted product information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs a valid WordPress account with a "contributor" role or higher. They also need the knowledge of the product ID they wish to access.
