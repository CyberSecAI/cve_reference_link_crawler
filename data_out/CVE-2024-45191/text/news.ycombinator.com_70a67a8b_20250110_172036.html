After all, the limited primitives are commented on in the readme and <https://github.com/matrix-org/olm/issues/3> since day 1. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [mjg59](user?id=mjg59) [4 months ago](item?id=41250171)   | [next](#41249754) [–]  It being unclear that they're exploitable doesn't justify the fact that the reference implementation had known weaknesses that were only documented in the issue tracker and a readme buried several directories deep and not referenced from elsewhere! It also doesn't justify failing to proactively inform any of the clients making use of olm that these issues had been identified, and now anyone who *does* feel that this is inside their code's threat model has to rush to port to the new implementation after public disclosure. Edit: but also if you're going to argue that it's unclear that these issues are remotely exploitable, it'd be helpful to discuss *why* - are there external constraints that ratelimit them such that the number of packets required is infeasible in any length of time? Is all the affected key material ephemeral and rotated before it's realistic to get a large enough sample? Just vibes? | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [some\_furry](user?id=some_furry) [4 months ago](item?id=41249754)   | [prev](#41250171) | [next](#41252417) [–]  > the author literally picked random projects from github tagged as matrix, without considering their prevalence or whether they are actually maintained etc. I was very clear in my methodology: I grabbed everything tagged with that GitHub topic, and filtered out projects that were archived or marked as "old". > meanwhile, it is very unclear that any sidechannel attack on a libolm based client is practical over the network (which is why we didn’t fix this years ago). This is not an attitude that inspires confidence. It's one thing to accidentally ship cryptography code with side-channels. It's another entirely to knowingly do so, and not fix it sooner.
