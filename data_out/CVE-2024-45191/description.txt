An issue was discovered in Matrix libolm through 3.2.16. The AES implementation is vulnerable to cache-timing attacks due to use of S-boxes. This is related to software that uses a lookup table for the SubWord step. This refers to the libolm implementation of Olm. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
