# Blind SSRF in some Detectors

GHSA-3r74-v83p-f4f4
Aug 17, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<v3.81.9

## Patched versions

v3.81.9

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog v3.81.9 and later versions. Users should upgrade to this or a more recent version to mitigate the issue.

*Special thanks to Karan Bamal, Security Researcher at Sentinel One for this discovery*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
