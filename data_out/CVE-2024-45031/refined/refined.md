Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-45031:

**Root Cause:** Incomplete HTML tags bypass HTML sanitization when editing objects in Apache Syncope, which allows for the injection of stored XSS payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This means malicious scripts are not just reflected in a user's browser but are saved within the application itself.
*   **Insufficient HTML Sanitization:** The application's HTML sanitization is not robust enough to handle incomplete HTML tags, allowing for XSS payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject XSS payloads in Syncope Enduser, which then triggers for administrators in Syncope Console. This enables session hijacking as the malicious script can steal session cookies and other sensitive information.
*   **Data Exposure:** Successful XSS attacks could also be leveraged to potentially steal other sensitive data.
*   **Malicious actions:** Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser can be used for various malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Syncope Console:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by editing objects in the Syncope Console with incomplete HTML tags.
*   **Syncope Enduser:** Attackers can inject payloads when editing "Personal Information" or "User Requests" in the Syncope Enduser interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least user-level access in the Syncope instance.
*   **Knowledge of exploitation techniques:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge to craft the XSS payloads using incomplete HTML tags.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Apache Syncope 2.1 through 2.1.14
*   Apache Syncope 3.0 through 3.0.8

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Apache Syncope version 3.0.9 or later to address the vulnerability.
