The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47094.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation of the x86 MMU (Memory Management Unit), specifically within the TDP (Table Descriptor Pointer) MMU iterator. The iterator was incorrectly advancing after yielding (releasing the mmu_lock) during a walk of the page table. This resulted in skipping over entries in the page table, leading to potential use-after-free conditions and memory leaks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect iterator advancement after yielding.
- Missing checks on whether the iterator has yielded when calling helper functions.
- Potential for skipping top-level SPTEs (Shadow Page Table Entries).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Leaks:** If a valid SPTE is skipped by both `kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all()` and `kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root()`, the corresponding shadow page will be leaked.
- **Use-After-Free:** If `kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all()` skips a gfn/SPTE, but that SPTE is then zapped by `kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root()`, it can lead to marking a struct page as dirty/accessed after it has been freed, resulting in use-after-free, which can also lead to data corruption and further kernel errors.
- **Kernel Crashes/Errors:** The use-after-free and incorrect memory handling can lead to kernel warnings and crashes, impacting system stability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during operations involving the TDP MMU, specifically when zapping or managing SPTEs. This occurs in the context of KVM's management of virtual machine memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and manage KVM virtual machines. This typically requires root or privileged access to the host system.
- The attacker would need to trigger the specific scenario in the KVM MMU code where the iterator yields.
