Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin. Specifically, the `onclick` attribute of the button and contact form widgets wasn't properly sanitized before being rendered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows authenticated users (with Contributor access or higher) to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `onclick` attribute of button and contact widgets. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the page containing the widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** Depending on the injected script, an attacker might be able to perform actions on behalf of the victim, including changing user information, creating new admin accounts, etc.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could steal sensitive data, such as cookies or other information stored in the browser.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Widget Configuration:** An attacker with Contributor or higher level access can edit the button or contact form widgets.
- **`onclick` attribute:** The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into the `onclick` attribute of the widget's settings via the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least Contributor level access.
- **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the settings of the SiteOrigin Button or Contact widgets.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin up to and including version 1.58.1.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.58.2.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `onclick` attribute using a combination of a deny list (removing disallowed functions) and an allow list (only allowing specific analytics and tracking functions).
- The `siteorigin_widget_onclick()` function is introduced in the `base/base.php` file to sanitize the `onclick` value. This function is then used in `widgets/button/tpl/default.php` and `widgets/contact/tpl/default.php` instead of directly using `esc_js()` on the user-provided value.
