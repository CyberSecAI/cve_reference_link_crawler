The provided content contains two patches that are related to the same vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel. Both patches address a null pointer dereference issue related to writeback connectors in the AMD display driver.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `create_validate_stream_for_sink` function in the AMD display driver not properly handling writeback connectors. Specifically, the code attempts to access members of the `aconnector` structure without first checking if it is a writeback connector. Writeback connectors do not have the same properties as regular display connectors, which leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to the lack of checks for writeback connectors before accessing their members.
- **Incorrect Handling of Writeback Connectors:** The code incorrectly assumes all connectors have the same structure, failing to account for the unique nature of writeback connectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:**  The most likely impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Display Configuration:** The vulnerability can be triggered through display configuration operations involving writeback connectors. This may include actions like connecting/disconnecting displays, changing display modes, or enabling/disabling writeback functionality.
- **Software Interaction:** An attacker may exploit this through software interacting with the display subsystem, such as display server or custom graphics applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to have some level of access to the system with the ability to influence display settings, such as a local user.
- Specific technical skills related to display subsystem interactions may be required.

**Patch Details:**
The patches address the issue by adding a check at the beginning of the `create_validate_stream_for_sink` function to identify writeback connectors. When a writeback connector is identified, the function immediately returns, preventing the null pointer dereference. Additionally, the code in `dm_update_crtc_state` also checks for the presence of connector before trying to access connector_type.

**Additional Notes**
The commit message states: "This is to check connector type to avoid unhandled null pointer for writeback connectors." which explicitly explains the purpose of the patches. The fix also includes a revert of a previous change that introduced the vulnerability.
The patch also fixes a null-pointer issue in `dm_update_crtc_state` by adding a conditional before attempting to access the connector.
