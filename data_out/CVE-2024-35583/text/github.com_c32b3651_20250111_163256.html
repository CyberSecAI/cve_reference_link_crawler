Executive Summary

Laboratory Management System provides the facility to add Remarks. It has been observed that the input taken from user is not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to inject the malicious JavaScript code in the “Remarks” input field. The malicious code can then be executed whenever the vulnerable web page is accessed by any user and will remain persistent.

The web application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (SXSS) attacks in the "Remarks" input field. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inputting the malicious JavaScript code in the HTTP POST request to create the user.

Impact:

Stored XSS attacks can have serious consequences, such as Account takeover by stealing cookies, stealing sensitive data, modifying the content of the web page, or redirecting users to a malicious sites. Remediation:

Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent malicious code from being injected into the web application. Use server-side validation to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being stored in a database or displayed on a web page. Use output encoding to ensure that any user input that is displayed on the web page is properly encoded to prevent malicious code from being executed. References:
