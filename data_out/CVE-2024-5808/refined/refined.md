- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "WP Ajax Contact Form" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting emails from the email list.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting emails from the plugin's email list without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening the malicious HTML page. The administrator must be logged into the WordPress admin panel at the time the form is submitted.
