Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24309

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable, hardcoded token for accessing sensitive information within the "Survey TMA" module for PrestaShop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The module exposes sensitive technical information to unauthorized users due to a predictable token.
*   **Predictable Token:** The module uses a hardcoded token ("HARDCODED_TOKEN") for authentication, which can be easily guessed or discovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access a range of sensitive technical details without authentication.
*   **Facilitation of Further Attacks:** The exposed information, such as PrestaShop version, module lists, and database details, can be leveraged to facilitate other attacks, such as SQL injection (CWE-89).
*  **GDPR Violation:** The disclosure of commercial statistics is considered a GDPR violation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** Attackers do not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires no user interaction.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `modules/ecomiz_survey_tma/controllers/front/survey.php` file.
*   The original code used a hardcoded token (`HARDCODED_TOKEN`) to authenticate requests.
*   The patch replaces the hardcoded token with a dynamically generated token based on the module name:  `Tools::encrypt($this->module->name)`

**Affected Versions:**
*   "Survey TMA" module versions up to and including 1.2.0 are vulnerable. Version 2.0.0 has the fix.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a code review by TouchWeb.fr
*   The advisory recommends restricting access to all front controller (FC) of the module `ecomiz_survey_tma`.
