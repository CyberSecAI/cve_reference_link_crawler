In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

Add a paranoia check to make sure it doesn't stray beyond valid memory
region containing ocfs2 xattr entries when scanning for a match.  It will
prevent out-of-bound access in case of crafted images.
