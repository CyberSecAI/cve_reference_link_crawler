Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SelectCours system uses a vulnerable version of Thymeleaf where user-controlled input is directly used in template rendering. Specifically, the `/monitor/cache/getNames` endpoint reflects user-provided data back in the response, making it susceptible to SSTI.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the Thymeleaf template engine.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Sensitive information leakage
    *   Arbitrary code execution
    *   Potential for "GetShell" (remote shell access)
*  **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted POST request to `/monitor/cache/getNames` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `fragment` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/monitor/cache/getNames` endpoint of the SelectCours system.

**Technical details:**

*   The system uses a lower version of thymeleaf, which is vulnerable to SSTI.
*   The `/getNames` interface returns user-controlled input, specifically the `fragment` parameter, without proper sanitization, directly into a Thymeleaf template.
*   The provided payload `${T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("calc.exe")}` demonstrates the capability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (POC) showing how to send a crafted POST request and a screenshot demonstrating that code execution has been successful, meaning that it is more descriptive than the generic CVE description.
