# Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability on Axigen for Windows (CVE-2024-28589)

A vulnerability has been discovered in Axigen Mail Server for Windows, affecting all versions up to 10.5.18, which allows for local privilege escalation.

## Details

**Affected versions:** Axigen 10.x up to 10.5.18; [fixed starting with 10.5.19](http://www.axigen.com/updates/axigen-10.5.19)

**Vulnerability type:** Elevation Of Privilege

**Impact:** Code execution, Escalation of Privileges

**Affected components:** Service Initialization

**Attack vectors:** Local

**Description:** The Axigen Mail Server was found to be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to insecure DLL loading from a world-writable directory. During the service initiation of "Axigen Mail Server," which operates with SYSTEM privileges, it searches for a non-existent directory. An attacker with local access can create this directory and place a malicious DLL file in it. When the service starts, it attempts to load all DLL files in this directory, allowing the attacker's code to execute with SYSTEM privileges.

**Axigen's Security Perspective**

We view local privilege escalation vulnerabilities like this one as lower risk, focusing on broader security practices. For insights into our vulnerability assessment, see our [blog post on security realms and threat categories](https://www.axigen.com/articles/understanding-security-realms-and-threat-categories-in-axigen_142.html).
