The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28589.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Axigen Mail Server service attempts to load DLL files from a directory that it searches for during service initiation. This directory is not created by default and is world-writable, which leads to insecure DLL loading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The service loads DLLs from a world-writable directory.
- Privilege escalation: Loading attacker-controlled DLLs allows execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- Escalation of Privileges to SYSTEM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system where Axigen Mail Server is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the target system.
- Ability to create directories and place files within the file system.
