Root cause of vulnerability: The Volmarg Personal Management System 1.4.64 allows uploading of SVG files, which can contain embedded JavaScript.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the uploaded SVG file is viewed. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
  1. The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript.
  2. The victim views the uploaded SVG file within the application.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker must be able to upload files to the application.
  - No special user level needed.

Additional details: The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the XSS vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted SVG file. The SVG contains a `<script>` tag with JavaScript code that executes an `alert(1)`.
