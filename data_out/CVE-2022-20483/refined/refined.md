{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when parsing AVRCP response due to the use of 16-bit min_len, which was changed to 32-bits to avoid the overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure due to possible length checking overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "Parsing of AVRCP responses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted AVRCP response.",
  "Additional details": "The fix also changes memory allocation from malloc to calloc to ensure that string memory in list items is properly cleaned up by the caller."
