## FAQ

### 1. How can I add images to the Photo Gallery

Adding images to photo gallery is pretty straight forward. On the left menu select Photo Gallery > Add Galleries/Images > Add new.

The standard gallery is designed for including both regular images, as well as media from social networking websites, such as Flickr, Instagram and etc.

**Name.** Specify the name of the gallery.

**Slug.** Specify the alias in your website for the gallery.

**Type.** Choose the Mixed type.

**Description.** Fill in the information you would like to share with the gallery. The description will be visible with some of the gallery views.

**Author.** This indicates the author of the gallery. It automatically includes the name of the logged in user, who has added the gallery.

**Published.** Choose whether to publish the gallery or to leave it for the further publication.

**Preview image.** Indicate the image which will be used to preview the gallery. If you leave it blank, it will automatically pick the first uploaded images included in the gallery.

You can add photos by clicking Add Images button.

Photo Gallery plugin is using both standard WordPress Media Library, as well as a Photo Gallery File Manager. You can either click on Media Library button (in advance enabling it from General Options section of the Options menu) and select images to be imported into the Photo Gallery File Manager or click on Upload files and upload the desired images from another location. After uploading images you should mark them and press Add button.

Instead of uploading images you can embed images/videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, Flickr (only images) and Dailymotion.

The following buttons do not work with the Embedded images- Crop, Resize and Reset. In addition you cannot add Watermark over the Embedded imaged.

Here are the standards for adding embedded videos/images:

**Images**

Instagram: http://instagram.com/p/ykvv0puS4u, if you want to add the image together with the post, you can add \_post at the end of the URL.

Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/sui-fong/15250186998/in/gallery-flickr-72157648726328108/

**Videos**

YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4RLje-yM8

Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/8110647

Dailymotion: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xexaq0\_frank-sinatra-strangers-in-the-nigh\_music

**Bulk Embed.** This option will allow adding more than one images from specific social media (currently only Instagram account, but more options will be added with the upcoming updates) into the standard gallery. You should keep in mind that the images will be added without the possibility of auto-update.

**Instagram user.** Set the name of the Instagram user without additional symbols, e.g. jaredleto.

**Number of recent instagram posts to add to gallery.** Specify the number of images you want to add from the stated Instagram account.

**Instagram embed type.** Choose to use only the image content of the Instagram post or the entire post.

### 2. I can’t upload more images to galleries. Media uploader keeps loading.

The problem might be due to the large number of pictures in the main directory of Photo Gallery image uploader. If you already have heavy amount of uploaded images, please try to group them in separate folders.

Take a note, that importing images with WordPress default Media Library can get into a conflict. You can try to disable that option and enable it only when you need to import images to Photo Gallery from there

### 3. Is Photo Gallery responsive?

Photo Gallery plugin has fully responsive design and layout. It is designed to display all of its views nicely regardless of the device dimensions.

In addition you can add the shortcode using Shortcode Generator.

**Generating Shortcode**

To use the created galleries and albums for the custom location, you can generate custom shortcodes of Photo Gallery and edit the created shortcodes.

# Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities Discovered by AppCheck in 10Web PhotoGallery WordPress Plugin

AppCheck has identified multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities within the popular “Photo Gallery” Wordpress plugin by 10Web. Full vulnerability detail and remediation advice within.

AppCheck has identified multiple [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://appcheck-ng.com/cross-site-scripting/) vulnerabilities within the popular “Photo Gallery” WordPress plugin by 10Web.

The plugin is used to create mobile-friendly media galleries for WordPress websites. The vendor 10Web describes it as:

***“Photo Gallery is the leading plugin for building beautiful mobile-friendly galleries in a few minutes.”***

According to wordpress.org. there are 200,000 active installations of the plugin.

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/photo-gallery/>

## Vulnerability Solution

Upgrade the plugin to version 1.8.22 or later.

## Cross-Site Scripting Background

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when data submitted to the application is not properly sanitized before being embedded within the application’s response or stored for later retrieval.

Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited by embedding malicious script code within links to the application. The attacker would then attempt to trick the user into following the maliciously crafted link via a social engineering attack such as a Phishing email.

Upon clicking the malicious link, the embedded script code is inserted into the server’s response and executed within user’s web browser.

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (sometimes referred to second order or persistent XSS), operates in a similar way except the script code is stored by the application and could allow users of the application to be targeted even without following a specific link from the attacker.

The payload of an XSS attack can achieve anything that a legitimate script within the page can. For example, the injected script can read client-side data such as authentication tokens, carry out actions on behalf of the user (such as edit page content if the user has permission to do so), or serve up malware or misleading information to the user.

## Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-29832)

The current\_url parameter of the AJAX call to the GalleryBox action of admin-ajax.php is vulnerable to reflected Cross Site Scripting. The value of the current\_url parameter is embedded within an existing JavaScript within the response allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be inserted and executed. No authentication is required to exploit this issue.

Note that other parameters within a AJAX call, such as image\_id, must be valid for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.

Example:

[![](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-1.png)](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-1.png)

If successful, an alert box displaying the text “xss” will be displayed.

[![](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CVE-2024-29832-Screenshot-1.png)](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CVE-2024-29832-Screenshot-1.png)

The screenshot below shows the code being injected:

## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability 2 (CVE-2024-29808, CVE-2024-29809, CVE-2024-298010)

A similar issue affects the “editimage\_bwg” AJAX action, in this case the target user needs to be logged in with permission to access this feature. From the attackers perspective this is still an attractive proposition, however its something to be aware of when recreating this issue.

The “image\_id” **(CVE-2024-29808)**, “image\_url” **(CVE-2024-29809)** and “thumb\_url” **(CVE-2024-29810)** parameters are all affected.

E**xample: image\_id parameter**

**Example: image\_url**

[![](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-3.png)](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-3.png)

**Example: thumb\_url**

[![](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-4.png)](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10Web-PhotoGallery-URL-4.png)

##

## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability 3 (CVE-2024-29833)

The image uploader feature has some code designed to strip <script> tags from SVG images for security purposes. The code can be found in **photo-gallery\filemanager\UploadHandler.php**

The following lines are responsible for removing scripts:

*// Remove scripts from SVG files for security reasons.*

*$file\_content = file\_get\_contents($file\_path);*

*file\_put\_contents($file\_path, preg\_replace(‘#<script(.\*?)>(.\*?)</script>#is’, ”, $file\_content));*

This regular expression can be easily bypassed to inject a script that does not match the expression but still executes as normal. There are many ways to do this, for example, adding a single space at the end of the closing script tag such as </script> becomes </script >.

Here is an example:

*<?xml version=”1.0″ standalone=”no”?>*

*<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN” “http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd”>*

*<svg version=”1.1″ baseProfile=”full” xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”>*

*<polygon id=”triangle” points=”0,0 0,50 50,0″ fill=”#009900″ stroke=”#004400″/>*

*<script type=”text/javascript”>*

*alert(‘XSS!’);*

*</script >*

*</svg>*

Note that we get a resizing error message, but the file is still uploaded and accessible.
