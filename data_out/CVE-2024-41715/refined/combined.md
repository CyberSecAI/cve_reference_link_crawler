## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin, a mesh networking device, are affected:

* goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin: Versions 1.9.12 and prior

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**Weak Password Requirements CWE-521**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html)

The goTenna Pro ATAK plugin uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via the key broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF, and password is cracked via brute force attack, it is possible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This only applies when the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional feature, so it is advised to use local QR encryption key sharing for additional security on this and previous versions.

[CVE-2024-45374](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45374) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2024-45374](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45374). A base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

#### **3.2.2** [**Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information CWE-922**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/922.html)

In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the End User Device (EUD). This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the EUD if physically compromised. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on encryption keys stored on the EUD. This requires access to and control of the EUD, so it is recommended to use strong access control measures and layered encryption on the EUD for more secure operation.

[CVE-2024-43694](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43694) has been assigned to this vulnerability.
