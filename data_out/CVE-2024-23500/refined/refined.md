- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the website to make requests to an arbitrary domain, potentially leading to the discovery of sensitive information on other services running on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can send crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin, leading the server to initiate requests to an attacker-controlled domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the vulnerable functionality. The required privilege for exploitation is "Contributor".
