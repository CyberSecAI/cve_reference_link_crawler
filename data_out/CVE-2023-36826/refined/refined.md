Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks in the `debug_files` and `artifact_lookup` endpoints of Sentry. Specifically, file downloads were not properly restricted to the specific project based on route parameters. This allowed authenticated users to download debug and artifact bundles from arbitrary organizations and projects, even without the necessary membership or permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks. The system failed to verify if the authenticated user had the necessary permissions to access the requested files for the specific project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could download debug and artifact bundles from any organization and project if they knew the bundle ID, regardless of their membership or permissions. This could expose sensitive information contained within these bundles.
*   **Data Leakage:** Exposure of debug files and artifact bundles can reveal sensitive application details, source code snippets, API keys and other crucial information that could be leveraged to further compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Direct Request to API endpoint:** An authenticated user could directly request the vulnerable API endpoint with a known bundle ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Sentry platform, but doesn't need to be a member of the target organization or have permissions on the project.
*   **Knowledge of Bundle ID:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the debug or artifact bundle they wish to download.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to retrieve debug or artifact bundles.
*   Sentry SaaS users were not required to take any action as the fix was deployed on the server side.
*   Self-Hosted Sentry users needed to upgrade to version 23.5.2 or higher to remediate the vulnerability.
*   The fix was introduced by the pull request "[Restrict file downloads to Project](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/49680)".
