# Improper authorization on debug and artifact file downloads

High

[mdtro](/mdtro)
published
GHSA-m4hc-m2v6-hfw8
Jul 25, 2023

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=8.21.0, <23.5.2

## Patched versions

23.5.2

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user can download a debug or artifact bundle from arbitrary organizations and projects with a known bundle ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project.

### Patches

A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to retrieve debug or artifact bundles. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions on the particular project are no longer able to download them.

**Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) users should upgrade to version 23.5.2 or higher.**

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
