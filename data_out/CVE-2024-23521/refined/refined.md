Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the Happyforms WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of proper checks to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action. This is a classic broken access control vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact of this vulnerability is described as low, and it's deemed unlikely to be exploited. While the specific impact is not mentioned, it's clear that an unprivileged user would be able to perform an action normally restricted to users with higher privileges. The provided content mentions that "specific impact varies case by case."

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves an unauthenticated user exploiting the missing access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker doesn't need to be authenticated (i.e., be logged into the WordPress site) to exploit this vulnerability.
