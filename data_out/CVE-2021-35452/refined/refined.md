Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `slice_segment_header::read` function within the `slice.cc` file. It involves an incorrect memory access while reading slice segment header data. Specifically, a read from memory location `rsi+0x7fff8000` is performed without proper bounds checking, with `rsi` potentially not pointing to a valid memory address

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary issue is an incorrect access control that leads to an out-of-bounds read. The code attempts to read a byte from a memory address that may not belong to the allocated memory, leading to a segmentation fault.
*   **Segmentation Fault:** The out-of-bounds read causes a segmentation fault, crashing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The application crashes when it encounters a crafted input, preventing it from processing further data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HEVC/H.265 Bitstream:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed or specially crafted HEVC/H.265 bitstream. An attacker can craft a video file that causes the vulnerable code to execute the out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **File Input:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious video file to the `dec265` decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed or crafted HEVC/H.265 bitstream to the vulnerable `libde265` library.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges or access to the system, other than the ability to provide a malicious video file to the affected application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub issue report includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) zip file that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue was fixed by adding a check for a valid PPS index.
*   The vulnerability affects libde265 version 1.0.8.
*   Debian security advisories DSA-5346-1 and DLA-3240-1 mention this CVE and the fix.
