Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Kahuna theme for WordPress, versions 1.7.0 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The specific vulnerable code or input vector is not detailed in this content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The theme is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject scripts into the website. These scripts can then be used to:
*   Redirect users to malicious sites.
*   Display unwanted advertisements.
*   Inject other arbitrary HTML content.
*   Potentially perform other malicious actions by executing scripts in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website, likely through user input or other methods where the theme does not properly sanitize/escape output. The specifics of this injection are not included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script code into the vulnerable part of the Kahuna theme. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor", suggesting that an attacker with this level of access or a vulnerability that allows user input to be rendered without sanitization could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
