{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow was identified in the `gen_alias_map` function within the `jpegxl_parser.c` file of the FFmpeg library. This overflow occurs when parsing a crafted JPEG XL file due to insufficient bounds checking when processing distribution bundles.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service. An attacker could potentially overwrite stack memory with malicious data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted JPEG XL file to FFmpeg for processing. This could occur through a variety of attack vectors, including websites, email attachments, or other means where an attacker can control the input data processed by FFmpeg.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious crafted JPEG XL file as input to a vulnerable application using the affected FFmpeg library. This could potentially be done through a local file or a remote stream where the attacker controls the content being processed."
