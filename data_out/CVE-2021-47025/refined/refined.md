The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47025.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper handling of clock (clk) enabling/disabling during the resume and suspend operations of the MediaTek IOMMU driver in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `mtk_iommu_runtime_resume` function was not always enabling the clock, leading to a scenario where the suspend callback could attempt to disable an already disabled clock, causing a warning and potential issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition or incorrect state handling during power management transitions (suspend/resume) leading to double clock disable.
- Improper clock management logic in the `mtk_iommu_runtime_resume` and `mtk_iommu_runtime_suspend` functions.
- Missing check for clock state before attempting to disable it

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a warning message and a potential software race condition when the suspend routine tries to disable a clock already disabled by the resume callback
- It could lead to system instability or unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through normal system power management transitions (suspend and resume).
- No direct external attacker control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position are required. The issue is triggered by normal system operation.
