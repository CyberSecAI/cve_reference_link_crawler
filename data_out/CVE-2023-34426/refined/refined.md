- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `manage_request` function of the Yifan YF325 router due to insufficient bounds checking when handling URL paths starting with `/tmp/sd`. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to copy the `URL_path_no_root` into the `tmp_buff` without validating its length, leading to a buffer overflow if the `URL_path_no_root` is too large.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) in the `manage_request` function.
  - Lack of input validation on the size of the `URL_path_no_root` before copying it into the fixed-size `tmp_buff`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the router.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network request to the router's HTTP service. The specific request must contain a URL path that starts with `/tmp/sd` and is long enough to overflow the `tmp_buff`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability as it occurs before the authentication check.
