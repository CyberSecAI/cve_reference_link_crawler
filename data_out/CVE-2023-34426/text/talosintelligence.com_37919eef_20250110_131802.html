# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1766

## Yifan YF325 httpd manage\_request stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### October 11, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-34426

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the httpd manage\_request functionality of Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108. A specially crafted network request can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108

##### PRODUCT URLS

YF325 - <https://yifanwireless.com/entry-level-wifi-router/yf325-series-gprs/3g/4g-wifi-router-with-sim-card-slot.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The Yifan YF325 is an industrial cellular router. This device is designed for M2M and IOT applications, allowing remote management, offering several VPN services and many other features.

The YF325 router provides a series of APIs. The initial function that parses the request before dispatching it to the right function, based on the requested API, is `manage_request`:

```
void manage_request(void)

{
    [...]
    memset(request_method,0,10000);
    is_equal = wfgets(request_method,10000,(char *)CLIENT_REQUEST_FD);
    [... performs some checks and parse the received data ...]

    URL_path = request_method;
    strsep(&URL_path," ");
    [... performs some checks and parse the received data ...]
    URL_path_no_root = URL_path + 1;
    [...]
    is_equal = strncmp(URL_path_no_root,"tmp/sd",6);
    if (is_equal == 0) {                                                                                        [1]
        memset(tmp_buff,0,0x80);
        sprintf(tmp_buff,"/%s",URL_path_no_root);                                                               [2]
        strcpy(URL_path_no_root,tmp_buff);                                                                      [3]
    }
    [...]
}

```

This function receives and parses the head of the request. The `manage_request` function navigates through an array of API structures, each of which contain the URL endpoints that the API manages. Once matched with the correct URL, the request will be dispatched to the matching API. However, for some URL paths, there is a “pre-processing” part. For instance, at `[1]`, there is the code block used to manage the requests that starts with `/tmp/sd`. The variable `URL_path_no_root` corresponds to the request’s URL path without the first `/`.

The block of code that manages the request that has a URL path that starts with `tmp/sd` will, at `[2]`, copy the `URL_path_no_root` into `tmp_buff`, a static buffer, to add the previously removed first `/`. Then at `[3]` the `tmp_buff` is copied into `URL_path_no_root` to complete the process. This process is performed because later on the the `URL_path_no_root`, for this specific case, is going to be used to fetch a file from the filesystem. This “pre-processing” is performed using using `sprintf` to add the a slash as first character and store the result in a temporary buffer. Because no checks are performed on the length of the URL path provided, the `manage_request` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that can occur at `[2]`. This code is reached prior to authentication.
