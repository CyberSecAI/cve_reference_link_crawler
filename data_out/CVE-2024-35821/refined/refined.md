Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35821:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the UBIFS (Unsorted Block Image File System) within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `SetPageUptodate()` function, which marks a page in the page cache as valid and up-to-date, was being called before the page was actually populated with the new data during a write operation.
*  **Weakness:** Page cache reads are lockless. Setting a page as uptodate before the new data has been written to it introduces a race condition. Concurrent readers might access the page and read stale or incorrect data before the write operation is complete. This is an information leak and a data corruption vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Information Leak:** Readers could obtain old, stale data from the page cache which is incorrect.
    *   **Data corruption**: The incorrect data is being read, which could result in system instability
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker could trigger write operations to UBIFS to trigger this race condition and potentially read stale data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A local user with the ability to write to a UBIFS filesystem can trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves moving the call to `SetPageUptodate(page)` from the beginning of write operation into the `ubifs_write_end()` function. The `ubifs_write_end()` is called after the new data has been copied into the page, which ensures that the page is only marked as up-to-date after the write is completed. The patch also adds `ClearPageChecked(page)` and `ClearPageUptodate(page)` at the beginning of the write operation if read was skipped.

**Patch details:**

The provided patches show the changes made in `fs/ubifs/file.c`.

* The `SetPageUptodate(page)` and `ClearPageError(page)` calls, which were previously located in `write_begin_slow` and `ubifs_write_begin`, are removed.
*   `ClearPageChecked(page)` is added to `ubifs_write_begin` if read is skipped.
*   The `SetPageUptodate(page)` call is added to `ubifs_write_end` which ensures that the page is only marked as up-to-date after the write operation is completed.
*   The page is marked as private in `ubifs_write_end` if it is not already.

**CVE Description:**
The provided content does not contain an official CVE description, it contains information to mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The commit messages indicate that this was a race condition introduced when the UBIFS was created.
*   The fix was backported to older kernel versions.
*   The Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3842-1) lists CVE-2024-35821 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the linux-5.10 package.

**In Summary:**

The vulnerability in CVE-2024-35821 is due to a race condition when writing data to UBIFS, and improper marking of the page cache as valid, allowing local users to potentially read incorrect data. The fix involves reordering the call to `SetPageUptodate` to occur after the write operation has completed.
