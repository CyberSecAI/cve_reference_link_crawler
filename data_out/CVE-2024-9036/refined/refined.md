Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and sanitization in the `admin_add.php` file of the Online-Bookstore-Project-In-PHP-Source-Code v1.0. Specifically, the script directly uses the `$_FILES` variable to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files of any type and size without any restrictions. This is because the filename and content are not validated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** Attackers can potentially overwrite existing files on the server.
- **File Injection:** Attackers can upload malicious scripts (e.g., PHP, HTML, JS) and inject them into the web application.
- **Directory Traversal Attacks:** Attackers could potentially manipulate file paths during upload to place files in arbitrary locations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading very large files, attackers may cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can upload and execute malicious PHP files, leading to RCE. This allows for complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface for adding new books to the online bookstore. The vulnerable file is `admin_add.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be able to access the `admin_add.php` functionality of the web application. This typically involves being logged in with an administrative role.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request to the admin\_add.php file to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can send a multipart form data request including the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by uploading a PHP file (`321.php`) containing the `system("ipconfig");` command, which when accessed via HTTP request, executes the command on the server and returns the output.
- The vulnerability is located on line 30 of `admin_add.php`, where the script takes user controlled input from the `$_FILES` array and uses it in file storage operations.
