Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35807:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content is directly related to the fix for a vulnerability in the ext4 filesystem during online resize, which aligns with the description and the patch provided in the commit message.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `ext4_flex_group_add` function not properly handling the transition to meta block groups during online resizing of ext4 file systems. Specifically, it did not check if the group being added was already part of a meta block group, leading to incorrect updates of backup group descriptors. This was introduced by the online resizing support for meta_bg.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Metadata Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect logic in `ext4_flex_group_add` during online resizing, specifically regarding the handling of meta block groups.
-   **Missing Check:** The code lacked a check to determine if a block group being added was already part of a meta block group.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **File System Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to corruption of the ext4 file system during online resizing. This corruption occurs at the backup of the meta block group's block descriptor, potentially leading to data loss or inconsistencies.
-  The corruption can be detected by file checksum changes after resizing.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Online Resize:** The vulnerability is triggered during the online resizing of an ext4 filesystem that is larger than 16 TiB with 4k block size or a smaller file system with `resize_inode` turned off.
-   **Specific Boundary Crossing:** The corruption is more likely to occur when the online resize crosses an 8 GiB boundary (the size of a meta block group in the provided setup).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **System Access:** An attacker requires the ability to perform online resizing of an ext4 filesystem and must have knowledge of how to trigger the issue (e.g., resize across a meta block group boundary when resize\_inode is disabled).
-  The attacker would likely need to be an administrator or have elevated privileges to mount, resize and modify the ext4 filesystem.

**7. Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs when the file system is converted to meta_bg mode, which is when the block groups start after 16 GiB. 
- The `s_first_meta_bg` value specifies the starting meta group, and any block groups added before this point should not be considered part of the meta block group
- The fix introduces a check (`gdb_num >= le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_meta_bg)`) to ensure that the group being added is actually part of the meta block group before updating its backup descriptor.

**8. Patch:**

The fix modifies the line calculating `meta_bg` in `fs/ext4/resize.c`

```
This adds a check to determine if the group to add is already part of the meta block group or not, effectively preventing the incorrect update of the block descriptor backups and, subsequently, file system corruption.
