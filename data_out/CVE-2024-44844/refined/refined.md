{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/www/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` file does not properly filter the values of related fields when processing requests, specifically the `name` field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection due to insufficient filtering of special characters, specifically space and '&', in the `filter_string` function. The `name` parameter is passed to the `run_command` function after insufficient filtering.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` with a malicious payload in the `name` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an active session cookie, and the ability to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface."
