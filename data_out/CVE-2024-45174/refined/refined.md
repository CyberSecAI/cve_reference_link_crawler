Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45174

**Root Cause:**
- The C-MOR video surveillance system's web interface fails to properly validate user-supplied data, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to improper handling of user inputs within SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in the context of the MySQL database used by the application.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and potentially complete control over the database server.
- The attacker could dump the MySQL database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating URL parameters in the web interface, specifically the "cam" parameter.
  - vulnerable pages:
    - `list-timelapse.plm`
    - `list-motion.plm`
    - `show-movies.plm`
  - a further SQL injection vulnerability was found via the URL parameter "c" on the page `getpic.pml` in version 6.00PL01

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the C-MOR web interface, implying the attacker needs valid credentials to log in.
- Network access to the vulnerable C-MOR system is also required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was successfully exploited using the `sqlmap` tool.
- Both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques were demonstrated.
- The advisory notes that while some SQL injection vulnerabilities were fixed in version 6.00PL01, others still exist.
- The vendor has been notified, but no complete fix is available as of the time of the advisory.
