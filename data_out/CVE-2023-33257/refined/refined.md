The provided content describes a vulnerability in Verint Live-chat, specifically an HTML injection flaw.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when creating a new chat session. Specifically, the `customerFirstName`, `customerEmail`, `customerLocale`, and `refererURL` parameters within the API call are vulnerable to HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **HTML injection:** The application does not sanitize or encode user-provided input before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected HTML code is rendered in the Verint dashboard when an employee opens the chat, potentially allowing for:
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that could be executed within the context of the employee's browser, potentially stealing credentials, session cookies, or performing other actions.
    - **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the chat interface in the dashboard.
    - **Phishing:** The attacker could inject elements to create a fake login form and phish employee credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted API request to create a new chat, injecting malicious HTML code in the `customerFirstName`, `customerEmail`, `customerLocale`, and `refererURL` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make API calls to the Verint Live-chat server. This typically requires being able to interact with the chat functionality on the public-facing web application that is using the Verint Live-chat component.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a chat session request.
