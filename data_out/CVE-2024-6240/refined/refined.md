- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in Parallels Desktop. An attacker can add malicious code to a script and set the BASH_ENV environment variable to point to it. This script then executes upon application startup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management (CWE-269). The application does not properly control the execution environment, allowing an attacker-controlled script to execute with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be able to modify the BASH_ENV environment variable. This likely implies some level of access, but the specific vector is not elaborated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the BASH_ENV environment variable and inject a malicious script. The specific method of achieving this is not mentioned.
