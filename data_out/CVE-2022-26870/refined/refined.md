- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain "service" account access. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected system, potentially leading to data breaches, system disruption or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication and can perform the attack over the network. The attacker needs to target a system with both Remote Secure Credential and External SSH features enabled.
