Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an unchecked parameter value within M-Files Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unchecked Parameter Value:** The server fails to properly validate or sanitize a parameter, leading to an exploitable condition.
*   **Uncaught Exception:** The unchecked parameter value leads to an uncaught exception within the server software.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The uncaught exception crashes the M-Files Server, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is the server becoming unavailable, disrupting normal operations for users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Anonymous Access:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the M-Files server.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials for the system.

**Additional Details**

*   **Affected Versions:** M-Files Server versions prior to 23.6.12695.3 are affected (excluding 23.2 SR2 and newer).
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High Severity)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
*   **CWE:** CWE-248 (Uncaught Exception)
*   **CAPEC:** CAPEC-129 (Pointer Manipulation)
