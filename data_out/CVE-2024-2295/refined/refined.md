Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the `[xyz-cfm-form]` shortcode of the Contact Form Manager plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided attributes in the shortcode, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a page containing the malicious shortcode is accessed, the injected JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser.
- **Various Malicious Activities:** Attackers could perform various malicious actions such as:
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Steal session cookies.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code via shortcode attributes within the `[xyz-cfm-form]` shortcode

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be logged in with at least Contributor-level permissions to create or edit content, which includes the ability to use shortcodes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Contact Form Manager versions up to and including 1.6.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.2.
- The provided changelog also mentions "Patch security vulnerability" in version 1.6.1.
- The fix implemented in version 1.6.2 involved adding a new option called `xyz_cfm_nlm_code` and using it in the `create-contact-form.php` file, which seems to be related to Newsletter Manager plugin integration rather than the XSS vulnerability itself. The fix for XSS likely involved sanitization or escaping of user input within the `[xyz-cfm-form]` shortcode handling, which isn't shown in detail in the provided files.
- The Wordfence article specifically states the vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, however, the provided changeset does not have changes to sanitization or escaping functions, so the patch might have been implemented in other files that were not provided, or the changelog is not detailed enough.
