Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-45151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OAuth2 client secrets were being stored in plain text within the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-313):** The primary vulnerability was that the client secrets for OAuth2 were stored as plain text in the database, making them easily accessible to anyone with database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the database or a database backup could retrieve the plain text client secrets.
- With these secrets, the attacker could potentially impersonate the Nextcloud server and gain access to user accounts or resources on third-party services linked through OAuth2.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Access:** The primary attack vector involves unauthorized access to the Nextcloud server's database.
- **Database Backup Access:** Attackers could also obtain the client secrets through access to unencrypted backups of the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have high privilege access to the database or an unencrypted database backup. The vulnerability requires high privileges to access the database, and a network attack vector. The attack complexity is low and no user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by encrypting the OAuth2 client secrets before storing them in the database.
- Patched versions include Nextcloud Server 25.0.8, 26.0.3, and 27.0.1, as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server on the same versions.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.5
- The GitHub content provides more detail than the official CVE description placeholder, including the root cause, impact, and affected versions.
