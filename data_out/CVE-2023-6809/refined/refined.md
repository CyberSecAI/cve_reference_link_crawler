Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6809:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The Wordfence article explicitly mentions `CVE-2023-6809` and provides a description that aligns with the typical characteristics of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is located in the WordPress plugin "Custom fields shortcode".  The provided wordpress.org content relates to a different plugin "beepress", which is explicitly stated to have been closed due to a "Security Issue", but there is no direct connection with CVE-2023-6809. The wordfence article also refers to the "beepress" plugin, but only as a reference. Therefore, only the wordfence.com content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied custom post meta values when using the plugin's `cf` shortcode. This allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - The primary vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various impacts such as:
      - Session hijacking
      - Defacement
      - Redirection to malicious websites
      - Stealing of user data.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through the plugin's `cf` shortcode. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a custom post meta value. This code is then executed when the page with the shortcode is accessed.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions. This allows the attacker to create or modify posts with custom fields, injecting malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerable plugin is named "Custom fields shortcode" and its slug is `custom-fields-shortcode`.
* The affected version is all versions up to and including 0.1.
* There is no patch available at the time of this analysis. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it can be exploited.
