Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security advisory IBEXA-SA-2022-001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Filename Sanitization:** When image files are uploaded, the system uses a name similar to the original filename. The sanitization process for these filenames was insufficient, leading to potential injection attacks.
*   **Lack of Access Control on Direct Image Access:** Direct access to the uploaded images was not access-controlled. This was a design choice for performance reasons but allowed access to images if their path and filename could be deduced or guessed, even if those images were intended to be private.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Injection Vulnerability:**  Insufficient sanitization of image filenames allowed for potential injection attacks through the filename itself. The specific type of injection is not defined in this text.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of access control meant that an attacker could potentially gain access to images that were not meant to be publicly available by guessing or deducing the file path/name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Injection Attacks:** The impact of successful injection attacks depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Images:** Attackers could access private or sensitive images by guessing or deducing file paths and names. This could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading images with specially crafted filenames.
*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access images through URLs if they can deduce or guess the path and filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Image Upload Access:** Attackers need the ability to upload images to the system.
*   **Knowledge/Guessing of Image Paths:** For unauthorized image access, attackers need the ability to deduce, guess, or discover the correct path and filename for target images.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix involves a two-pronged approach:
    1.  Improved sanitization of image filenames to prevent injection attacks.
    2.  Prepending a 12-character secure random hash to the filename to make unauthorized access significantly more difficult.
*  The advisory provides a command to apply the fix to existing images, and also mentions the need to clear caches.
*  The advisory names the versions impacted and the versions containing the fix.
