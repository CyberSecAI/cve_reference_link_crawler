The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in the `streamlit-geospatial` project. CVE-2024-41116 is associated with `GHSL-2024-104`, which is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in `pages/1_ðŸ“·_Timelapse.py` related to the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` option's `vis_params`.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The application takes user-provided input for visualization parameters (`vis_params`) and uses it within an `eval()` function. This allows the user to execute arbitrary Python code.

**Vulnerability:**

- Uncontrolled use of `eval()` with user input: The application directly evaluates user-provided strings, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the `streamlit-geospatial` application. This can lead to full control of the server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- User input through the `Enter visualization parameters` text area in the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` section of the `ðŸ“· Timelapse` tab.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's web interface and provide malicious input into the `Enter visualization parameters` text area when the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` option is selected.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in `pages/1_ðŸ“·_Timelapse.py` at line 1254 where the `vis_params` variable is defined and then evaluated using `eval()` at line 1345 within the conditional block where `collection == "MODIS Ocean Color SMI"`.

```python
vis_params = st.text_area(
    "Enter visualization parameters",
    "",
    help="Enter a string in the format of a dictionary, such as '{'min': 23, 'max': 32}'",
)

--- snip

        elif collection == "MODIS Ocean Color SMI":
            if vis_params.startswith("{") and vis_params.endswith(
                "}"
            ):
                vis_params = eval(vis_params)
```
**Mitigation:**
The provided commit diff shows that the `eval()` calls were replaced with `json.loads()`, which will prevent the execution of arbitrary code. Additionally, a check was added to ensure the input is a dictionary.
