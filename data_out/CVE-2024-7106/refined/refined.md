**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Spina CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link to trigger the request. The attacker needs no direct access to the application, as the request will be performed by the logged-in victim's browser on their behalf.
