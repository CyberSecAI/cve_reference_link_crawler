## FAQ

### How to configure demo import?

Theme authors can can set up demo imports easily by using the `sd/edi/importer/config` filter. A sample configuration can be found in the ‚Äúsamples‚Äù folder within the plugin directory.

Please note that three mandatory files need to be exported from the theme demo: **XML File, Customizer File, and Widget File**. The XML file (.xml) needs to be renamed as `content.xml`, the Customizer file (.dat) as `customizer.dat`, and the widget file (.wie) as `widget.wie`, after that these files will be automatically recognized by the demo importer.

For step-by-step instructions on integrating your theme with the Easy Demo Importer, please check out the **[Developer Docs](https://docs.sigmadevs.com/easy-demo-importer/developer-docs/)** in the Easy Demo Importer Documentation.

### How can I see the demo importer in action?

A sample configuration is provided in the *plugin directory -> samples* folder. It is configured to work with the default **Twenty Twenty-One** theme.

To see the importer in action, simply require the `sample-config.php` file within your theme‚Äôs `functions.php`. It will even work in the localhost.

The link of a **sample .zip file** is provided in the plugin documentation. Kindly look for it in the information note of the **[Configuring the Demo Import with PHP](https://docs.sigmadevs.com/easy-demo-importer/php-configuration/#sd-toc-configuring-the-demo-import-with-php)** section.

### Where is the demo import page?

If your theme is correctly configured, you can find the demo import page with all the demos in *Dashboard -> Appearance -> Easy Demo Importer*.

### How can I export any required plugin settings to include in the demo import?

Please refer to the **[Exporting Settings as JSON](https://docs.sigmadevs.com/easy-demo-importer/theme-integration/#sd-toc-exporting-settings-as-json)** section in the Easy Demo Importer plugin documentation for detailed instructions on exporting various settings as JSON files.

### I can‚Äôt import the demo. It is saying there are errors. What can I do?

Commonly, errors encountered during the demo import process are often associated with the relatively smaller `max_execution_time` or server timeout settings. A practical first step is to inspect the built-in **Appearance -> Easy System Status** page, which can provide insights into any problematic server parameters. Once these issues are fixed, your demo import should work smoothly.

For a comprehensive guide on debugging import issues, please refer to the **[Troubleshooting](https://docs.sigmadevs.com/easy-demo-importer/troubleshooting/)** within the Easy Demo Importer plugin documentation. This page provides detailed steps to troubleshoot and resolve common import-related issues.
