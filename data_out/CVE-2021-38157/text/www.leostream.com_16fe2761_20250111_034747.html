### Why we love Cookies

We use cookies to try and give you a better experience in Freshdesk.

You can learn more about what kind of cookies we use, why, and how from our [Privacy policy](https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/). If you hate cookies, or are just on a diet, you can disable them altogether too. Just note that the Freshdesk service is pretty big on some cookies (we love the choco-chip ones), and some portions of Freshdesk may not work properly if you disable cookies.

We’ll also assume you agree to the way we use cookies and are ok with it as described in our [Privacy policy](https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/), unless you choose to disable them altogether through your browser.
