- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient escaping of the user-supplied 'b2sSortPostType' parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending additional SQL queries to existing ones.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is possible via the 'b2sSortPostType' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher are required.
