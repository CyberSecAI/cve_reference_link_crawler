| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2256540#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-01-02 22:06:53 UTC  ``` ZDI-CAN-22744 - VULNERABILITY DETAILS * Version tested:1.21.1.7 * Installer file:- * Platform tested:debian-live-12.2.0-amd64-xfce.iso  ### Analysis  The exploit doesn't work if the OS installed on vmware and default virtualbox it works on virtualbox with VBoxVGA graphic controller  XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent() function allocated the fixed length array for struct xXIHierarchyInfo. However, If a device with a given ID was removed and a new device with the same ID added the info structs might be written to the array of struct xXIHierarchyInfo twice and over the size limit. It leads to heap overflow and LPE for some distributions (xorg in debian xfce is run as root under specific display driver) and RCE for ssh x11 forwarding environment.
