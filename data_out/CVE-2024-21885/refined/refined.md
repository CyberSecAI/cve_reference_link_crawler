{
  "CVE-2024-21885": {
    "Description": "The XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function in xorg-x11-server has a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. When certain new device IDs are added to the xXIHierarchyInfo struct, it is possible to exceed the allocated array length which can trigger a heap overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap buffer overflow in the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function due to exceeding the allocated array length.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Application crash or remote code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments. Privilege escalation is also a possibility in some distributions (e.g., Debian XFCE)",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation can occur via crafted X11 events, particularly in environments utilizing SSH X11 forwarding. The vulnerability can be triggered by adding devices with certain IDs, leading to a heap overflow.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have the ability to send specific X11 events, which could be achieved in an SSH X11 forwarding or similar environment."
