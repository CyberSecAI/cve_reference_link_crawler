- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly restrict membership of a child site when the "Limit membership to members of the parent site" option is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system allows remote authenticated users to add users who are not members of the parent site to a child site, bypassing the intended membership restrictions. This leads to an authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could grant unauthorized users the ability to perform actions in the child site that they would not normally have permission for, potentially including access to sensitive data and manipulation of the site.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote authenticated user can add a user who is not a member of the parent site to a child site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Liferay portal.
