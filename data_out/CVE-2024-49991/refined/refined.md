{
  "CVE-2024-49991": {
    "description": "The issue is in the `amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem` function within the AMD KFD driver. The function was incorrectly passing the memory object to `amdgpu_bo_unref`.  Instead of passing a pointer to the pointer, it was passing the pointer directly. Consequently, the `amdgpu_bo_unref` function was operating on a local variable and not nullifying the actual memory object pointer. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability because the original pointer wasn't being set to NULL after the memory was freed.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect pointer usage in `amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem` function when calling `amdgpu_bo_unref`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability could lead to a crash, denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would involve triggering the `amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem` function with a crafted scenario where the freed memory is accessed afterward.",
    "required_capabilities": "Requires a local user with access to the AMD KFD driver interface. It would likely require specific ioctl calls to allocate and free the memory, and then trigger a use of the freed memory."
