In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: amdkfd_free_gtt_mem clear the correct pointer

Pass pointer reference to amdgpu_bo_unref to clear the correct pointer,
otherwise amdgpu_bo_unref clear the local variable, the original pointer
not set to NULL, this could cause use-after-free bug.
