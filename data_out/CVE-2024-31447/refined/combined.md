# Improper Session Handling in store-api account logout

Moderate

published
GHSA-5297-wrrp-rcj7
Apr 8, 2024

## Package

composer

shopware/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 6.3.5.0

## Patched versions

6.5.8.8,6.6.1.0

composer

shopware/platform
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

>= 6.3.5.0

6.5.8.8,6.6.1.0

## Description

### Impact

When a authentificated request is made to `POST /store-api/account/logout`, the cart will be cleared, but the User won't be logged out. This affects only the direct store-api usage, as the PHP Storefront listens additionally on `CustomerLogoutEvent` and invalidates the session additionally.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed with Shopware 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8.

### Workarounds

When you are not able to update, you can install the latest version of the Shopware Security Plugin.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
