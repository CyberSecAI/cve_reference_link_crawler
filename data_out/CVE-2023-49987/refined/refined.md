Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the "new_term" component of the School Fees Management System v1.0. Specifically, the "tname" parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system allows a user with sufficient privileges to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code via the "tname" parameter in the "new_term" form. This injected code is then executed within the browsers of other users when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge or consent.
    - Potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the School Fees Management System.
- **Specific Parameter:**  The vulnerability is located within the "tname" parameter of the "new_term" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account with necessary permissions to access the "new_term" functionality, usually an administrator role.
- The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and how to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerable version is School Fees Management System v1.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Geraldo Alc√¢ntara and confirmed on 19/12/2023.
- The steps to reproduce involves accessing "/ci_fms/admin/management/term", adding or editing a term, and inserting the XSS payload into the "tname" parameter.
