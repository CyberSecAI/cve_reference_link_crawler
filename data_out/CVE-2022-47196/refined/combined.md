# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1686

## Ghost Foundation Ghost Post Creation insecure default installation vulnerability

##### January 19, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-47197,CVE-2022-47195,CVE-2022-47194,CVE-2022-47196

##### SUMMARY

An insecure default vulnerability exists in the Post Creation functionality of Ghost Foundation Ghost 5.9.4. Default installations of Ghost allow non-administrator users to inject arbitrary Javascript in posts, which allow privilege escalation to administrator via XSS. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker can send an HTTP request to inject Javascript in a post to trick an administrator into visiting the post.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Ghost Foundation Ghost 5.9.4

##### PRODUCT URLS

Ghost - <http://www.ghost.org>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-453 - Insecure Default Variable Initialization

##### DETAILS

Ghost is a content management system with tools to build a website, publish content and send newsletters. Ghost offers paid subscriptions to members and supports a number of integrations with external services.

Ghost CMS separates users into four groups (five, if including the site owner) of increasing privilege: Contributor, Author, Editor and Administrator. Contributor users have the least privilege and are allowed to create but not publish posts. All users have the ability to include social media links, as well as a few other pieces of information that will be included on their posts and author pages. A stored XSS vulnerability exists in a number of these fields, and it can be leveraged from basic user attacks to full privilege escalation. As with any XSS, it does require a target user with the correct access level to access affected resources while logged in to trigger the injected Javascript. The vulnerabilities listed here can be triggered when a higher level user simply previews or visits any post by the malicious user, as these social links seems to be included in all of a user’s posts. We have confirmed that a full privilege escalation to administrator can be achieved with the correct Javascript payload.

Separating the admin domain as documented at <https://ghost.org/docs/config/#admin-url> will prevent this type of vulnerability from being exploited to perform privileged API calls, such as modifying a user group, adding users, etc. However, in default installations, these vulnerabilities can be used for privilege escalation via XSS. Essentially this means that, in default installations of Ghost CMS, users that can author pages and administrator users have the same privileges.

#### CVE-2022-47194 - Twitter
