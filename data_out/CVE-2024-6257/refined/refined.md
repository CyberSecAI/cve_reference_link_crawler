- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `go-getter` library, when performing Git operations, clones a repository to a specified destination, initializing a git config. If an update is required, the library pulls new changes. An attacker can modify the Git config after the cloning step, setting arbitrary configurations that can lead to code execution during the update process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation or sanitization of the git config after the initial clone. This allows the attacker to inject malicious configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by manipulating the Git configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can modify the Git config after the cloning step performed by go-getter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the Git config after the initial clone operation by `go-getter` but before a subsequent git update is performed.
