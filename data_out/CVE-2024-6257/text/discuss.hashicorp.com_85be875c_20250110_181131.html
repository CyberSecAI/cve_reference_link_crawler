**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2024-13

**Affected Products / Versions:** go-getter up to 1.7.4; fixed in go-getter 1.7.5.

**Publication Date:** June 24, 2024

**Summary**

HashiCorp’s go-getter library can be coerced into executing Git update on an existing maliciously modified Git Configuration, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-6257, was fixed in go-getter 1.7.5.

**Background**

HashiCorp’s [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) is a library for Go for downloading files or directories from various sources using a URL as the primary form of input.

**Details**

When go-getter is performing a Git operation, go-getter will try to clone the given repository in a specified destination. Cloning initializes a git config to the provided destination and if the repository needs to get updated go-getter will pull the new changes .

An attacker may alter the Git config after the cloning step to set an arbitrary Git configuration to achieve code execution.

**Remediation**

Consumers of the go-getter library should evaluate the risk associated with these issues in the context of their go-getter usage and upgrade go-getter to 1.7.5 or later. The latest go-getter releases can be found at <https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/releases>.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by Kraken Security Labs.
