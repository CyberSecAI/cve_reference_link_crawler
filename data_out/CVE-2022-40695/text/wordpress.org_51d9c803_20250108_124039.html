So where is the list that tells you the difference between the free and the paid? I usually like to see at a glance what this is with software offerings that have a free and paid version so I can make the quickest informed judgement as to how it will work for me. I see a zillion features and copy on the plugin page and sales page, LOL but nothing is telling me what the difference is? How can I make an informed decision without wasting my time experimenting with the plugin trying to find out if its going to suit my needs?

I am trying to reach customer service to get access to my account so that I can submit a support ticket; however, HostGator is rejecting emails to info AT clogica DOT com stating there is, “No Such User Here.”
My organization uses this plugin extensively, but we are unable to find the user login and password under which it was originally registered. We are working on re-developing the site and need the information. If you can please help, that would be greatly appreciated. I am unable to call the phone number since it is in Palestine, so e-mail is the preferred means of communication.
Thank you, kindly.
