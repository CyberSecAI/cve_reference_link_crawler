Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3621 (based on the content mentioning a submission regarding this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements. This occurs within the `/control/register_case.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation and sanitization when processing user input within the `register_case.php` file. Specifically, the code directly incorporates values from `$_POST` variables into the SQL `INSERT` statement.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code does not utilize prepared statements, which is a crucial mechanism to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data within the database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or potentially escalate privileges.
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to complete compromise of the database and the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `/control/register_case.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Form Fields:** The attacker manipulates the values of form fields (e.g., `title`, `case_no`, `client_name`, etc.) in the POST request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker must understand SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
- **Application Knowledge:** The attacker should know that the application is vulnerable, the vulnerable endpoint, and how to construct the POST request with injected SQL within the form fields.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `control/register_case.php` and involves the following lines:
 ```php
    $title = $_POST['title'];
    $case_no = $_POST['case_no'];
    $client_name = $_POST['client_name'];
    $court = $_POST['court'];
    $case_type = $_POST['case_type'];
    $case_stage= $_POST['case_stage'];
    $legel_acts = $_POST['legel_acts'];
    $description = $_POST['description'];
    $filling_date = $_POST['filling_date'];
    $hearing_date = $_POST['hearing_date'];
    $opposite_lawyer= $_POST['opposite_lawyer'];
    $total_fees= $_POST['total_fees'];
    $unpaid = $_POST['unpaid'];

    $case_sql = "INSERT INTO case_register(title,case_no,client_name,court,case_type,case_stage,legel_acts,description,filling_date,hearing_date,opposite_lawyer, total_fees,unpaid) VALUES('$title','$case_no','$client_name','$court','$case_type','$case_stage','$legel_acts','$description','$filling_date','$hearing_date','$opposite_lawyer','$total_fees','$unpaid')";
 ```
- The provided exploit example uses `sqlmap` to verify the vulnerability, demonstrating the potential to extract the current database user using SQL injection.
