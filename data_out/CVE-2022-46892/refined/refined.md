- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The operating system (OS) can overwrite the DSDT ACPI table to reinitialize the Root Complex, which is typically disabled during boot by the BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the ability of the OS to re-enable root ports after they've been disabled by the BIOS via DSDT ACPI table modification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Re-enabling root ports may provide unintended access depending on the platform configuration. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or compromise system integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to modify the DSDT ACPI table.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need local access to the system and the ability to modify OS configurations, specifically related to ACPI tables.
