Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the FooGallery WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied input in image attachment fields like 'Title', 'Alt Text', 'Custom URL', 'Custom Class', and 'Override Type' is not properly sanitized before being stored in the database. When this data is displayed on a web page, it is not properly escaped, allowing injected scripts to execute.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The plugin does not clean or validate user input for malicious content before storing it.
- Lack of output escaping: The plugin does not encode or escape data properly before displaying it on a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user views a page containing a FooGallery with the injected script, the script executes within their browser session.
- This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the page, and potentially further compromise of the website or user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the affected image attachment fields through the WordPress admin interface.
- Any user who accesses a page displaying a FooGallery that contains the malicious input will execute the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with at least author-level access to the WordPress site. This allows the attacker to modify image attachment fields via the WordPress admin interface.
