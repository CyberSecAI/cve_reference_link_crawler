# Doctor's Appointment System using PHP Free Source Code

Submitted by [hshnudr](/users/hshnudr "View user profile.") on Wednesday, June 8, 2022 - 10:13.
Language
[PHP](/language/php)

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/hshnudr/Screenshot%20%281%29.png?itok=Yp_6AHUX)](/sites/default/files/images/hshnudr/Screenshot%20%281%29.png)

(Updated)

This project helps a certain medical establishment such as a clinic or a hospital clients/patients to request an appointment with a doctor online. This project can also help doctors to manage the schedules of their appointments with their patients. This doctor's appointment system will organize the schedules of each patient's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the doctor they have selected. The system has 3 sides which are the administrator, the doctor, and the patient. The system admin will populate the list of the doctors with their specialties and along with the doctor's details and system credentials. The patients will browse the doctor's appointment system website to find a doctor that has the specialty of their needs. The patient can check the doctor's weekly schedule to help them to choose the day and time which they can comply for the appointment and they will submit their request for an appointment. After that, the doctors can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the patients for their availability.

## **Admin's Side**

Unfortunately no,
You must have to do it on sql database.
Go to phpmyadmin and select edoc
Then select admin table , add new record
Also you need to add same email to webuser table ( account type - a )

### [Appointment Limit](/comment/98342#comment-98342)

for example.. I created an appointment schedule and I set the limit of booking to 10 patients only. Even if the limit is only 10 patients, it surpasses the limit of booking like, I can still book even if its already full, it goes to 15 bookings. It doesnt appear some sort of, like (Invalid you cant book anymore) I hope you understand :)
