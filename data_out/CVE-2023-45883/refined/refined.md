Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-45883

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Qumu Multicast Extension v2 for Windows handles software repairs. When a standard user initiates a repair, a pop-up window is launched with SYSTEM privileges, which is an unintentional escalation of privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A standard user can trigger a process to run with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Insecure Software Repair Mechanism:** The repair process does not properly restrict the privileges of the launched pop-up window.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution as SYSTEM:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges (SYSTEM). This gives the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the attacker to be a standard user on the target machine.
- **User Initiated Repair:** The attacker needs to trigger a repair of the Qumu Multicast Extension v2 software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a standard user account on the Windows system where Qumu Multicast Extension v2 is installed.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the system and initiate the repair process.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable software is Qumu Multicast Extension v2 for Windows versions prior to 2.0.63.
- The vulnerability was discovered because a pop-up window with SYSTEM privileges is opened when a standard user triggers a software repair.
