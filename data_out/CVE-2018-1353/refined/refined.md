- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in FortiManager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A standard user with adom assignment can read the interface settings of vdoms unrelated to their adom. This means a user can access information they are not authorized to view.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to network configurations by viewing interface settings of different virtual domains.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user who has standard user privileges with an adom assignment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a standard user in FortiManager with an assigned adom.
