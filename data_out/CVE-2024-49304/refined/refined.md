- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pinpoint Booking System WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.9.9.5.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful CSRF attacks could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies based on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, performing actions on the vulnerable plugin without their consent or knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. No specific user privilege is mentioned for the attacker, only that the targeted user needs to have privileges within the vulnerable plugin.
