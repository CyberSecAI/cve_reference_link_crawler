- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of process-switched traffic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco IOS Software handles process-switched traffic on affected Catalyst 6000 series switches.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to an unexpected device reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can send crafted traffic to an affected device to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device and capable of sending crafted network traffic. No authentication is required. The attacker must also target a device with port security, device classifier, or AAA enabled.
