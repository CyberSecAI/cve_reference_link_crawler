This vulnerability is due to improper handling of process-switched traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-dos-Hq4d3tZG>  This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75056).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and have port security; device classifier; or authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) enabled:    + Catalyst 6500 Series Switches with Supervisor Engine 2T or 6T   + Catalyst 6800 Series Switches with Supervisor Engine 2T or 6T For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine Whether Port Security Is Enabled**  To determine whether a device is configured with port security, use the **show running-config | include interface|port-security** command. If port security is enabled on an interface, the device is affected by this vulnerability.  The following is an example of output from a device that has port security enabled:  ```   Router#show running-config | include interface|port-securityinterface GigabitEthernet1/2switchport port-security   ```  The following is an example of output from a device that does not have port security enabled:  ```   Router#show running-config | include interface|port-securityinterface GigabitEthernet1/1interface GigabitEthernet1/2   ```  **Determine Whether Device Classifier Is Enabled**  To determine whether a device is configured with device classifier, use the **show running-config | include device classifier** command. If the command returns output, the device is affected by this vulnerability.  The following is an example of output from a device that has device classifier enabled:  ```   Router#show running-config | include device classifierdevice classifier   ```  **Determine Whether AAA Is Enabled**  To determine whether a device is configured with AAA, use the **show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mab** command. If AAA is enabled on an interface, the device is affected by this vulnerability.  The following is an example of output from a device that has AAA enabled:  ```   Router#show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mabdot1x system-auth-controlinterface TenGigabitEthernet5/1authentication order mab dot1x   authentication priority mab dot1xauthentication port-control automabinterface TenGigabitEthernet5/2interface TenGigabitEthernet5/3   ```  The following is an example of output from a device that does not have AAA enabled:  ```   Router#show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mabinterface GigabitEthernet1/1interface GigabitEthernet1/2   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only the products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco IOS platforms:    + Catalyst 1000 Series Switches   + Catalyst 2000 Series Switches   + Catalyst 3000 Series Switches   + Catalyst 4000 Series Switches   + Catalyst 9000 Series Switches  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions.
