- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a broken access control issue, where a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is a **broken access control** vulnerability. This occurs due to a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to bypass intended access restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function and the higher-privileged actions an attacker can execute by exploiting the missing access control. However, the general impact is that an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable functions within the EventPrime plugin where access control checks are missing. A subscriber (low-privilege user) can execute functions intended for higher-privileged users by exploiting these missing checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A subscriber account is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need elevated privileges initially.
