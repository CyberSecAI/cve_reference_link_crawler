Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Argo CD handles error messages when accessing cluster information. Specifically, when a user attempts to access a cluster they don't have permission to view, the error message returned sometimes included details about whether the cluster exists or not. This allowed authenticated users to enumerate cluster names by inspecting these error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue that allows unauthorized enumeration of cluster names.
*   **Inconsistent Error Handling:** The API was not consistently returning the same generic "permission denied" error when a user lacked access to a specific cluster, thus revealing information about the existence of a requested cluster through the error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user can discover the names of clusters accessible to the Argo CD instance, even if they lack specific permissions to interact with those clusters. This includes the ability to enumerate project-scoped clusters.
*   This information could be used as part of a more complex attack, potentially targeting known clusters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the network through the Argo CD API endpoints, specifically the `/api/v1/clusters/*` endpoints.
*   Attackers can use `curl` or similar tools to send requests to the API with different cluster names and analyze the error responses to enumerate the valid cluster names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of Argo CD. No specific privileges are mentioned, but the user must have the ability to make API calls to the cluster endpoints.
*   The attacker does not need any special access beyond standard authenticated user capabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "Moderate" severity.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that a generic "permission denied" error message is returned regardless of whether the cluster exists or not, thus removing the information disclosure.
*   The fix was implemented by modifying the `getClusterAndVerifyAccess` function to consistently return `common.PermissionDeniedAPIError` if the user lacks the required permissions.
*   The provided diff shows the changes made to `server/cluster/cluster.go` and the addition of tests to ensure the fix in `server/cluster/cluster_test.go`.
*   The fix was released in Argo CD versions 2.11.3, 2.10.12, and 2.9.17.
