- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An open redirect vulnerability exists in the ICMS2 application when redirecting after modifying a user profile.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `back` parameter during the profile update process, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL. This is a classic open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website after they modify their profile. This could lead to credential phishing, where the attacker hosts a fake login page mimicking the real application. This allows them to steal the user's credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted URL containing a malicious redirect in the `back` parameter. For instance, `https://demo.instantcms.io/users/3/edit?back=//attacker.com`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit that URL and perform a profile update. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to craft the malicious URL. The vulnerability requires low privileges and user interaction (clicking "Save" after visiting the malicious URL).
