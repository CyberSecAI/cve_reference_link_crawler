- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled memory consumption during file downloads for scheduled jobs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The M-Files Server does not impose limits on memory allocation when users initiate file downloads through scheduled jobs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low privileged user can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by forcing the server to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and potentially crashing the service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out over the network by utilizing user controlled operations during file downloads for scheduled jobs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user is required to initiate the malicious file download operations.
