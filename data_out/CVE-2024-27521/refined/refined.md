- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TOTOLINK A3300R router has an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the "setOpModeCfg" function, triggered by multiple parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain complete control of the device by executing arbitrary system commands as root. This includes the ability to execute commands with administrative privileges. Remote exploitation is possible if the router's web interface is exposed on the WAN side.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the router's web interface, either locally or remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the router's web interface. This access can be obtained either locally or remotely. The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable function.
