The provided content is a GitHub pull request page. It contains information about a code change that fixes a minor build error, including a fix for a buffer overflow in the lexer.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The content indicates a "minor buffer overflow in the lexer" was fixed. While the exact nature of the overflow is not detailed, this suggests a vulnerability related to how the lexer processes input, potentially writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the lexer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content states it was a "minor" issue. Without details on its location in the lexer and how input is processed, it's hard to assess the exact impact. Generally, a buffer overflow can lead to crashes, denial-of-service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the specifics of the overflow and how it is exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve providing input to the lexer that exceeds the buffer size, triggering the overflow condition. The details depend on the specific location in the code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to influence the input processed by the vulnerable lexer. This might be through user-provided data, configuration files, network traffic, or other means of providing input.
