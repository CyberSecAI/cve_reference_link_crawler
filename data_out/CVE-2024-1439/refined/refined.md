  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Inadequate access control in Moodle LMS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-284: Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with a student role can create arbitrary events intended for users with higher roles. The attacker can also add events to the calendar of all users without their prior consent.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), specifically a student role, and no user interaction (UI:N) is required for exploitation. The scope of the attack is unchanged (S:U). The attacker can modify the calendar events (I:H).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a low privileged account (student role) on the Moodle LMS. The attacker does not require any user interaction to exploit this vulnerability."
