  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `prodType` parameter of the `prodList.php` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to leakage of sensitive user or system data, and compromise system security.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted payload in the `prodType` parameter of the `prodList.php` file. Specifically, an attacker can inject SQL code using the parameter `prodType`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in the `prodType` parameter to the vulnerable application."
