Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2023-52517**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition between the DMA RX transfer completion and the RX FIFO drain procedure in the `spi-sun6i` driver. When using DMA mode for SPI transfers, the transfer complete interrupt was firing as soon as the data was placed into the FIFO, while the DMA engine was still in the process of retrieving it. This caused the RX FIFO drain procedure and the DMA engine to race to read from the RX FIFO, which resulted in data corruption. Additionally, the RX buffer pointer was not updated according to DMA progress which led to the drain procedure being called in DMA mode, which is a bug.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Race condition when using DMA mode with the SPI interface.
- Incorrect handling of the RX FIFO drain when DMA is enabled.
- Lack of synchronization between interrupt handler and DMA engine when reading from RX FIFO.
- Incorrect RX buffer pointer handling in DMA mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data corruption during SPI RX transfers when DMA mode is used.
- Potential system instability or other undefined behavior due to corrupted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation would require a device utilizing the affected `spi-sun6i` driver.
- Specifically, the attack would need to involve using SPI in DMA mode with RX transfers.
- The attacker would need to trigger an SPI transfer to cause the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the SPI interface of the system.
- This might involve having access to the system, being able to control or send commands to the SPI device.
- The attacker could be a user, process, or malicious actor that is able to initiate SPI operations that use DMA.
