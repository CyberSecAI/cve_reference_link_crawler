# CIDR deny policies may not take effect when a more narrow CIDR allow is present

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-3wwx-63fv-pfq6
Oct 21, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

>= 1.15.0, < 1.15.10
>= 1.14.0, < 1.14.16

## Patched versions

1.15.10
1.14.16

## Description

### Impact

A policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than /32 may be ignored if there is

* A policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) **and**
* This narrower policy rule specifies either `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`

Note that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.

As an example, given the below policies, traffic is allowed to 1.1.1.2, when it should be denied:

```
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-scary-range
spec:
  endpointSelector: {}
  egressDeny:
  - toCIDRSet:
    - cidr: 1.0.0.0/8

---

apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: evade-deny
spec:
  endpointSelector: {}
  egress:
  - toCIDR:
    - 1.1.1.2/32
  - toEntities:
    - all

```
### Patches

This issue affects:

* Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.15 inclusive
* Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.9 inclusive

This issue has been patched in:

* Cilium v1.14.16
* Cilium v1.15.10

### Workarounds

Users with policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` can work around this issue by removing this configuration option and explicitly defining any allow rules required.

No workaround is available to users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities: all`.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@squeed](https://github.com/squeed), [@christarazi](https://github.com/christarazi), and [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme) for their work in triaging and resolving this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
