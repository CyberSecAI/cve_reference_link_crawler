The provided content relates to a race condition fix in the Linux kernel's AMD display driver, which is relevant to CVE-2024-46851.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists between `dc_state_destruct()` and `dcn10_set_drr()`.
- `dc_state_destruct()` nullifies the resource context of the DC state, which includes the pipe context used by `dcn10_set_drr()`.
- If `dc_state_destruct()` runs concurrently with IRQ processing that calls `dcn10_set_drr()`, `dcn10_set_drr()` might access already-nulled function callback fields of a `struct stream_resource`.
- Although `dcn10_set_drr()` checks if `tg` is NULL, a race can occur if the nullification happens immediately after the check but before the next access to `tg`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: Concurrent access and modification of shared resource (specifically the timing generator `tg` pointer).
- Use-after-free like scenario: Accessing memory after it has been freed (in this case nullified), potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, including kernel crashes, due to accessing freed/nullified memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent execution of `dc_state_destruct()` and `dcn10_set_drr()`.
- The `dcn10_set_drr()` function is called within IRQ handling. The `dc_state_destruct` is likely triggered by a user space action. The race occurs due to non-synchronized access to the resource context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trigger `dc_state_destruct()` while IRQ processing is simultaneously calling `dcn10_set_drr()`. This likely requires some understanding of the display driver and its interactions with user space.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix involves copying the `tg` pointer to a local variable before using it, which ensures that `dcn10_set_drr()` uses a valid pointer. This mitigates the race by reading the pointer before the dc_state_destruct call.
