Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `booster_extension_authorbox_shortcode_display` function within the Booster Extension plugin for WordPress. This function retrieves and displays author information, including sensitive data, without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of authorization checks within the `booster_extension_authorbox_shortcode_display` function. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the function and access sensitive data.
*   **Information Exposure:** The function retrieves various user details, including email addresses, display names, user URLs, descriptions, and social media links. This information is then displayed, potentially exposing it to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve user email addresses and other profile information. This can lead to privacy violations and facilitate further attacks (e.g., phishing or spam campaigns).
*  **Enumeration of User Data**: The ability to obtain user data such as names, descriptions, and social media profiles allows for the enumeration of user information on the target site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users. This means that an attacker doesn't need to have an account or log into the WordPress site to exploit it.
*   **Direct Function Call:** By sending a request that calls the vulnerable function, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The `$_POST['userid']` parameter, though not the primary vulnerability vector, provides an avenue for the attacker to choose the user whose information to expose.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Specific Position:** The attacker doesn't need to be logged in or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Ability:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code snippet shows the function that is vulnerable, specifically the retrieval of data using `get_the_author_meta` without checks on who is making the request.
*   The Wordfence article identifies the vulnerability as "Basic Information Exposure", which accurately reflects the nature of the issue.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.1 of the plugin.
