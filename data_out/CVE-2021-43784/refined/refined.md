{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the 16-bit length field of the netlink byte array attribute type.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A large enough malicious byte array attribute could cause the length field to overflow, leading to the attribute contents being misinterpreted as netlink messages for container configuration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially bypass container namespace restrictions by injecting a netlink payload that disables namespaces.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs some control over the container's configuration to inject a malicious byte array into the netlink message.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to influence container configuration, specifically the byte array attributes passed in the netlink messages. This can be through specifying custom namespace paths in `config.json` or by controlling mount paths after commit `9c44407`."
