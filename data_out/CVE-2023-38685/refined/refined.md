Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises because the noscript view in Discourse uses topic objects directly instead of using serialized objects. The serializer usually filters out hidden tags, but this filtering was missing in the noscript view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Restricted tags, which are meant to be hidden from unauthorized users, are exposed in the noscript view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** Unauthorized users can gain access to information about restricted tags, potentially revealing sensitive information about the topics.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges, implying that even regular users can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in Discourse versions `stable <= 3.0.5`, `beta <= 3.1.0.beta6`, and `tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta6`.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `noscript` view also filters out hidden tags when displaying topic information.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, with a base metric of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
