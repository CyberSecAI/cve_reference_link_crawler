Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the CVE-2023-46522 vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `deviceInfoRegister` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `deviceInfoRegister` function, which is likely related to device information registration. The specific protocol/method used for this function is not specified in the provided content but it can be inferred that it can be triggered remotely since the device is a router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the device that triggers the vulnerability. Given that the affected devices are routers, this could potentially be achieved remotely, assuming there is no firewall or other protections in place. However, specific details on the network accessibility are not provided.
- The attacker must craft the malicious input to overflow the stack buffer used by the deviceInfoRegister function in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- TP-LINK TL-WR886N V7.0_3.0.14_Build_221115_Rel.56908n.bin
- TP-LINK TL-WDR7660 2.0.30

**Additional notes:**
- There is a reference to a GitHub repository that includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) script named `CVE-2023-46522.py`, which confirms the exploitability of the vulnerability.
- A video file named `2024-10-17 21-21-26.mkv` is also available, which might show the vulnerability exploitation in action.
- The discovery of the same vulnerability on TL-WDR7660 device indicates a potential pattern in TP-LINK's firmware.
- The provided information gives more details than the CVE description, especially regarding specific vulnerable function and affected products and their versions.
