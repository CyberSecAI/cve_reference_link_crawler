- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user into opening a malicious PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PAR file to a user of the affected application. The user needs to open this file with the vulnerable application.
