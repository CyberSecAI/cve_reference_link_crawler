**CVE-2023-32845**

*   **Title:** Reachable assertion in 5G Modem
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Vulnerability Type:** DoS (Denial of Service)
*   **CWE:** CWE-617 Reachable Assertion
*   **Description:** In 5G Modem, there is a possible system crash due to improper error handling. This could lead to remote denial of service when receiving malformed RRC messages, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
*   **Affected Chipsets:** MT2735, MT2737, MT6297, MT6298, MT6813, MT6815, MT6833, MT6835, MT6853, MT6855, MT6873, MT6875, MT6875T, MT6877, MT6879, MT6880, MT6883, MT6885, MT6886, MT6889, MT6890, MT6891, MT6893, MT6895, MT6895T, MT6896, MT6897, MT6980, MT6980D, MT6983, MT6985, MT6989, MT6990
*   **Affected Software Versions:** Modem NR15, NR16, and NR17

**Summary of Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the 5G Modem component. Specifically, it involves a reachable assertion.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper error handling, leading to a system crash when malformed RRC (Radio Resource Control) messages are received. The improper handling of errors results in a reachable assertion that triggers a crash.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the system or device with the affected chipset becomes unusable, preventing it from performing its intended functions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, triggered by receiving malformed RRC messages. This could happen over the cellular network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send specifically crafted malformed RRC messages to the affected device. No special execution privileges or user interaction are needed. The attacker can achieve this by sending malformed RRC messages over the cellular network.
