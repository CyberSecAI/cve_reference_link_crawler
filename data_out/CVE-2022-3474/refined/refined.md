Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-3474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When using the `--experimental_remote_downloader` flag, Bazel delegates downloading external repositories to a remote server implementing the remote assets API.
- Bazel sends all user-provided credentials it knows about as qualifiers to the remote service, not just the credentials for the URLs it asks the remote service to download.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unnecessary Credential Exposure:** Bazel sends credentials for unrelated domains to the remote downloader, which is not needed and potentially risky.
- **Inefficient Caching:**  The qualifiers are used as part of the cache key remotely which also means the credentials, although unnecessary, are part of the cache key. This is inefficient and exposes the credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The remote downloader server, if compromised or malicious, could potentially gain access to credentials of unrelated domains that were used with bazel.
- This could expose sensitive information related to other services or assets which may be secured by those credentials, that were unnecessarily sent to the remote service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A compromised or malicious remote server implementing the remote assets API could potentially steal the exposed credentials.
- An attacker would need to control the remote server that Bazel uses as a remote downloader.
- The attacker needs to have the target user invoke bazel with the experimental remote downloader flag, and that user needs to have configured some credentials to download external repos.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of the remote downloader server configured for Bazel to use.
- The attacker does not need to be present in the same network, as long as the Bazel client uses a remote downloader that is controlled by them.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a test case link, `https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/downloader/GrpcRemoteDownloaderTest.java;l=345;drc=b750f8c0242d7fcb581d368d8b75e59c51c13a61`, which demonstrates the vulnerable behavior.
- The vulnerability affects Bazel versions prior to 4.2.3 (for 4.x), 5.3.2 (for 5.x).
- The patched versions are 4.2.3+ for 4.x, 5.3.2+ for 5.x, or any 6.x+ version.
- The recommended workaround is to only use a trusted remote downloader server and avoid giving Bazel unrelated credentials, however this does not fix the underlying issue, and is more of a guideline to minimize the risk.
