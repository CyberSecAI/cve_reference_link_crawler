# GrpcRemoteDownloader sends credentials of all domains to remote assets API

Moderate

[meteorcloudy](/meteorcloudy)
published
GHSA-mxr8-q875-rhwq
Oct 24, 2022

## Package

Bazel
(Bazel)

## Affected versions

> 3.1.0, < 4.2.3, < 5.3.2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

When using --experimental\_remote\_downloader, Bazel delegates downloading exteral

repositories to a remote server implementing the remote assets API. When doing

so, Bazel sends the user-provided credentials for the downloads as qualifier to

the remote service. It does send all credentials Bazel knows about, not just

credentials for the URLs it asks remote to download.

Sending any credentials to the remote server is already questonable and

inefficient (as the qualifier is used as part of the cache key remotely), but

Bazel should definitely not send credentials for unrelated domains.

Here's a test that demonstrates the behavior:

[https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/+/master:src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/downloader/GrpcRemoteDownloaderTest.java;l=345;drc=b750f8c0242d7fcb581d368d8b75e59c51c13a61](https://cs.opensource.google/bazel/bazel/%2B/master%3Asrc/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/remote/downloader/GrpcRemoteDownloaderTest.java;l=345;drc=b750f8c0242d7fcb581d368d8b75e59c51c13a61)

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Upgrade your Bazel version to at least 4.2.3 for 4.x, 5.3.2 for 5.x, or any 6.x+ version.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Only use a trusted remote downloader server and avoid giving Bazel unrelated credentials.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*
