- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer in the apusys component due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Local, no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed.
