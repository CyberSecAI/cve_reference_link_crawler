  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetFirewallCfg` function of the Tenda AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from a user-controlled input (`src`, derived from the `firewallEn` POST parameter) to a fixed-size buffer (`dest`) of 4 bytes, without proper bounds checking. This allows for a stack buffer overflow when the size of the user-supplied input exceeds the destination buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can cause a stack buffer overflow, leading to potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be implied that if the attacker overwrites the return address on the stack they could control execution flow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` endpoint with the `firewallEn` parameter containing an oversized string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device on the network. No authentication is explicitly stated as being needed, but it can be inferred that some level of network access is required"
