Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2974

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `load_more` function within the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the `post_status` parameter in the `args` array passed to the `wp_parse_str` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information. By manipulating the `args` parameter, specifically related to the query for loading more posts via Ajax, an unauthenticated attacker can bypass access controls.
*   **Lack of Authorization/Authentication:** The vulnerability is present because the plugin does not properly check user permissions before querying posts based on the provided arguments.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can directly manipulate the 'args' parameter, to specify that they would like to see all posts, including draft and private posts which should otherwise be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of Private and Draft Posts:**  An unauthenticated attacker can potentially retrieve private and draft posts that should not be publicly accessible.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, upcoming content, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through unauthenticated HTTP requests to the vulnerable `load_more` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No authentication required:** An attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs only network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin/function:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and the function that handles the ajax request which leads to the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 5.9.13 of the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 5.9.14.
* The fix includes explicitly setting the 'post_status' to 'publish' before running the query when it is provided as input, which prevents the user from being able to see anything but published posts.
