Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `new_prescription.php` file of the Clinic's Patient Management System. Specifically, the `patient` parameter from the POST request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code through the `patient` parameter, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive information from the database, including patient records, user credentials, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request sent to the `new_prescription.php` file.
- **`patient` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is inserted into the `patient` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `patient` parameter in `new_prescription.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable file: `/pms/new_prescription.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `patient`
- The provided POC demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `patient` parameter in a POST request.
