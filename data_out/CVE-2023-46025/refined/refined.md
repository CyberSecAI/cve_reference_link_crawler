- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation and sanitization on the `editid` parameter in the `teacher-info.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `editid` parameter in a crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `editid`. The PoC provided suggests the attacker also needs to be logged in as an admin user and navigate to the "Edit Details" page.
