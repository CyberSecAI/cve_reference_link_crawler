Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in insufficient checks when invoking public methods on `Command` classes in the `turbo_boost-commands` Ruby gem. Although the library verifies that the method exists as a public method, it doesn't strictly enforce which methods are safe, allowing for the invocation of more methods than intended, depending on the application's authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Method Validation:** The library checks for the existence of a public method but does not validate against a list of safe methods.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Method Invocation:** Attackers can potentially invoke unintended public methods, which can have security implications depending on the application and the methods exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Security Risks:** The ability to invoke unintended methods could lead to various security breaches, including unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions, depending on the application's implementation.
- **Application-Specific Vulnerabilities:** The precise impact depends on the specific methods and their functionalities within a given application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Method Invocation:** An attacker can craft malicious requests specifying the method to be invoked on a command class.
- **Exploitation of Input:** Attackers leverage the application's input parameters that define the method name.
- **Bypass Intended Authorization:** If authorization is not configured strictly, it may be possible to invoke more methods than should be allowed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending requests that specify the desired command and method to be executed.
- **Understanding of Application Logic:** A deeper understanding of the application's inner workings and authorization checks can facilitate the exploitation of this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:**  <=0.1.2 and <= 0.2.1 of the `turbo_boost-commands` gem.
- **Patched Versions:** 0.1.3 and 0.2.2 of the `turbo_boost-commands` gem.
- **Workaround:** A workaround is provided that adds a `before_command` guard in the application's command class to validate the method names before invocation.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as High.
