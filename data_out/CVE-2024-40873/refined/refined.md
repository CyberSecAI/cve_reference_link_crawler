- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Secure Access administrative console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  XSS vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the administrative console.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with system administrator permissions can interfere with other system administrators' use of the publishing UI when the administrators are editing the same management object. There is no loss of confidentiality, impact to system availability is none, impact to system integrity is high.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with system administrator permissions exploits the vulnerability through the publishing UI. This requires another admin to be editing the same object concurrently.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs system administrator permissions to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must also be editing the same object as another administrator for the exploit to work.
