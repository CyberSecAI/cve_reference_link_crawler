There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Secure
Access administrative console of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.07.
Attackers with system administrator permissions can interfere with another
system administratorâ€™s use of the publishing UI when the administrators are
editing the same management object. The scope is unchanged, there is no loss of
confidentiality. Impact to system availability is none, impact to system
integrity is high.
