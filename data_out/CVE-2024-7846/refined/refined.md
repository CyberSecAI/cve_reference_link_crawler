- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied block attributes within the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor+ privileges can inject arbitrary scripts, potentially leading to malicious actions on the website such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, or performing unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious payload within a block's attributes when using the WordPress post editor. Specifically, an attacker can insert a crafted HTML snippet using a "wp:yith/poc" block containing a malicious 'onmousemove' attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have Contributor+ level access on the WordPress site. The attacker also needs to be able to create or edit posts using the code editor.
