Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-48253:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the application's use of raw SQL queries without proper input sanitization, specifically within the `delete_oqrs_line()` function. This function directly concatenates user-supplied data (`id`) into the SQL query, which is then executed against the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.  The application fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a database query. Although the `xss_clean()` function is used, it's designed to prevent XSS, not SQL injection.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The controller function `delete_oqrs_line()` does not perform any authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including data exfiltration, data modification, or data deletion, depending on the database permissions and the attackers goals. The specific impact detailed here is deletion of records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `delete_oqrs_line` function/endpoint with a crafted `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it accessible to any attacker with network access to the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's web server.
