Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs in the "password" and "password again" fields within the "My Preferences - Add user" section of CMSmadesimple v2.2.18.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie stealing
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Script Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious script, specifically using the `<svg/onload=alert()>` tag within the password and password again fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the CMSmadesimple application. They would need to be logged into the admin panel.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know where the vulnerable input fields are located ("My Preferences - Add User")

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `install/adduser.php` within CMSmadesimple v2.2.18.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the injection of the following payloads:
  -  `'"><svg/onload=alert('password')>` into the password field.
  -  `'"><svg/onload=alert('password again')>` into the password again field.
- These payloads, when submitted, result in the execution of the `alert()` function, confirming the ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

The attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code via a crafted script in the "password" and "password again" fields of the "My Preferences - Add User" section of the CMS.
