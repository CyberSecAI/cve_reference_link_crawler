Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Elastic APM .NET Agent fails to sanitize sensitive HTTP header information before logging it during an application error. Normally, the agent sanitizes headers before sending to the APM server, but this sanitization is skipped during application errors, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive HTTP header information is leaked.
- Lack of proper sanitization during error conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive data contained in HTTP headers, which could include authentication tokens, session IDs, or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering an application error that causes the APM agent to log the unsanitized HTTP headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause an error within the monitored application that uses the vulnerable Elastic APM .NET Agent.
- The attacker might need to have knowledge of the application's behavior to cause a specific error that triggers the vulnerability.
-  The CVSS score indicates a high level of privilege (PR:H) is required, implying an attacker with significant access to the application environment is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided CVSSv3 score is `2.1: AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Elastic APM .NET Agent before 1.10.0.
*   The suggested solution is to upgrade to version 1.10.0.
