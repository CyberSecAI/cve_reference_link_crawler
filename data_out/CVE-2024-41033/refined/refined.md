The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41033.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cachestat()` function in the Linux kernel was flushing statistics, which could cause a sleep, within an RCU (Read-Copy-Update) read section. This was happening during the `workingset_test_recent()` step, which checks if a folio's eviction is recent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect RCU usage:** Performing a potentially sleeping operation (flushing stats) inside an RCU read section violates the constraints of RCU, which is designed for non-blocking, read-mostly operations. This could lead to system instability, deadlocks, or performance degradation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System instability: Violating RCU rules can lead to unpredictable behavior and system crashes.
- Potential deadlocks: If the stats flushing operation blocks, it could cause a deadlock with other RCU readers.
- Performance degradation: Sleeping inside RCU read sections can block other processes or threads waiting to use the RCU mechanism, negatively impacting system performance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by invoking `cachestat()`, which is a memory management operation that is used to collect statistics on the memory usage. This can be invoked by a privileged process.
- The specific condition is triggered when checking if a folio's eviction is recent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `cachestat()` function, which typically requires privileged access.

**Additional Notes:**

The patch moves the stats flushing operation to outside the RCU read section and adds a boolean parameter to `workingset_test_recent()` to skip flushing stats during the recency check. This resolves the issue by adhering to RCU rules and ensuring that no potentially blocking operations happen within RCU read sections.
