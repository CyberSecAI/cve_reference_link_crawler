### Summary:
The provided content describes CVE-2024-3495, an unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability in the "Country State City Dropdown CF7" WordPress plugin, versions 2.7.2 and earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied parameters (`cnt` and `sid`) in the `tc_csca_get_states` and `tc_csca_get_cities` functions within the `ajax-actions.php` file. These functions handle AJAX requests to retrieve states and cities based on a selected country or state. The plugin uses `$wpdb->prepare` incorrectly which leads to the parameters being interpreted as string literals instead of placeholders, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user inputs are directly used in SQL queries, enabling attackers to manipulate the queries.
*   **Lack of proper parameterization:** The use of single quotes within `$wpdb->prepare` to denote placeholders instead of `%s` for strings.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerable AJAX actions are accessible without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete system compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to full control of the database server and potentially the webserver.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the `wp_ajax_tc_csca_get_states` and `wp_ajax_tc_csca_get_cities` actions with malicious SQL code in the `cnt` or `sid` POST parameters.
*   The vulnerable endpoints are publicly accessible, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.7.3 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/ajax-actions.php` file, specifically within the `tc_csca_get_states` and `tc_csca_get_cities` functions.
*   The plugin uses `$wpdb->prepare` function, but uses it incorrectly. Instead of using %s placeholders, it uses '%1s', treating the entire input as a string literal.
*   The provided code snippets show the fix by replacing the `%1s` with `%s` and adding a check for manage_options capability, preventing non-administrators from using the vulnerable functions.
