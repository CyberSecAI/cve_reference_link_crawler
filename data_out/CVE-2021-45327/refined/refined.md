Based on the provided content, it appears that CVE-2021-45327 is related to the change of GET requests to POST requests in Gitea. Specifically, the provided content shows three different pull requests: #10462, #10465 and #10582, where GET requests were changed to POST requests in different parts of the application, including admin dashboards and logout functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
The root cause seems to be the use of GET requests for actions that should ideally use POST requests. This is a common vulnerability that can expose the application to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Using GET requests for state-changing actions (like admin changes or logout) makes the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker could potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the Gitea instance via crafted links or embedded images in malicious websites.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection**: The original implementation lacked proper CSRF protection mechanisms for these actions, thus requiring the change to POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation**:
*   **Unauthorized actions:** An attacker could potentially make unauthorized changes to the Gitea instance if they trick an administrator to click on a malicious link. For example, the attacker could change admin settings or make other unauthorized changes through crafted requests.
*   **User Logout:**  An attacker could log a user out by crafting a malicious link if they trick a user to click on it.

**Attack Vectors**:
*   **Malicious links:** Attackers could send phishing emails with malicious links designed to trigger the vulnerable actions.
*   **Embedded Images/Iframes:**  Attackers could embed malicious links within images or iframes on attacker-controlled websites, which when loaded by a user could trigger state-changing GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a page with malicious content.
*   **No direct access to the Gitea server is required.** The attacker does not need to authenticate on the Gitea instance as the attack leverages the authenticated session of the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Pull request #10462 addresses changing GET requests to POST in general for several actions.
*   Pull request #10465 specifically addresses changes in admin dashboards to use POST.
*   Pull request #10582 specifically addresses the logout functionality to use POST.
*   The pull requests are labelled as "type/bug" and "topic/security", indicating that the issue is considered a bug and has security implications.
*   The commits associated with these pull requests included adding forms and changing links to forms with POST actions to prevent CSRF attacks.
*  The pull requests have been backported, indicating the bug affects multiple versions of the software.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from the use of GET requests for actions that should have used POST requests, making the application susceptible to CSRF attacks. The pull requests addressed this by converting these actions to use POST requests and implementing proper CSRF protection.
