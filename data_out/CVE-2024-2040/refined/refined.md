- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Himer theme lacks CSRF checks in certain areas, specifically when joining private groups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into joining a private group without their consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor crafts an HTML page with a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, sends a request to the vulnerable website to join a group.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting the crafted form. No specific privileges on the target system are needed, only a logged-in user.
