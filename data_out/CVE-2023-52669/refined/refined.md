```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When processing the last block in CTR mode, the s390 AES code would always read a full block, potentially overreading the buffer if the remaining data was less than a full block.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overread",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential information leak due to reading beyond the bounds of the input buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing data using AES in CTR mode on s390 architecture where the last block is not a full block size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply input data to the vulnerable AES-CTR implementation on a s390 system."
