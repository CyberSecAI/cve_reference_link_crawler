In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: s390/aes - Fix buffer overread in CTR mode

When processing the last block, the s390 ctr code will always read
a whole block, even if there isn't a whole block of data left.  Fix
this by using the actual length left and copy it into a buffer first
for processing.
