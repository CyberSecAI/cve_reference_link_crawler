- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The dashboard title in IsarFlow software versions 5.23 and earlier was not properly encoded in all places, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper encoding of the dashboard title.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the dashboard title. This code is executed when the "delete dashboard" dialog is opened or when an admin views user generated dashboards. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, session hijacking, or other malicious activities, especially when targeting higher privileged user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the application can inject malicious JavaScript code into the dashboard title. The code is then executed when the dashboard title is displayed in certain contexts, such as the "delete dashboard" dialog or the "User dashboard" view.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the IsarFlow application to inject the malicious code.
