| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c0)  msiddiqu    2021-11-23 09:16:03 UTC  ``` A Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability (from any user to root) was found in polkit's pkexec, a SUID-root program that is installed by default on every major Linux distribution.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c5)  lnacshon    2021-11-24 09:15:56 UTC  ``` OSD clusters are affected with low severity, just because some clusters are making use of packages which have dependencies on polkit (e.g. timedatex). Also as affecting by OCP, polkit package was shipped in OCP 4.7 only.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c11)  Marco Benatto    2022-01-20 15:58:48 UTC  ``` There's an issue on pkexec where it doesn’t validate the argument count, assuming it will always be at least 1 and that the second value is either NULL or the command to be executed by pkexec as a privileged user. If an attacker successfully forces the argument array to be empty, this means pkexec will interpret content from the environment array as the application to be executed. An attacker can leverage this by manipulating these variables to contain specific values and payloads, allowing it to be executed as a privileged user without any authentication to be requested.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c12)  Marco Benatto    2022-01-25 17:23:21 UTC  ``` Created polkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2045563](show_bug.cgi?id=2045563 "CLOSED ERRATA -

In OSD, the graphical usage is not relevant; in CLI usage, the user will use the OC command to authenticate to the OSD cluster. Also, OSD does not make any special use of polkit in production clusters. In OSD, on one of the test OSD cluster's master, timedatex has a dependency on polkit. Therefore, for OSD/ARO, the impact is Low.   Your OSD clusters are in the production group and therefore do not make any special use of polkit.   If you have any additional questions, please let me know.   ``` |  |
