WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict system access to authorized personnel and follow a least privilege approach

• Temporary mitigation exists at the expense of pkexec’s capabilities. By removing SUID permissions,
the program cannot run processes as root. However, any processes that rely on it for normal
operation will be affected

- SUID permission can be removed with chmod, as follows: chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

A combination of hardware and software, Siemens’ SINUMERIK Edge provides a machine-oriented
platform for apps that facilitate digital production support and optimization.

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-4034

A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit’s pkexec utility. The pkexec application is
a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according
predeﬁned policies. The current version of pkexec doesn’t handle the calling parameters count
correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage
this by crafting environment variables in such a way it’ll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code.
When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users
administrative rights on the target machine.
