Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `pkexec` program, part of the polkit package.  The root cause is an improper handling of command-line arguments passed to `pkexec`. Specifically, `pkexec` does not validate the number of arguments (argc). This allows an attacker to manipulate the process's environment variables in such a way that `pkexec` interprets them as a command to be executed. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access during argument processing, and ultimately, the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Argument Validation:** `pkexec` fails to properly validate the number of arguments, causing an out-of-bounds read from the `argv` array.
*   **Environment Variable Injection:** The lack of proper argument handling allows attackers to inject and control environment variables, which will be used as commands.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an unprivileged local user to execute commands as a privileged user, granting them full root access.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The root cause ultimately stems from memory corruption due to the incorrect handling of the argument vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged attacker can gain root-level privileges on the affected system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges by manipulating the process's environment.
*   **Complete System Control:** Gaining root access can enable the attacker to completely control the affected system, including reading or modifying data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local login access to the target system.
*   **Command Line Arguments:** The exploit is triggered by calling `pkexec` with no command line arguments.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Setting specific environment variables to exploit the out-of-bounds memory access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a regular, unprivileged local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:** The attacker needs to execute commands on the target system (e.g., via SSH or console).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability has been present since the initial creation of `pkexec` in 2009.
*   The vulnerability is easily exploitable and does not require a high level of technical skill.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when `pkexec` is called with no command line arguments.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited even when the polkit daemon is not running.
*   Exploitation often involves crafting a malicious payload as an environment variable.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by either removing the SUID bit from `pkexec` temporarily (though this is not advised by Red Hat because it will break system functionality) or applying the vendor-provided patches.
