Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-30207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded symmetric cryptographic key to protect communication between the client and server in the affected systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The core vulnerability is the presence of a hard-coded key used for encryption, which is a well-known and easily exploitable weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** An attacker knowing the hard-coded key can decrypt the communication between the client and server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** An attacker can modify encrypted messages in transit and re-encrypt with the hardcoded key, potentially corrupting or manipulating data.
*   **Compromised Availability:** By compromising confidentiality and integrity, an attacker could also disrupt availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept communication between a client and a server on the network.
*   **Key Knowledge:** The attacker must gain knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to attempt exploitation if they know the hardcoded key and can intercept network traffic.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the affected client and server.
*   **Key Discovery:** The attacker must obtain the hardcoded key.

**Mitigation:**
*   Protect communication using a secure channel such as VPN. Ensure that server ports are reachable via VPN only.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is to protect all communication between RTLS Clients and the Server using a secure channel like a VPN and to ensure that the configured Server ports are exclusively reachable via the VPN.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as critical, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0, and CVSS v4.0 base score of 10.0
