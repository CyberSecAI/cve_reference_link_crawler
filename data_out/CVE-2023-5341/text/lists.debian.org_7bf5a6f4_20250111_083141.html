Package        : imagemagick
Version        : 8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-1289 CVE-2023-5341 CVE-2023-34151

Imagemagick a graphical software suite for displaying, creating and
modifying images was vulnerable.

CVE-2023-1289

    A vulnerability was discovered
    in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file
    loads itself and causes a segmentation fault.
    This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a
    specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation
    fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp," resulting in
    a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates
    a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the
    SVG file contains many render actions.

CVE-2023-5341

    A heap use-after-free flaw was found in coders/bmp.c

CVE-2023-34151

    A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick,
    due to undefined behaviors of casting double to size_t in
    svg, mvg and other coders

Moreover a few potential security problems were fixed in the
TIFF coders like for instance memory leaks. These issues were
unfortunatly CVE less. CVE-2023-39978 (a deny of service)
was also fixed by being introduced by partial fixes
of these problems.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
