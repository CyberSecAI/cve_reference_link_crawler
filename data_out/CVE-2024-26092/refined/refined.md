The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2024-26092:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE Number:** CVE-2024-26092
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*  **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the presence of a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, which is then stored and later rendered on the webpage, allowing malicious JavaScript to execute in the context of the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized input, which is then rendered without proper encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) on the system.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious content (UI:R).

**Summary**
CVE-2024-26092 is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager that allows an attacker with low privileges to achieve arbitrary code execution by injecting malicious code that will be executed when a user interacts with the compromised content.
