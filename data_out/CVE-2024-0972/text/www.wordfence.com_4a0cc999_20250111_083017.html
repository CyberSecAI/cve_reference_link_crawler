### Description

The BuddyPress Members Only plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.9 via the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's "All Other Sections On Your Site Will be Opened to Guest" feature (when unset) and view restricted page and post content.
