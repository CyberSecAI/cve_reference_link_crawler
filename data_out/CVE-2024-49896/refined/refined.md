Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `dc_is_stream_unchanged` function in the AMD display driver does not check for null pointers before dereferencing the `old_stream` and `stream` variables, which can be passed as NULL by `amdgpu_dm`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The code directly accesses members of the `old_stream` and `stream` structures without verifying if they are valid pointers. This can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior if either is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A null pointer dereference would cause the kernel to crash, leading to a system-wide denial of service.
- **Possible privilege escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, a carefully crafted exploit leading to a kernel crash could potentially be used for other exploits (less likely, but a risk).

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or faulty application using `amdgpu_dm` to configure the display could intentionally pass NULL stream pointers to the vulnerable function to trigger the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the `amdgpu_dm` display driver API and configure display streams. This usually requires some level of privilege on the system (e.g., running as a user with video or graphics permissions, or system-level control).

**Additional details:**
The fix introduces a check for NULL pointers before accessing the stream structures, preventing the null pointer dereference. The issue was identified by Coverity static analysis as a FORWARD_NULL issue.
