In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check stream before comparing them

[WHAT & HOW]
amdgpu_dm can pass a null stream to dc_is_stream_unchanged. It is
necessary to check for null before dereferencing them.

This fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.
