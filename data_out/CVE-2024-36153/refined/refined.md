*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user
*  **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N), a low attack complexity (AC:L), requiring a low privilege user(PR:L), user interaction (UI:R), scope change (S:C)
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low privileges can inject malicious script into the application which is then executed when a user interacts with the affected component.
