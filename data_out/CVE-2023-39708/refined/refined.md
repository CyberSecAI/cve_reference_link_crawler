  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2023-39708",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It doesn't properly sanitize user input, specifically within the 'New buy section', allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected and executed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
         "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites. They could also alter the page content or deface the application, causing reputational damage.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious XSS payload within the input fields of the 'New buy section'.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable page of the application and fill in the input forms. No authentication is explicitly required, based on the provided steps.  It appears to be a local attack vector, as implied by the use of 'localhost' in the steps."
