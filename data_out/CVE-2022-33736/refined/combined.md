PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Opcenter Quality is a quality management system (QMS) that enables organizations to safeguard
compliance, optimize quality, reduce defect and rework costs and achieve operational excellence by
increasing process stability. The integrated process capabilities (control charts, statistics, quality gates)
can detect production errors to avoid further processing and shipment of nonconforming material.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-33736

The affected applications do not properly validate login information during authentication. This could
lead to denial of service condition for existing users or allow unauthenticated remote attackers to
successfully login without credentials.
