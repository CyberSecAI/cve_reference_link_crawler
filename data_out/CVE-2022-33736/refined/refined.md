- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected applications do not properly validate login information during authentication. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to rich client modules using the `IbsGailWrapper`-interface. After issuing a record, the authentication bypass vulnerability can occur on all modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication leading to an authentication bypass. Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm (CWE-303)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthenticated access to the application, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.
    - Denial of service condition for existing users.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by the use of the  `IbsGailWrapper`-interface and can be exploited remotely. The CVSS vector indicates an attack vector of "Adjacent" (AV:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected system on the network to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction (UI:N) is required. The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) to trigger the vulnerability.
