Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6967 (Note: The CVE description is a placeholder, so this analysis is based on the provided content.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability in the `Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System v1.0`.
- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Direct SQL Query Construction: The application uses a direct concatenation or similar method to build SQL queries, making it vulnerable to injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Data Exposure: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access and extract sensitive information from the server's database. This may include user credentials, personal details, or other confidential data related to employees and visitors.
- Potential Data Manipulation: It may also be possible to modify or delete data, depending on the database user privileges used by the application.
- Potential for Further Attacks: Depending on the access and permissions granted to the vulnerable application, exploitation could lead to lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation: The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter in a GET or POST request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/employee_gatepass/admin/?page=employee/manage_employee`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `id` parameter used in the SQL query construction.
- Understanding of SQL Injection: The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to construct malicious queries.
