- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability exists in the `fazsvcd` daemon of FortiAnalyzer. The vulnerability is due to the use of externally controlled format string, which allows a crafted request to be processed as a format string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a format string bug [CWE-134]. This occurs when a program takes user-supplied data and uses it directly in a formatting string without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, privileged attacker with an admin profile can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or commands on the affected system. This can lead to privilege escalation and full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted request to the vulnerable `fazsvcd` daemon. The attacker must be remote and have administrative privileges to exploit this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be remote, have an admin profile and be able to send requests to the vulnerable service.
