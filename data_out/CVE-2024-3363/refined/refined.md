Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin/borrowed/index.php` file of the SourceCodester Online Library System version 1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize or neutralize user-supplied input within the `BookPublisher` and `BookTitle` parameters before incorporating them into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the vulnerable parameters. This could allow attackers to bypass security checks, potentially giving access to or modifying any data within the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the database. Attackers can:
    - **Confidentiality:** Access sensitive information such as customer data, personal data, and trade secrets.
    - **Integrity:** Modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
    - **Availability:** Cause denial of service by modifying the database schema or deleting critical data, effectively taking the application offline.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access to the server.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `admin/borrowed/index.php` page.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `BookPublisher` and `BookTitle` parameters with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication to the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Some knowledge of SQL is required to craft a suitable payload for the SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**
- **Exploit Availability:** A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available on GitHub.
- **Exploitation Tools:** Tools such as sqlmap can be used to automate the exploitation process.
- **Google Hacking:** Vulnerable targets can be found using Google Dorking techniques (e.g. `inurl:admin/borrowed/index.php`).
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** The attack technique is mapped to T1505 in MITRE ATT&CK.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a critical severity.
- **Affected Parameters**: The `Author`, `BookPublisher` and `BookTitle` parameters are all vulnerable to SQL Injection.
