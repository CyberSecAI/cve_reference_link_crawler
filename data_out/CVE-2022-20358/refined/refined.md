Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which processes can connect to sync adapters. Specifically, the code did not properly enforce that only the system server should be allowed to establish these connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on sync adapter connections, allowing potentially malicious or untrusted applications to connect to sync adapters.
*   **Missing System Server Check:**  The code failed to verify if the connecting process was indeed the system server before granting access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** As categorized in the Android Security Bulletin, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure. This could involve a malicious app gaining unauthorized access to data handled by sync adapters, potentially exposing sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability to connect to sync adapters, even if it should not have access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application running on the target device to exploit this vulnerability. No additional execution privileges are needed.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates the fix implemented: "Only allow the system server to connect to sync adapters".
- This implies the vulnerability allowed other processes besides the system server to connect to sync adapters, which the fix now prevents through "changing the check logic".
- The change was backported to older versions of Android, indicated by the `cherry picked from commit` information.

**Summary**
CVE-2022-20358 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Android framework related to sync adapter access control. A malicious application could exploit this weakness to connect to sync adapters and potentially gain access to sensitive information. The fix restricts connections to only the system server.
