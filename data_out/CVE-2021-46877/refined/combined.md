\* 2.12.6: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.12.6>

\* 2.13.1: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.13.1>

were just released. In addition to the usual "it is good to use the

latest patch", there is one additional reason for upgrade -- there is

a fix to one CVE-related bug:

 <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3328>

which:

1. Is ALMOST 100% NOT AFFECTING YOU IN ANY WAY wrt security, BUT

2. All the "security scanning" tools will quickly start reporting this

as a world-ending catastrophe to be avoided (and thankfully they found

it)

The issue itself fixed is explained in that Github issue and ONLY

affects you if:

1. You (or one of deps) uses \_JDK serialization\_ for

serialization/deserialization Jackson types (some caching frameworks

might)

2. Value being serialized/deserialized is of type `JsonNode`

3. Jackson version used is 2.10.0 - 2.13.0 (but not 2.12.6, 2.13.1)

4. Attacker is able to replace binary serialization of JsonNode (or

provide one) to your code, and craft a "poison pill" payload

If you happen to have all of the above, the consequence is that the

attacker can induce up to 2 gig transient heap usage per read.

And just to make sure: there is absolutely no issue when using

`JsonNode` in normal ways; reading/writing JSON (and other formats)

using `ObjectMapper`.

This ONLY AFFECTS JDK serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream).

Happy Holidays,
