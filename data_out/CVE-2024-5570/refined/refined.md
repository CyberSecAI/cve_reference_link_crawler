- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization checks when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically the ability for any authenticated user (even a subscriber) to update plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with subscriber-level access can modify the plugin's settings, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or other security issues.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/options-general.php` with modified plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least a subscriber) on the WordPress site.
