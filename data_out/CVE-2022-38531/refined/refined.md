Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The web management interface of the FPT router (specifically models G-97RG6M and G-97RG3) contains ping and traceroute tools. The input field for the target IP address or URL is vulnerable to command injection.
*   The backend program fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input, directly concatenating the input with a system command, and subsequently executes the unsanitized string as a shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization. Attackers can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `url_or_ip` field.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the user-supplied input before using it in a system command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This could lead to complete control of the device, including the ability to modify settings, access network traffic, or use the router for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible via the web management interface of the router.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers need to intercept the HTTP request sent when using the ping or traceroute function and modify the `url_or_ip` parameter to include malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web management interface.
*   **Authentication:** While authentication is required to access the vulnerable functions, the router is susceptible to password brute-forcing attacks due to the ability to change the login password. This reduces the practical difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Interception:** Attackers would likely use tools such as BurpSuite to intercept and manipulate the HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
