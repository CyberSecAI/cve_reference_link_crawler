|  | # Google Dork: N/A |
|  | # Date: 07/09/2024 |
|  | # Exploit Author: Andrew Lemon/Red Threat https://redthreatsec.com |
|  | # Vendor Homepage: https://www.q-free.com |
|  | # Software Link: N/A |
|  | # Version: 1.9.x |
|  | # Tested on: (Intelight x-1) Linux 3.14.57 |
|  | # CVE : CVE-2024-38944 |
|  | ## Vulnerability Description |
|  | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of MaxTime Database Editor. |
|  | Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. |
|  |  |
|  | The specific flaw exists within the web-based UI on Traffic Controllers running version 1.9.x firmware. |
|  | The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. |
|  | An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain full control of Intelight Traffic Controllers and modify the configuration of a traffic intersection, |
|  | modify traffic light sequences, or trigger the intersection to go into 4 way flash causing a denial of service and causing traffic congestion. |
|  | ## Steps to Reproduce |
|  |  |
|  | Navigate to the IP address of an identified controller |
|  | When prompted for authentication append /cgi-bin/generateForm.cgi?formID=142 to the end of the IP address |
|  | Under the web security tab change the drop down from enabled to disabled and select apply or take note of the username and password and login with those. |
