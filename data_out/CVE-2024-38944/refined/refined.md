```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full control of Intelight Traffic Controllers and modify the configuration of a traffic intersection, modify traffic light sequences, or trigger the intersection to go into 4 way flash causing a denial of service and causing traffic congestion.",
  "Attack vectors": "By navigating to the IP address of an identified controller and appending /cgi-bin/generateForm.cgi?formID=142 to the end of the IP address, the attacker can bypass authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the IP address of the vulnerable traffic controller. No prior authentication is needed."
