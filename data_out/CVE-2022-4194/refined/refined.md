- The "Exploitable" field in the Gentoo Security Advisory indicates a "remote" attack vector, implying this can be triggered by a malicious website or other remote content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability in the accessibility component. This could be achieved by crafting malicious HTML or JavaScript that interacts with the accessibility features in a way that causes the UAF.
- The attacker could be in a remote position, serving the malicious content to a victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher.
