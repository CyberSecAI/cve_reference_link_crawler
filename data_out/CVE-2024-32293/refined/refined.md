- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromDhcpListClient` function of the Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633) firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `page` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. The user-controlled `page` value can override the return address of the function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By providing a specially crafted `page` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially allowing them to gain control of the program execution flow.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint with a large value for the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. They do not require any authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
