- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input sanitization in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the *root* user.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have high privileges.
