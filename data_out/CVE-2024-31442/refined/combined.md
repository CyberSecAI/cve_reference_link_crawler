# Incorrect permissions on all admin related commands

High

[parker02311](/parker02311)
published
GHSA-3rx8-6453-7q26
Apr 7, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.2

## Description

### Impact

All hubs before V1.0.2 are impacted. All commands on these versions are capable of being ran by all users including admin commands, this allows users to:

* Receive products for free
* Delete/create/update products/tags/etc

The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for bot owners only.

### Patches

All users should upgrade to V1.0.2 ASAP, there are no breaking changes.

### Workarounds

It will be easier to just upgrade as there is no breaking changes from V1 to V1.0.2

### For more information

You can ask any further questions on our [Discord server](https://cdn.redon.tech/go/discord) or via email

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-31442

### Weaknesses

[CWE-276](/advisories?query=cwe%3A276)
