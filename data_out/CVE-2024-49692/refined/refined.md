This could lead to various malicious activities, such as data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website through unsanitized input fields or other vulnerable entry points in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin, which might be possible through a variety of means, possibly requiring Contributor-level privileges.
