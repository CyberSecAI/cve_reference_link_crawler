## Philips Product Security **Designed-In**

In recognition of the critical role security plays across today’s interconnected digital ecosystem, Philips is committed to the articulation and execution of a comprehensive security plan that assures the safety of patient, personal, and business data. We have updated our Product Security Statement to reflect the rapidly changing security environment and our response to provide designed-in security with our products to meet the latest challenges.

        [Product Security Statement (PDF) (2.27MB)](https://www.philips.com/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.pdf "Product Security Statement (opens in a new window)")                [![product security download (.pdf) file](/c-dam/corporate/security/master/mh01/cybersecurity-paper-thumb.png "(opens in a new window)")       2.27 MB](/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.download.pdf "product security download (.pdf) file")
### Security status

Philips Product Security Status documents have product-specific vulnerability updates and security-related information such as supported anti-virus software, OS security features, and remote service.

Each product has its own table and the products are separated by modality, i.e. Informatics, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance, etc. The Status Documents list known software vulnerabilities, the current status, and Recommended Customer Action.

Revised tables are posted regularly with the latest available information.

### Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security

 As part of our commitment to product security and customer service, Philips Healthcare supplies our customers with information to help assess and address the vulnerabilities and risks associated with products that maintain or transmit ePHI.

Specifically, Philips Healthcare is using the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS²) to provide security information about its products.

The MDS² contains product specific security information such as:

* Maintaining, storing, and transmitting ePHI
* Data back-up and removable media capabilities
* Installing security patches and anti-virus software
* Remote service access
* Audit logs of ePHI access including: Viewing; creating, modifying, and deleting records; importing/exporting

The MDS², a universal reporting form which allows Philips Healthcare to supply its customers with model-specific information, is endorsed by the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute), the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).

The form also contains security practice recommendations and explanatory notes from the manufacturer as well as detailed.

        [Form](https://philips.mizecx.com/cc?tabid=867 "Form (opens in a new window)")
### Customers must register for access.

* Vue PACS: Versions prior to 12.2.8.410

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHOUT LIMITS OR THROTTLING CWE-770**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by making numerous requests or sending large amounts of data to the application, leading to resource exhaustion (e.g., memory, CPU), which can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive. This vulnerability does not expose patient data or allow for its modification. It allows an attacker, with access to the hospital's private network, which is protected by security controls (e.g., firewalls, VPNs), to send messages to the server, leading to potential CPU overload and a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. No response is sent back to the attacker, and patient information remains secure.

[CVE-2021-28165](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28165) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2021-28165](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-28165). A base score of 6.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

#### **3.2.2** [**USE OF DEFAULT CREDENTIALS CWE-1392**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1392.html)

The product does not require unique and complex passwords to be created during installation. Using Philips's default password could jeopardize the PACS system if the password was hacked or leaked. An attacker could gain access to the database impacting system availability and data integrity.

[CVE-2023-40704](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40704) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2023-40704](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40704). A base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Philips recommends the following mitigations:

* For CVE-2021-28165, Philips recommends configuring the Vue PACS environment per D000763414 – Vue\_PACS\_12\_Ports\_Protocols\_Services\_Guide available on [Incenter](https://incenter.medical.philips.com/Default.aspx?tabid=867). Vue PACS version 12.2.8.410\* released in October 2023 prevents this vulnerability.
* For CVE-2023-40704, Philips recommends no action needed due to low risk of exploitability, but customers can request that Philips update database password(s).

For managed services users, new releases will be made available upon resource availability. Releases are subject to country specific regulations. Users with questions regarding their specific Philips Vue PACS installations and new release eligibility should contact their local Philips sales representative or submit a request in the [Philips Informatics Support portal](https://www.informatics.support.philips.com/csm).

Refer to the [Philips advisory](https://www.philips.com/productsecurity) for more details.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
