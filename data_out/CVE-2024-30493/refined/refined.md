```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Church Admin WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact will vary from case to case.
- Attack vectors: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, will perform actions on the vulnerable site. This attack requires the victim to have an active session on the target site.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user of the affected website into clicking a crafted link or otherwise unknowingly submitting a malicious form, which will execute the attacker's desired action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
