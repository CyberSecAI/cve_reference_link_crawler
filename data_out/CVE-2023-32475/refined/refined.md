- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dell BIOS lacks support for integrity checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing integrity check in the BIOS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access can bypass security mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the system.
