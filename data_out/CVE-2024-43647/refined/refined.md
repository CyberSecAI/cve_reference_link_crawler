- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices do not properly handle TCP packets with an incorrect structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of TCP packets with incorrect structure leading to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition, requiring a manual restart (unplugging and re-plugging the network cable) to restore normal operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted TCP packet to the vulnerable device via network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. They do not need to be authenticated.
