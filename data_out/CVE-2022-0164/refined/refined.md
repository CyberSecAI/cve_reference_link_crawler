Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of authorization and CSRF checks in the `coming_soon_send_mail` AJAX action within the "Coming Soon and Maintenance Mode" WordPress plugin. This allows any authenticated user, including those with low-level roles like "subscriber", to trigger the email sending functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not properly verify if the user initiating the `coming_soon_send_mail` action has the necessary permissions to do so.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin lacks a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token, making it possible for an attacker to trick an authenticated user into unintentionally sending emails.
*   **Arbitrary Email Sending:**  Due to the missing authorization, a low-privileged user can send emails to all subscribed users through the plugin's mailing list functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Email Sending:** Attackers can send arbitrary emails to all users who have subscribed via the plugin's functionality. These emails could contain spam, phishing attempts, or other malicious content.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The site owner's reputation could be damaged due to the sending of unsolicited or malicious emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `coming_soon_send_mail` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, with at least a "subscriber" level role.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable AJAX action:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable action (`coming_soon_send_mail`) and the required parameters to send emails.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.6.7 of the plugin.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a simple HTTP request.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a "Broken Access Control" issue according to OWASP Top 10 and is associated with CWE-862 ("Missing Authorization").
* The CVSS score is 4.3 (medium).
