This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied XML input for the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading crafted XML configuration files that contain scripting code to a vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to *root*. An attacker would need a valid user account with the rights to upload configuration files to exploit this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-scr-web-priv-esc-k3HCGJZ>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Email Security Appliance, both virtual and hardware appliances   + Content Security Management Appliance, both virtual and hardware appliances  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco AsyncOS for Web Security Appliance Major Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 11.8 and earlier | 11.8.4-004 |   | 12.0 | 12.0.3-005 |   | 12.5 | 12.5.21 |   | 14.0 | Not affected. |      1. Release 12.5.2 will be a Maintenance Release (MR) a few days after the publication date of this security advisory. In most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the Cisco WSA web interface. To upgrade a device by using the web interface, do the following:    1. Choose **System Administration > System Upgrade**.   2. Click **Upgrade Options**.   3. Choose **Download and Install**.   4. Choose the release to upgrade to.   5. In the **Upgrade Preparation** area, choose the appropriate options.   6. Click **Proceed** to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade. After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.
