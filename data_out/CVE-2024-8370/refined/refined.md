{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly validate the 'force_serve_as' parameter when serving recipe pictures, allowing an attacker to bypass image validation checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not correctly sanitize the 'force_serve_as' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript code through a crafted SVG file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal other users' sessions by tricking them into clicking on the malicious stored link. This allows them to perform actions with the privileges of the victim user.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can upload a malicious SVG file through the recipe picture functionality, and then bypass image validation by manipulating the 'force_serve_as' parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. The attacker also needs to be able to upload files (recipe pictures) within the application."
