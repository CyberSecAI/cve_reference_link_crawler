In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: stream: fix memory leak in stream config error path

When stream config is failed, master runtime will release all
slave runtime in the slave_rt_list, but slave runtime is not
added to the list at this time. This patch frees slave runtime
in the config error path to fix the memory leak.
