Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4921 (Note: Although the CVE is a placeholder, the provided content is very specific about the vulnerability, so it is related.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of file extension validation in the `save_susers()` function within the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php` file when handling file uploads. The system fails to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without checking their extensions. This means any file type, including executable files like PHP scripts, can be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to full server compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
*  **Server Takeover:** As mentioned in the description, the attacker can directly take over the target server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint ` /employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php?f=ssave`. This request contains a malicious PHP file disguised as an image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*  **User Privilege:** The attacker needs to have access to the functionality of uploading an image (or any file) through the vulnerable form. The provided example shows the attacker using the update profile functionality of a user.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific path and parameters required to trigger the file upload vulnerability.
*   **Ability to craft a malicious file:**  The attacker should be able to create a malicious file that will be uploaded.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable function is `save_susers()` located in `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php`.
*   The code snippet shows that `move_uploaded_file()` function is used to move the uploaded file to the server without validating the filename.
*   The proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to upload a malicious PHP file and then access it to execute commands on the server. The uploaded file is placed in `/employee_gatepass/uploads/` directory.
*   The example POC uses a webshell that executes commands sent via `$_POST[1]` parameter.
