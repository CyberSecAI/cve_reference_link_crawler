Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1858

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the Lightbox slider – Responsive Lightbox Gallery WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin deserializes post meta data without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is a PHP Object Injection flaw. By crafting malicious serialized PHP objects and injecting them into post meta data, an attacker can trigger the deserialization process and potentially execute arbitrary code if a suitable POP chain is present.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin does not validate or sanitize the post meta data before deserializing it, which opens the door to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** If a suitable POP chain exists within the WordPress environment (either in the vulnerable plugin itself, another plugin, or the active theme), the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the deletion of arbitrary files or the retrieval of sensitive data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While this specific vulnerability requires contributor access, further exploitation of the PHP object injection could lead to privilege escalation within the WordPress environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network by sending a crafted request that injects malicious serialized data into a post meta field.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers require authenticated access with a minimum of "contributor" level privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that an attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid user account with at least contributor-level access.
*   The attacker needs the ability to modify post meta data, likely through the WordPress admin panel.
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious serialized PHP object.
*   The attacker needs to identify if a POP chain is present in the environment in order to fully exploit the vulnerability to execute code.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information states that no known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. However, a POP chain could be present in another plugin or theme installed on the target system, which would allow for exploitation.
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the Lightbox slider – Responsive Lightbox Gallery plugin up to and including 1.9.9.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.10.0
