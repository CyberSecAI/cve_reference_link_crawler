Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2767:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from Oracle, Debian, Ubuntu, and NetApp all relate to CVE-2020-2767. This CVE is identified within the context of security updates for OpenJDK and Java SE, specifically related to TLS handshake issues.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The core issue is that OpenJDK incorrectly handles certificate messages during the TLS handshake process.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The vulnerability allows for a bypass of certificate verification during the TLS handshake, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to insert, edit, or obtain sensitive information by circumventing proper certificate verification. This could lead to data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, or other security compromise. In some cases denial of service could occur.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through network connections using the TLS protocol when a vulnerable version of OpenJDK is in use. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack or otherwise intercept and modify the TLS handshake process. No authentication is required.

**3. Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   **Specific Impacted Versions:** The vulnerability is noted as specifically affecting OpenJDK 11 in the Ubuntu advisory, while the Oracle advisory mentions Java SE versions 11.0.6 and 14. NetApp advisory includes java versions 11.0.6, 14 and java 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14.
*   **Credit:** Bengt Jonsson, Juraj Somorovsky, Kostis Sagonas, Paul Fiterau Brostean and Robert Merget are credited for reporting the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** Applying the provided updates and patches from the respective vendors (Oracle, Debian, Ubuntu, NetApp) is the recommended remediation for this issue.

**4. Summary of Relevant Content**

The information extracted from the provided documents is consistent and provides an understanding of the vulnerability. The root cause is within the TLS handshake process in OpenJDK and related java implementations, specifically an error when processing certificate messages,  leading to certificate verification bypass. This could lead to a compromise in confidentiality, integrity, and possibly availability, and is remotely exploitable.

The documents also show the scope of affected software packages by identifying specific product versions needing patching and providing remediation steps for end users.
