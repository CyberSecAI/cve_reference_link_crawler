- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing access to certain functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user, such as a subscriber, can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies but it could potentially allow an attacker to modify data, perform unauthorized actions, or escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber or any other user with low privileges.
