# Heap overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the gatt protocol

Moderate

[Vudentz](/Vudentz)
published
GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q
Nov 12, 2021

## Package

BlueZ

## Affected versions

5.58

## Patched versions

None

## Description

In my test, this does not require pairing to perform a 0click attack

I chose ubuntu for testing

In fact, I used two gatt vulnerabilities and a memory leak vulnerability on sdp to experiment

It is easy to implement a complete 0 click attack chain

First introduce the first gatt vulnerability. This vulnerability seems to be fixed in the new version of bluez, but it has not been fixed in ubuntu. I did not search for the cve number of this vulnerability, it seems to be an internal fix.

It is the out-of-bounds reading problem in cli\_feat\_read\_cb

len = sizeof(state->cli\_feat)-offset;

value = len? &state->cli\_feat[offset]: NULL;

Unverified offset can cause the leakage of any address on the heap

I will focus on the second vulnerability

This is a heap overflow vulnerability caused by integer overflow

The calling path is prep\_write\_complete\_cb->store\_prep\_data->append\_prep\_data

uint16\_t len;

len = prep\_data->length + length;

val = realloc(prep\_data->value, len);

memcpy(val + prep\_data->length, value, length);

prep\_data->length = len;

The len here has an integer overflow vulnerability

The attacker can continue to write data to the port that allows prep write, len will become 0x0,0x200,...0xffff, and finally when 0xffff+0x100=0xff, the program executes realloc(,0xff)

But the following memcpy(val+0xffff, value, 0x100)

Caused a heap overflow

This can also cause a double free vulnerability through realloc(0)

With the above information leakage vulnerability, this can easily complete remote code execution in user mode

I choose a memory leak in sdp to try memory layout

I will report in the next report

It seems that there is no port on ubuntu in the initial state to allow prep write

So I used ordinary users to register a port through bluetoothctl in the test

The command is as follows

menu gatt

register-service 0xffff

register-characteristic 0xaaaa write

 register-application

My poc may not trigger the vulnerability because of the wrong port handle, you can adjust it yourself after obtaining the corresponding handle through the findinfo message

I don't know if some devices have the service that allows prep write enabled by default

If it exists, this vulnerability will have a serious impact

The leak.c in the attachment is a leaked poc, you may need to change the handle to use cli\_feat\_read

double.c causes double free

Over.c causes heap overflow, which may not crash

The dump file is the scene when double free crashed

Package        : bluez
Version        : 5.50-1.2~deb10u3

Debian Bug     : 998626 1000262 1003712

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth
protocol stack. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or
leak information.

CVE-2019-8921

    SDP infoleak, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a
    SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a
    malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into
    returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in
    leaking arbitrary heap data.

CVE-2019-8922

    SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol
    handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge
    number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow
    the static buffer provided to hold the response.

CVE-2021-41229

    sdp_cstate_alloc_buf allocates memory which will always be hung in
    the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will
    cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large
    object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending
    sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to
    crash.

CVE-2021-43400

    A use-after-free in gatt-database.c can occur when a client
    disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.

CVE-2022-0204

    A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An attacker with
    local network access could pass specially crafted files causing an
    application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2022-39176

    BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive
    information because profiles/audio/avrcp.c does not validate
    params_len.

CVE-2022-39177

    BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
    service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
    processed in profiles/audio/avdtp.c.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.50-1.2~deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

For the detailed security status of bluez please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-12 13:40:19 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in BlueZ in the implementation of the gatt protocol due to an integer overflow.  Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/591c546c536b42bef696d027f64aa22434f8c3f0>  Reference:  <https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-12 13:40:37 UTC  ``` Created bluez tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2039808](show_bug.cgi?id=2039808 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2022-0204 bluez: heap-based buffer overflow in the implementation of the gatt protocol [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c3)  juneau    2022-01-12 15:06:24 UTC  ``` Marking services not affected for Bluetooth vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-01-12 16:00:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-0204>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c5)  John Helmert III    2022-03-19 05:10:12 UTC  ``` The Github advisory referenced by the CVE (<https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q>) seems to claim this vulnerability can result in remote code execution, but the CVE says the impact is only denial of service. Why the discrepancy?  Also, for the benefit of downstreams, can a reference to the patch be added to the CVE?   ``` |  |
