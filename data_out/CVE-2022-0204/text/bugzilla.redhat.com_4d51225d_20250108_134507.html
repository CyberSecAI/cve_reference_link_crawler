| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-12 13:40:19 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in BlueZ in the implementation of the gatt protocol due to an integer overflow.  Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/591c546c536b42bef696d027f64aa22434f8c3f0>  Reference:  <https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-12 13:40:37 UTC  ``` Created bluez tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2039808](show_bug.cgi?id=2039808 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2022-0204 bluez: heap-based buffer overflow in the implementation of the gatt protocol [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c3)  juneau    2022-01-12 15:06:24 UTC  ``` Marking services not affected for Bluetooth vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-01-12 16:00:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-0204>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2039807#c5)  John Helmert III    2022-03-19 05:10:12 UTC  ``` The Github advisory referenced by the CVE (<https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q>) seems to claim this vulnerability can result in remote code execution, but the CVE says the impact is only denial of service. Why the discrepancy?  Also, for the benefit of downstreams, can a reference to the patch be added to the CVE?   ``` |  |
