# Heap overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the gatt protocol

Moderate

[Vudentz](/Vudentz)
published
GHSA-479m-xcq5-9g2q
Nov 12, 2021

## Package

BlueZ

## Affected versions

5.58

## Patched versions

None

## Description

In my test, this does not require pairing to perform a 0click attack

I chose ubuntu for testing

In fact, I used two gatt vulnerabilities and a memory leak vulnerability on sdp to experiment

It is easy to implement a complete 0 click attack chain

First introduce the first gatt vulnerability. This vulnerability seems to be fixed in the new version of bluez, but it has not been fixed in ubuntu. I did not search for the cve number of this vulnerability, it seems to be an internal fix.

It is the out-of-bounds reading problem in cli\_feat\_read\_cb

len = sizeof(state->cli\_feat)-offset;

value = len? &state->cli\_feat[offset]: NULL;

Unverified offset can cause the leakage of any address on the heap

I will focus on the second vulnerability

This is a heap overflow vulnerability caused by integer overflow

The calling path is prep\_write\_complete\_cb->store\_prep\_data->append\_prep\_data

uint16\_t len;

len = prep\_data->length + length;

val = realloc(prep\_data->value, len);

memcpy(val + prep\_data->length, value, length);

prep\_data->length = len;

The len here has an integer overflow vulnerability

The attacker can continue to write data to the port that allows prep write, len will become 0x0,0x200,...0xffff, and finally when 0xffff+0x100=0xff, the program executes realloc(,0xff)

But the following memcpy(val+0xffff, value, 0x100)

Caused a heap overflow

This can also cause a double free vulnerability through realloc(0)

With the above information leakage vulnerability, this can easily complete remote code execution in user mode

I choose a memory leak in sdp to try memory layout

I will report in the next report

It seems that there is no port on ubuntu in the initial state to allow prep write

So I used ordinary users to register a port through bluetoothctl in the test

The command is as follows

menu gatt

register-service 0xffff

register-characteristic 0xaaaa write

 register-application

My poc may not trigger the vulnerability because of the wrong port handle, you can adjust it yourself after obtaining the corresponding handle through the findinfo message

I don't know if some devices have the service that allows prep write enabled by default

If it exists, this vulnerability will have a serious impact

The leak.c in the attachment is a leaked poc, you may need to change the handle to use cli\_feat\_read

double.c causes double free

Over.c causes heap overflow, which may not crash

The dump file is the scene when double free crashed
