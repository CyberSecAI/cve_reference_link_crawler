# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-2013

## NVIDIA D3D10 Driver Shader Functionality out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to excessive loop iteration

##### October 23, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-0118

##### SUMMARY

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Shader Functionality functionality of NVIDIA D3D10 Driver 555.99, 32.0.15.5599. A specially crafted executable / shader file can lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

NVIDIA D3D10 Driver 555.99, 32.0.15.5599

##### PRODUCT URLS

NVIDIA D3D10 Driver - <https://nvidia.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

##### DETAILS

This vulnerability potentially could be triggered from guest machines running virtualization environments (ie. VMware, qemu, VirtualBox etc.) in order to perform guest-to-host escape - as it was demonstrated before (TALOS-2018-0533, TALOS-2018-0568, etc.). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly). We were able to trigger this vulnerability from HYPER-V guest using RemoteFX feature leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). While the RemoteFX was recently depracated by Microsoft some older machines may still use this software.

This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a malformed shader. This leads to out-of-bounds memory read problem in NVIDIA driver.

To trigger the bug we have modified and CUSTOMDATA section in the shader bytecode. The modified value is later used as maximum number of repetitions for the loop, during this loop read operation is performed while the memory address specifying the memory region is being adjusted.

This leads to out-of-bounds memory read situation:

```
	00007FF9EE7AB4B0 | 0F2941 10                | movaps xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+10],xmm0     |

	00007FF9EE7AB4DA | 49:FFC9                  | dec r9                                  |		*

	00007FF9EE7AB4E5 | 0F104411 30              | movups xmm0,xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+rdx+30] |
	00007FF9EE7AB4EA | 0F104C11 20              | movups xmm1,xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+rdx+20] |
	00007FF9EE7AB4EF | 0F2941 30                | movaps xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+30],xmm0     |
	00007FF9EE7AB4F3 | 0F2949 20                | movaps xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+20],xmm1     |
	00007FF9EE7AB4F7 | 0F104411 10              | movups xmm0,xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+rdx+10] |
	00007FF9EE7AB4FC | 0F100C11                 | movups xmm1,xmmword ptr ds:[rcx+rdx]    |
	00007FF9EE7AB500 | 75 AE                    | jne nvwgf2umx.7FF9EE7AB4B0              |

```

Here the value of r9 (being the remaining loop counter) is taken directly from the shaderbyte code. Attacker can influce the number of loop repeats which will eventually lead to out-of-bounds reads (because the RCX register specifying the memory address for reading is being adjusted every loop iteration).
