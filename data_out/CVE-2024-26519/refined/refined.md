- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NetComm NTC-221 Industrial IoT M2M LTE/4G Router firmware does not adequately sanitize user input in some web interface fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote control over the router.
    - Eavesdropping on network traffic, intercepting, altering, or monitoring messages.
    - Installing malware.
    - Launching DDoS attacks.
    - Propagation of malicious software to other connected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious payload to the router's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access to the router's web interface. No authentication is needed for initial exploitation.
