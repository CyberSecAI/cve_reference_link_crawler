Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `replaceUrlsWithLink` function in `nc-gui/utils/urlUtils.ts` sanitizes text by encoding HTML but doesn't sanitize text outside of the `URI::(XXX)` pattern. This allows users to inject arbitrary HTML content via a formula field, which is later rendered via `v-html`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied data.
- Improper use of `v-html` which renders unsanitized user input as HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can create a malicious table with a formula field containing malicious JavaScript.
- When a victim opens a shared link to the malicious table, the attacker's JavaScript code is executed within the victim's browser.
- This can result in stealing of user credentials (e.g., stored in `localStorage`) and other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker crafts malicious data via a formula field in a NocoDB table.
- The attacker shares this table publicly via a shared link.
- A victim opens the shared link in their browser, causing the malicious script to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs an account in NocoDB to create the malicious table and formula.
- The attacker needs the ability to enable public sharing of the malicious table.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious payload.
- The attacker is positioned as a user that can create/modify NocoDB content
