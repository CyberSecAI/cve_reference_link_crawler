Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9353

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in the Popularis Extra plugin for WordPress. These functions are used to construct URLs, but the plugin does not properly escape the URL parameters, allowing for injection of malicious code through URL manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that the malicious script is embedded in a crafted URL, and it executes in the user's browser when they click on the link and the server reflects the malicious input back to the user.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:**  The plugin fails to sanitize or encode URL parameters before using them to construct links within the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user clicks on a maliciously crafted link, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities:
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    - Stealing cookies or session data
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link that contains the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to create and distribute a crafted URL.
- The attacker relies on the user clicking the link to execute the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions up to and including 1.2.6 of the Popularis Extra plugin.
- The patched version is 1.2.7.
- The vulnerability is present in the `includes/wizard/wizard.php` file, specifically related to how the `get_next_step_link` function constructs URLs.

The provided content also includes a diff of the vulnerable code in `includes/wizard/wizard.php` with the fix, showing that the vulnerability was fixed by properly escaping the output of `$this->get_next_step_link()` with `esc_url`.
