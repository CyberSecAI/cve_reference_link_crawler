  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input used to construct file paths or directory locations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal vulnerability allowing access to files and directories outside of the intended scope of the web application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially view sensitive files, execute arbitrary code, or perform unauthorized actions on the server. In this specific case, the attacker can perform Directory Listing and steal files.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted request to the /data/ endpoint.",
