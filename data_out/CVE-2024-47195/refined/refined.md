- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `gdb.exe` executable in affected applications loads a specific executable file from the current working directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427), allowing for DLL hijacking/planting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to place a malicious executable with the expected name in a directory where `gdb.exe` will be launched from by a privileged user/process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to write files in a directory where `gdb.exe` will be executed and must also have local access and valid credentials. The user needs to execute `gdb.exe` from a user-writable directory for the vulnerability to be triggered.
