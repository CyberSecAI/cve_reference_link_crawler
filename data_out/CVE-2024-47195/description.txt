A vulnerability has been identified in ModelSim (All versions < V2024.3), Questa (All versions < V2024.3). gdb.exe in affected applications allows a specific executable file to be loaded from the current working directory. This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges in installations where administrators or processes with elevated privileges launch gdb.exe from a user-writable directory.
