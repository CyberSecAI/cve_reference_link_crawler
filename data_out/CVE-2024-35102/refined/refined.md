Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2024-35102:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AvediaServer API lacks proper authentication. Specifically, the API endpoints for managing users and profiles are accessible without any authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The API endpoints `/api/auth/users`, `/api/auth/users/{id}`, and `/api/auth/profiles` do not require authentication, allowing unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** User details can be accessed via the `/api/auth/users/{id}` endpoint by using the user's ID.
*   **Insecure User Creation:**  The lack of authentication allows an attacker to create new users, including administrative users, via a POST request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve a list of all users, details of individual users (including encrypted passwords), and user profiles (admin, asset manager, etc.).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can create a new user with administrative privileges, gaining full control over the system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can gain access to the system by using the created admin account.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated API Requests:** Attackers send GET requests to the vulnerable API endpoints to gather user information and profiles.
*  **POST Request:** Attackers send POST requests to create new users with desired privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the AvediaServer device. The blog post mentions that the author found several devices exposed to the internet via Shodan and Google Dorking.
*   **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs a tool capable of sending HTTP requests (e.g., `curl`, a web browser, or a custom script).

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in AvediaServer version 8.6.2-1, running on the `avsrv-m8105` product on the `mavsrv-c1520` platform.
*   The author of the blog post reported that VITEC confirmed the vulnerability.
*   The blog provides examples of the HTTP requests used to exploit the vulnerability, including URLs and POST parameters.
