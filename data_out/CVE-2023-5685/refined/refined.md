  "cve": "CVE-2023-5685",
  "description": "A flaw was found in XNIO. The XNIO NotifierState can cause a StackOverflowException when the chain of notifier states becomes problematically large, which may lead to uncontrolled resource management and a possible denial of service (DoS).",
  "affected_products": [
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 EUS for RHEL 7",
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3 EUS for RHEL 7",
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 7",
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8",
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9",
    "Red Hat Integration - Camel for Spring Boot 1"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises due to the way XNIO manages notifier states. When the chain of these states becomes excessively long, it leads to a StackOverflowException.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
      "Recursive chain leading to stack overflow"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS) due to uncontrolled resource management.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "A specially crafted series of requests to the affected service could trigger the long chain of notifier states"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests"
    ]
