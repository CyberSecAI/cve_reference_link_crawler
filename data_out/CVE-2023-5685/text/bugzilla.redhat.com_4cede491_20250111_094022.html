The issue involves the XNIO NotifierState, which can lead to a Stack Overflow Exception when the chain of notifier states becomes excessively large. This happens because the system is unable to handle the large recursive chain, which in turn could result in uncontrolled resource management. As a consequence, this could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the overconsumption of system resources.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2241822#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-25 00:10:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 EUS for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:10208 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10208](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10208)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2241822#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-25 00:11:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3 EUS for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:10207 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10207](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10207)   ``` |  |
