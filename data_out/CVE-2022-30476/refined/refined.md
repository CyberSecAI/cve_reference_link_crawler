- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetFirewallCfg` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `strcpy` function is used without proper length checks when copying the user-provided `firewallEn` parameter into a stack-based buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by sending a crafted `firewallEn` parameter.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a GET request to `/goform/SetFirewallCfg` with an overly long `firewallEn` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda Router. No special privileges are required.
