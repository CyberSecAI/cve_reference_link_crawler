The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42460. It describes a vulnerability in the `elliptic` library related to missing checks during the decoding of ECDSA and EDDSA signatures, leading to signature malleability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the missing checks during the decoding process of ECDSA and EDDSA signatures within the `elliptic` library. Specifically:

*   **EDDSA:** A missing length check during signature creation allows for the removal or appending of zero bytes to the signature.
*   **ECDSA:**
    *   Missing check to ensure the leading bit of 'r' and 's' in the signature is zero, as required by ASN.1 encoding.
    *   The library was also allowing BER encoded signatures instead of strictly DER encoded, which allows for leading zeros in the length sequence.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Signature Malleability:** The lack of proper checks allows for manipulating signatures without invalidating them. This could lead to various attacks, such as transaction replay or other forms of data manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Security risks related to signature verification.** The primary risk is signature malleability. This means an attacker could alter a signature without invalidating it, leading to potential issues like replay attacks and other security breaches. The specific consequences would depend on how the affected library is used in different applications.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can modify the signature by appending or removing zero bytes in the case of EDDSA, or by manipulating the 'r' and 's' components of the ECDSA signatures in ways that would be invalid according to the proper encoding rules, which would nonetheless be accepted by vulnerable versions of the library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the signature before it is verified. The attacker doesn't need to know the private key, but they would need the ability to intercept and change the signatures.
