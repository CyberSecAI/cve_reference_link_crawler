Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Affected Software:** Kashipara College Management System version 1.0 or lower

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `activity_datetime` parameter of the `submit_extracurricular_activity.php` file before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user or system data can be leaked.
*   **Compromised System Security:** The system's overall security can be compromised, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **HTTP Request:**  An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `submit_extracurricular_activity.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code within the `activity_datetime` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the `activity_datetime` parameter and the vulnerable `submit_extracurricular_activity.php` file.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided payload `activity_datetime=1'+(SELECT 1 AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))v))+'` demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection. This payload leverages the `SLEEP()` function, which will cause a delay if the injected SQL is executed, allowing an attacker to confirm the presence of the vulnerability and potentially extract data.

This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, which often only states the existence of a SQL injection vulnerability and not the specific vulnerable file and parameter.
