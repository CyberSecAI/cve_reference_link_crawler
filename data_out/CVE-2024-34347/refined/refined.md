Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34347:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `@hoppscotch/js-sandbox` package used Node.js's `vm` module for sandboxing pre-request scripts in the Hoppscotch CLI. The `vm` module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted JavaScript code because code inside the vm context can break out if it gets a hold of an object created outside of the vm context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure sandboxing:** The use of Node.js's `vm` module for sandboxing user-provided JavaScript pre-request scripts is inherently flawed.
- **External object references:** References to external objects (like the `pw` object for environment variables interaction) were passed into the vm context, allowing a sandbox escape.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the machine running the Hoppscotch CLI by crafting a malicious pre-request script.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Hoppscotch collection:** An attacker creates a Hoppscotch collection containing a request with a malicious pre-request script.
- **JSON export/import:** The attacker shares the malicious collection via JSON export, and the victim imports/runs it using the Hoppscotch CLI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a Hoppscotch collection with a crafted, malicious pre-request script.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim into importing and running this malicious collection using the Hoppscotch CLI.
- The attacker has no initial access or privileges required on the victim's machine other than enticing them to run the code in their local environment.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability only affects Hoppscotch CLI and tools that rely on `@hoppscotch/js-sandbox` using the Node.js `vm` module. Hoppscotch Web and Desktop are not affected as they use web workers for sandboxing.
- The provided code shows a PoC pre-request script that can execute system commands by using `pw.constructor.constructor('return this')()` to access the global scope of the node environment. Then accessing node functions using `outside.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id > /tmp/pwnd')` to execute system commands.
- The vulnerability was fixed by migrating to `isolated-vm` for Node.js environments.
- The commit diffs show the changes made to the Hoppscotch CLI to address this vulnerability. Notably, the `hopp.js` file was modified to include the `--no-node-snapshot` argument for Node.js version 20 and above when using the `isolated-vm` library and the upgrade of the `@hoppscotch/cli` package.

This is a High severity vulnerability according to the CVSS score of 8.4, due to the potential for arbitrary command execution.
