| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2268268#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-06 20:39:22 UTC  ``` A timing based side-channel exists in the libgcrypt RSA implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OAEP, and RSASVE.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2268268#c1)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-06 20:46:51 UTC  ``` Created libgcrypt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2268271](show_bug.cgi?id=2268271 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - TRIAGE CVE-2024-2236 libgcrypt: timing based side-channel in RSA implementation [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-libgcrypt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2268272](show_bug.cgi?id=2268272 "NEW - TRIAGE CVE-2024-2236 mingw-libgcrypt: libgcrypt: timing based side-channel in RSA implementation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2268268#c5)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-08 00:42:53 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 2245218](show_bug.cgi?id=2245218 "NEW - CVE-2024-2236 libgcrypt: vulnerable to Marvin Attack") ***   ```   [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2268268#c6)  Charmaine9x    2024-03-19 03:37:22 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` This comment was flagged a spam, view the edit history to see the original text if required.   ``` |  |
