Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-2236:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in libgcrypt's RSA implementation. This is related to the Marvin Attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Timing side-channel vulnerability in RSA implementation within libgcrypt
- The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OAEP, and RSASVE.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can initiate a Bleichenbacher-style attack.
- Successful exploitation can lead to the decryption of RSA ciphertexts, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker, likely over a network.
- The attacker needs to send a large number of trial messages for decryption.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send multiple messages to the target system to trigger decryption operations.
- The attacker must be able to measure the timing of these operations to exploit the side-channel.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is tracked upstream at <https://dev.gnupg.org/T7136>.
- Patches are available at <https://gitlab.com/redhat-crypto/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-mirror/-/merge_requests/19>.
- Red Hat has issued RHSA-2024:9404 to address this vulnerability.
- The fix is included in libgcrypt version 1.10.0-11.el9 and later.
