- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The remote hardware module of the firmware lacks proper checks to ensure the validity of received remote hardware control messages. Specifically, there is no verification of the channel from which the message is received.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing channel verification for remote hardware control messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially send unauthorized control messages to the remote hardware module, leading to low confidentiality and integrity impacts, with high availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network and does not require any privileges or user interaction. Attack complexity is rated as high.
