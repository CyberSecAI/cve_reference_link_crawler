- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ConnectionPoolOptions` type in the MongoDB Rust Driver includes user credentials and is used for both internal connection pool management and external event monitoring. This causes the user's credentials to be included in monitoring events, which can be inadvertently exposed through logging infrastructure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information. The `ConnectionPoolOptions` type stores user credentials and uses those credentials in monitoring events.
- **Impact of exploitation:** User credentials can be leaked to system logs via the event monitoring system. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially obtain credentials by monitoring logs if the application has enabled connection pool event monitoring.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the logs where the monitoring events are being written. The attacker also needs to have the appropriate user privileges on the system to view log files.
