- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Type Confusion (CWE-843). The software attempts to access a resource using an incompatible type, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type confusion vulnerability, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction. The user would likely need to open a malicious document to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious document or file.
