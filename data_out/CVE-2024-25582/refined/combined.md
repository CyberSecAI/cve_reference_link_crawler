Please read this section carefully before updating and follow the guidance. We highly recommend
to prepare the update on a staging or test system in advance.
Google has officially announced the deprecation of the existing HTTP API for sending push notifica-
tions via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), effective from June 20, 2023, with plans to shut it down
on June 21, 2024. As a replacement, a new FCM API, known as ”v1,” has been introduced. More
information regarding migration is provided at: https://documentation.open-xchange.com/7.10.

4 Bugs fixed since previous Public Release

This section provides a summary of bug fixes and changes that have been applied subsequently to
shipping Patch Release #6272.

OXUIB-2741 Translation issue in Italian language
This has been solved by adding missing translation.

OXUIB-2756 Wrong calendar week when scheduling an appointment (U.S. language setting)
Bug in moment js. ISO week should be 10 (week 3.3 - 9.3) no matter which locale/timezone. Unfor-
tunately, moment.js seems to consider the weekstart. This way It became week 9 instead.
This has been solved by using locale dependent calendar week.

Was caused by an old design decision.
This has been solved by adjusting the design decision.

6 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.
