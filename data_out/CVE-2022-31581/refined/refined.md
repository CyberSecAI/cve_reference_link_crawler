The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join` with user-controlled input, specifically the `filename` or `path` parameters. The `os.path.join` call, when given an absolute path, ignores any preceding path components, making it unsafe for sanitizing file paths. This allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability due to insecure handling of file paths.
- Improper use of `flask.send_file` with untrusted input.
- Unsafe use of `os.path.join` which does not properly sanitize absolute paths

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file access: An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the server, including source code, configuration files, and other system files.
- Information disclosure: Access to sensitive data may lead to further attacks or compromise of the system.
- Partial denial of service: An attacker might be able to cause a partial denial of service by making multiple requests for large files.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) or absolute file paths in the `filename` or `path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication: Typically, no authentication is needed, as the vulnerability lies in how the application processes the file path parameter.
