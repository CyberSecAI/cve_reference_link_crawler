| Open5GS Release, Revision, or Tag v2.6.4 Steps to reproduce According to "Building Open5GS from Sources," I compiled Open5GS with ASAN on ubuntu 20.04. After the compilation was completed, I ran meson test -v in the build directory, and ASAN reported the following information:  ==23232==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: dynamic-stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7ffc12a4a898 at pc 0x7f275967feda bp 0x7ffc12a4a530 sp 0x7ffc12a4a528 WRITE of size 8 at 0x7ffc12a4a898 thread T0 #0 0x7f275967fed9 in abts\_main /home/lxy/Downloads/open5gs-main/build/../lib/core/abts.c:592:17 [#1](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/1) 0x4f3c0e in main /home/lxy/Downloads/open5gs-main/build/../tests/core/abts-main.c:85:10 [#2](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2) 0x7f2759295082 in \_\_libc\_start\_main /build/glibc-SzIz7B/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16 [#3](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/3) 0x41ebad in \_start (/home/lxy/Downloads/open5gs-main/build/tests/core/core+0x41ebad)  Address 0x7ffc12a4a898 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 856 in frame #0 0x7f275967f2df in abts\_main /home/lxy/Downloads/open5gs-main/build/../lib/core/abts.c:506  This frame has 2 object(s): [32, 136) 'options' (line 509) [176, 208) 'optarg' (line 510) <== Memory access at offset 856 overflows this variable HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported) SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: dynamic-stack-buffer-overflow /home/lxy/Downloads/open5gs-main/build/../lib/core/abts.c:592:17 in abts\_main Shadow bytes around the buggy address: 0x1000025414c0: 00 00 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x1000025414d0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x1000025414e0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x1000025414f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x100002541500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ca ca ca ca =>0x100002541510: 00 00 00[cb]cb cb cb cb f1 f1 f1 f1 00 00 00 00 0x100002541520: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 00 00 0x100002541530: f2 f2 00 00 00 00 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 00 00 00 00 0x100002541540: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x100002541550: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x100002541560: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes): Addressable: 00 Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Heap left redzone: fa Freed heap region: fd Stack left redzone: f1 Stack mid redzone: f2 Stack right redzone: f3 Stack after return: f5 Stack use after scope: f8 Global redzone: f9 Global init order: f6 Poisoned by user: f7 Container overflow: fc Array cookie: ac Intra object redzone: bb ASan internal: fe Left alloca redzone: ca Right alloca redzone: cb Shadow gap: cc ==23232==ABORTING 1/13 open5gs:unit / core FAIL 0.12 s (exit status 1) Logs ``` The same issue has been identified in other test cases as well.

I would like to propose modifying the code to const char\* argv\_out[argc + 3]; to prevent further buffer overflow issues. I am not quite sure whether this is a bug, any feedback would be appreciated! Observed Behaviour ASAN reported dynamic-stack-buffer-overflow in /lib/core/abts.c:592:17 and the test failed eNodeB/gNodeB *No response* UE Models and versions *No response* |

Registration type label is not provided.
A nonstandard PLMNID label is added to achieve uniqueness.

- 5.3.1.3 Number of PDU sessions requested to be created by the SMF

PLMNID and SNSSAI are defined during PDU session creation processing.
Some requests can be rejected during processing before label values are known.
Those requests are not counted under particular labels.
To count also such requests, the basic metric with empty labels is exposed too.

```

* [SBI,NAS] Fix conversion of bitrate between OpenAPI/NAS and internal representation

From the OpenAPI document,TS29571_CommonData.yaml : BitRate
String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International
System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix \"K\" is
used to represent the standard symbol \"k\".

* [NAS] Improve algorithm for conversion of bitrate to NAS

The improved algorithm better handles some odd bitrates.
With the current version, the bitrates 63 Kbps and 65 Kbps would get
converted into 48 Kbps (unit 16 Kbps x 3) and 64 Kbps (unit 64 Kbps x
1).
Especially in the first case, the conversion error is quite signicant.

Current version tries to find the biggest 'unit', while the 'value' is
still above 0.
With the updated version, the algorithm tries to find the 'unit' low
enough, that the resulting 'value' can still fit into the 16-bit space
without overflow.

* [PFCP] Fix calculation of AMBR

When converting bitrates from bits per second to kilobits per second,
if the conversion results in fractions, the resulting value should be
rounded upwards

* [SMF] Fix typo in log line

* [PCF] Fix calculation of NF Instance load information

- the 'if' clause was comparing some value with an always '1' due to
wrong calculation. Consequently, this 'if' statement never executed.
- sizes for session pool and UE pools are directly linked between each
other. We need to count the number of items only in one of the pools to
correctly represent the NF load
- if anything, we should also check the load of the application pool to
determine correct load of the NF

* [AMF,SMF,PCF] Rename the function for calculating NF Instance load

- have a more consistent naming among the NF's
- always have the same prefix (amf_/smf_/pcf_) depending on the NF
- function name is always the same, how the function calculates the load
is NF specific and internal to the function itself (but not the function
name).

* [SMF] Fix a use-after-free bug

* [SMF] Fix Gx/Gy assert() if more than 64 CCRs are sent

The current code uses the cc request number as an index to the
transaction array (xact/xact_data). Since cc request number is a 32 bit
integer this is unfeasible for longer sessions and if more than a
handful of messages are exchanged per session.

The array size was already increased in #2038 which simply delays the
issue.
Furthermore, the current code asserts that cc_request_number is <=
MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER which leads to an out-of-bounds write if
cc_request_number == MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER.

Instead use a smaller array and index into it using cc_request_number
% array size. More than 2 requests should never be in flight at any one
time (initial or update request together with a termination request) so
an array size of 4 should be fine.

* [SMF] Decrease sessions metric on OLD Session Release

Since [redesign](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/8553c77733f50f82bfa6a9a4ee57f7ca0133a815)
of fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr gauge, the metric doesn't
expose some decrements. The decreasing of gauge had been
moved out of function stats_remove_smf_session.

It should be decreased every time stats_remove_smf_session
is called, but this particular case is easily reproducible
by killing UPF while the session is established.

that AMF checked only the first SmfInfo for correct S-NSSAI/NR-TAI

In case of a 5G core setup with SMF handling 2 or more slices, and UE
trying to establish multiple PDU sessions, AMF would report an error
when trying to find the correct serving SMF.

* [AMF] Implicit Deregistration (Reset, ConnRefused)

When AMF release the NAS signalling connection,
ran_ue context is removed by ran_ue_remove() and
amf_ue/ran_ue is de-associated by amf_ue_deassociate().

In this case, implicit deregistration is attempted
by the mobile reachable timer according to the standard document,
and amf_ue will be removed by amf_ue_remove().

TS 24.501
5.3.7 Handling of the periodic registration update timer and

The network supervises the periodic registration update procedure
of the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer.
If the UE is not registered for emergency services,
the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than the value of timer
T3512. In this case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is
4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3512.
The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the
value as indicated above, when the AMF releases the NAS signalling
connection for the UE.

So, first of all, I deleted the related code.

- TS 24.301 Ch 5.3.7
If ISR is not activated, the network behaviour upon expiry of
the mobile reachable timer is network dependent, but typically
the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the
first expiry, and may take other appropriate actions

* [TLV] PFCP parser crash from FuzzingLabs (#2523)

* [SBI] nghttp2 SETTING ACK should be sent (#2385)

Whether or not to send a Setting ACK is determined by the nghttp2 library.
Therefore, when nghttp2 informs us that it want to send an SETTING frame
with ACK by nghttp2_session_want_write(), we need to call session_send()
directly to send it.

* [WebUI] Fixed a crash when editing Subscribe

After the UE performs Registration/Attach, SQN field is created.

If we edit subscriber information when SQN value is present, WebUI crash occurs.

It is because the way to handle Long Type(SQN:Long) is different
when the mongoose version is 6 or higher.

To avoid this crash, we use the mongoose version down to 5.x first.

* [SMF] Deregister issue during sess release (#2537)

A situation in which you establish two sessions and release both of them.

the second SESSION.

At this point, when the UE tried to do a deregistration,
the SMF was not properly handling the exception.

I've just fixed this.

SMF crashes as not able to decode the message properly. SmContextCreateData is not accessible.

* [GTPU] Fixed PDCP SN handling (#2584, #2477)

Scenario is handover on S1AP, data forwarding is enabled, and
the Source ENB is forwarding DL PDCP packets to EPC(SGWU)
with PDCP SN included. SGWU is also forwarding these packets
to the Target ENB.

However the PDCP SN is not present in the forwarded packets
from SGWU to Target ENB.

I modified this part, and there was the same problem in 5GC, fixed it as well.

A lot of code in GTP-U has been modified,
so if you have any problems, please let us know right away.

* Minor change to address timer warnings and erros in upf, patch for upf bearer removal when sgw restarts

Compared with ogs_pool_init()

ogs_pool_create() could be called while the process is running,
so this function should use ogs_malloc() instead of system malloc()

* [Docs] Update night build URI

* [SBI,NAS] Fix conversion of bitrate between OpenAPI/NAS and internal representation

From the OpenAPI document,TS29571_CommonData.yaml : BitRate
String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International
System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix \"K\" is
used to represent the standard symbol \"k\".

* [NAS] Improve algorithm for conversion of bitrate to NAS

The improved algorithm better handles some odd bitrates.
With the current version, the bitrates 63 Kbps and 65 Kbps would get
converted into 48 Kbps (unit 16 Kbps x 3) and 64 Kbps (unit 64 Kbps x
1).
Especially in the first case, the conversion error is quite signicant.

Current version tries to find the biggest 'unit', while the 'value' is
still above 0.
With the updated version, the algorithm tries to find the 'unit' low
enough, that the resulting 'value' can still fit into the 16-bit space
without overflow.

* [PFCP] Fix calculation of AMBR

When converting bitrates from bits per second to kilobits per second,
if the conversion results in fractions, the resulting value should be
rounded upwards

* [PCF] Fix calculation of NF Instance load information

- the 'if' clause was comparing some value with an always '1' due to
wrong calculation. Consequently, this 'if' statement never executed.
- sizes for session pool and UE pools are directly linked between each
other. We need to count the number of items only in one of the pools to
correctly represent the NF load
- if anything, we should also check the load of the application pool to
determine correct load of the NF

* [AMF,SMF,PCF] Rename the function for calculating NF Instance load

- have a more consistent naming among the NF's
- always have the same prefix (amf_/smf_/pcf_) depending on the NF
- function name is always the same, how the function calculates the load
is NF specific and internal to the function itself (but not the function
name).

* [SMF] Fix a use-after-free bug

* [SMF] Fix Gx/Gy assert() if more than 64 CCRs are sent

The current code uses the cc request number as an index to the
transaction array (xact/xact_data). Since cc request number is a 32 bit
integer this is unfeasible for longer sessions and if more than a
handful of messages are exchanged per session.

The array size was already increased in #2038 which simply delays the
issue.
Furthermore, the current code asserts that cc_request_number is <=
MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER which leads to an out-of-bounds write if
cc_request_number == MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER.

Instead use a smaller array and index into it using cc_request_number
% array size. More than 2 requests should never be in flight at any one
time (initial or update request together with a termination request) so
an array size of 4 should be fine.

* [SMF] Decrease sessions metric on OLD Session Release

Since [redesign](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/8553c77733f50f82bfa6a9a4ee57f7ca0133a815)
of fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr gauge, the metric doesn't
expose some decrements. The decreasing of gauge had been
moved out of function stats_remove_smf_session.

It should be decreased every time stats_remove_smf_session
is called, but this particular case is easily reproducible
by killing UPF while the session is established.

Each SMF's NfProfile can contain multiple SmfInfo items. The issue was
that AMF checked only the first SmfInfo for correct S-NSSAI/NR-TAI

In case of a 5G core setup with SMF handling 2 or more slices, and UE
trying to establish multiple PDU sessions, AMF would report an error
when trying to find the correct serving SMF.

* [AMF] Implicit Deregistration (Reset, ConnRefused)

When AMF release the NAS signalling connection,
ran_ue context is removed by ran_ue_remove() and
amf_ue/ran_ue is de-associated by amf_ue_deassociate().

In this case, implicit deregistration is attempted
by the mobile reachable timer according to the standard document,
and amf_ue will be removed by amf_ue_remove().

TS 24.501
5.3.7 Handling of the periodic registration update timer and

The network supervises the periodic registration update procedure
of the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer.

the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than the value of timer
T3512. In this case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is
4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3512.
The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the
value as indicated above, when the AMF releases the NAS signalling
connection for the UE.

* [TLV] PFCP parser crash from FuzzingLabs (#2523)

Whether or not to send a Setting ACK is determined by the nghttp2 library.
Therefore, when nghttp2 informs us that it want to send an SETTING frame
with ACK by nghttp2_session_want_write(), we need to call session_send()
directly to send it.

* [WebUI] Fixed a crash when editing Subscribe

After the UE performs Registration/Attach, SQN field is created.

If we edit subscriber information when SQN value is present, WebUI crash occurs.

It is because the way to handle Long Type(SQN:Long) is different
when the mongoose version is 6 or higher.

To avoid this crash, we use the mongoose version down to 5.x first.

* [SMF] Deregister issue during sess release (#2537)

A situation in which you establish two sessions and release both of them.

the second SESSION.

At this point, when the UE tried to do a deregistration,
the SMF was not properly handling the exception.

I've just fixed this.

with PDCP SN included. SGWU is also forwarding these packets
to the Target ENB.

However the PDCP SN is not present in the forwarded packets
from SGWU to Target ENB.

I modified this part, and there was the same problem in 5GC, fixed it as well.

A lot of code in GTP-U has been modified,
so if you have any problems, please let us know right away.

* [SBI,NAS] Fix conversion of bitrate between OpenAPI/NAS and internal representation

From the OpenAPI document,TS29571_CommonData.yaml : BitRate
String representing a bit rate; the prefixes follow the standard symbols from The International
System of Units, and represent x1000 multipliers, with the exception that prefix "K" is
used to represent the standard symbol "k".

* [NAS] Improve algorithm for conversion of bitrate to NAS

The improved algorithm better handles some odd bitrates.
With the current version, the bitrates 63 Kbps and 65 Kbps would get
converted into 48 Kbps (unit 16 Kbps x 3) and 64 Kbps (unit 64 Kbps x
1).
Especially in the first case, the conversion error is quite signicant.

Current version tries to find the biggest 'unit', while the 'value' is
still above 0.
With the updated version, the algorithm tries to find the 'unit' low
enough, that the resulting 'value' can still fit into the 16-bit space
without overflow.

* [PFCP] Fix calculation of AMBR

correctly represent the NF load
- if anything, we should also check the load of the application pool to
determine correct load of the NF

* [AMF,SMF,PCF] Rename the function for calculating NF Instance load

- have a more consistent naming among the NF's
- always have the same prefix (amf_/smf_/pcf_) depending on the NF
- function name is always the same, how the function calculates the load
is NF specific and internal to the function itself (but not the function
name).

* [SMF] Fix a use-after-free bug

* [SMF] Fix Gx/Gy assert() if more than 64 CCRs are sent

The current code uses the cc request number as an index to the
transaction array (xact/xact_data). Since cc request number is a 32 bit
integer this is unfeasible for longer sessions and if more than a
handful of messages are exchanged per session.

The array size was already increased in [open5gs#2038](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2038) which simply delays the
issue.
Furthermore, the current code asserts that cc_request_number is <=
MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER which leads to an out-of-bounds write if
cc_request_number == MAX_CC_REQUEST_NUMBER.

Instead use a smaller array and index into it using cc_request_number
% array size. More than 2 requests should never be in flight at any one
time (initial or update request together with a termination request) so
an array size of 4 should be fine.

* [SMF] Decrease sessions metric on OLD Session Release

Since [redesign]([open5gs@8553c77](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/8553c77733f50f82bfa6a9a4ee57f7ca0133a815))
of fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr gauge, the metric doesn't
expose some decrements. The decreasing of gauge had been
moved out of function stats_remove_smf_session.

It should be decreased every time stats_remove_smf_session
is called, but this particular case is easily reproducible
by killing UPF while the session is established.

* [AMF] Fix search for correct SMF based on SmfInfo

Each SMF's NfProfile can contain multiple SmfInfo items. The issue was
that AMF checked only the first SmfInfo for correct S-NSSAI/NR-TAI
information.

In case of a 5G core setup with SMF handling 2 or more slices, and UE
trying to establish multiple PDU sessions, AMF would report an error
when trying to find the correct serving SMF.

* mme: Introduce initial Gn iface (GTPv1C) support

This interface allows supporting several inter-RAT mobility features
towards pre-rel8-SGSNs (SGSNs without S3/S4 GTPV2C interface).

* [AMF] Implicit Deregistration (Reset, ConnRefused)

When AMF release the NAS signalling connection,
ran_ue context is removed by ran_ue_remove() and
amf_ue/ran_ue is de-associated by amf_ue_deassociate().

In this case, implicit deregistration is attempted
by the mobile reachable timer according to the standard document,
and amf_ue will be removed by amf_ue_remove().

TS 24.501
5.3.7 Handling of the periodic registration update timer and

Start AMF_TIMER_MOBILE_REACHABLE
mobile reachable timer
The network supervises the periodic registration update procedure
of the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer.
If the UE is not registered for emergency services,
the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than the value of timer
T3512. In this case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is
4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3512.
The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the
value as indicated above, when the AMF releases the NAS signalling
connection for the UE.

* [AMF/MME] Remove code that doesn't work ([open5gs#2013](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/2013))

Based on the standard document below, when the UE is in the IDLE state,
we checked the implicit timer and tried to send a message to the UE,
but it doesn't work properly.

So, first of all, I deleted the related code.

- TS 24.301 Ch 5.3.7
If ISR is not activated, the network behaviour upon expiry of
the mobile reachable timer is network dependent, but typically
the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the
first expiry, and may take other appropriate actions

The network behaviour upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer is network dependent,
but typically the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the first expiry,
and may take other appropriate actions.

* Use x1000 multiplier for Kbps, Mbps, ... etc. ([open5gs#2515](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/2515))

NAS, GTP, PFCP, SBI, all except S1AP/NGAP use x1000 multiplier for Kbps, Mbps, Gbps ... etc.

From now on in WebUI all units also use a multiplier of x1000.

* [SMF] Added SMF registrations ([open5gs#2514](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2514), [open5gs#2524](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/discussions/2524))

* [TLV] PFCP parser crash from FuzzingLabs ([open5gs#2523](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2523))

* [SBI] nghttp2 SETTING ACK should be sent ([open5gs#2385](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2385))

Whether or not to send a Setting ACK is determined by the nghttp2 library.
Therefore, when nghttp2 informs us that it want to send an SETTING frame
with ACK by nghttp2_session_want_write(), we need to call session_send()
directly to send it.

* [WebUI] Fixed a crash when editing Subscribe

After the UE performs Registration/Attach, SQN field is created.

If we edit subscriber information when SQN value is present, WebUI crash occurs.

It is because the way to handle Long Type(SQN:Long) is different
when the mongoose version is 6 or higher.

To avoid this crash, we use the mongoose version down to 5.x first.

* [SMF] Deregister issue during sess release ([open5gs#2537](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2537))

A situation in which you establish two sessions and release both of them.

In the first SESSION, the UE normally sent PDUSessionResourceReleaseResponse
and PDU session release complete. However, these were not sent when releasing
the second SESSION.

At this point, when the UE tried to do a deregistration,
the SMF was not properly handling the exception.

I've just fixed this.

* [NRF] Fixed NRF crash when Custom nfType ([open5gs#2576](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2576))

* [PFCP] Fixed Possible heap buffer overflow ([open5gs#2585](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2585))

After examining the call stack and reading the source code, I found that
in /lib/core/ogs-pool.h line 152: (pool)->array[i] = i+1;
then in lib/pfcp/context.c line 78: pdr_random_to_index[ogs_pfcp_pdr_teid_pool.array[i]] = i;
ogs_pfcp_pdr_teid_pool.array[i] may exceed the size of pdr_random_to_index, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

* [SMF] Invalid Message(SmContextCreateData) ([open5gs#2590](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2590))

curl --noproxy '*' --http2-prior-knowledge -X POST --header "Content-Type: multipart/related" --data-binary [@pdu](https://github.com/pdu) http:/192.168.29.231:7777/nsmf-pdusession/v1/sm-contexts
Attaching file 'pdu'

SMF crashes as not able to decode the message properly. SmContextCreateData is not accessible.

* [GTPU] Fixed PDCP SN handling ([open5gs#2584](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2584), [open5gs#2477](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/discussions/2477))

Scenario is handover on S1AP, data forwarding is enabled, and
the Source ENB is forwarding DL PDCP packets to EPC(SGWU)
with PDCP SN included. SGWU is also forwarding these packets
to the Target ENB.

However the PDCP SN is not present in the forwarded packets
from SGWU to Target ENB.

I modified this part, and there was the same problem in 5GC, fixed it as well.

A lot of code in GTP-U has been modified,
so if you have any problems, please let us know right away.

* Minor change to address timer warnings and erros in upf, patch for upf bearer removal when sgw restarts
