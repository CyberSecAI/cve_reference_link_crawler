Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint in `index.ts` is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to lack of sanitization of the `fileName` body parameter. No known patches for this issue are available.
