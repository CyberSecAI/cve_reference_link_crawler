- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization in the web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can store malicious content for use in XSS attacks, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must persuade a user to click a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and remote.
