CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. If there were connection issues with the Solr server, the internal Solr URL (potentially including credentials) could be leaked to package_search calls as part of the returned error message. This has been patched in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0.
