Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-45750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the VPN client's acceptance of malformed ECDSA signatures during the IKEv2 authentication phase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of ECDSA signatures.
- Failure to reject malformed signatures, leading to successful authentication with potentially invalid credentials or altered data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to establish a VPN tunnel by providing a malformed ECDSA signature.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the network, man-in-the-middle attacks, data breaches and other impacts due to bypassing intended authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited during the IKEv2 authentication phase, specifically when the VPN client processes ECDSA signatures.
- A malicious actor would need to intercept or manipulate the IKEv2 authentication exchange to inject a malformed signature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept or manipulate network traffic during the IKEv2 authentication process.
- They must have the ability to craft a malformed ECDSA signature and inject it into the authentication exchange.

**Affected Products:**
- Windows Standard VPN Client versions 6.87.108 and older
- Windows Enterprise VPN Client versions 6.87.109 and older
