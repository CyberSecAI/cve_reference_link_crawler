Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Mastodon's failure to compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. This issue leads to incorrect access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect access control due to the lack of compaction of signed JSON-LD activities.
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of signed JSON-LD activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The provided text does not provide any specific impact, however, the vulnerability is classified as having "critical severity", and it is related to access control, so it can be inferred that this could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered through incoming signed JSON-LD activities. An attacker could potentially craft malicious JSON-LD payloads to exploit the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to send crafted, signed JSON-LD activities to a vulnerable Mastodon instance. This implies the attacker needs to be able to interact with the Mastodon instance as a remote user, or be in a position to inject this type of messages.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability affects Mastodon versions prior to 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6.
- The fix involves ensuring the correct compaction of signed JSON-LD activities.
- JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.
