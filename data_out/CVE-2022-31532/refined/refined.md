Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to path traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22) found in multiple GitHub repositories, all stemming from the unsafe use of Flask's `send_file` function:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue across all identified repositories is the insecure use of the `flask.send_file` function. This function, when provided with an attacker-controlled path, can lead to absolute path traversal, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This occurs because `send_file` does not perform adequate sanitization or validation of the provided path, allowing an attacker to provide absolute paths, or paths with directory traversal sequences like `../`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: The primary weakness is that the application does not properly restrict file access to authorized directories. By manipulating the provided path, an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Unsafe Use of `flask.send_file`**: The `send_file` function is used with attacker-controlled paths, which it does not sanitize, leading to path traversal.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation**: The application doesn't validate or sanitize user inputs before passing them to file-handling functions, allowing malicious inputs to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could read sensitive files like source code, configuration files, private keys, or any other file accessible to the webserver's user, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to source code or configuration files could facilitate further attacks on the application.
*   **Loss of Availability:** While less likely, an attacker might be able to cause denial-of-service (DoS) by requesting excessively large or numerous files.
* **Integrity:** Although less prominent in the context of `send_file`, a successful path traversal vulnerability could theoretically allow for manipulation or tampering with data on the server's filesystem, although not within the file served by `send_file`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attacks:** The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests, where the attacker crafts a URL with a manipulated path to exploit the `send_file` function.
*   **Direct Path Manipulation:** Attackers can inject absolute paths or relative paths with directory traversal sequences in the filename or file path parameter, allowing them to traverse up the file system and access restricted resources.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific URLs. For example, `curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/download//../../../../etc/passwd'` can be used to access the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** In most cases, the vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication, as the vulnerable code is exposed through public endpoints.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and how the file path is being constructed to craft an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   All the mentioned vulnerabilities have a high CVSS score of 9.3. However, one entry for `adriankoczuruek/ceneo-web-scrapper` has a score of 9.8, mainly due to a more general impact of confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
*  The identified vulnerabilities were discovered using CodeQL.
* The fixes for these vulnerabilities typically involve using `flask.safe_join` to validate paths or replacing `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory`.
* A common point of discussion among the various advisories is whether or not it makes sense to apply for a CVE on personal, proof-of-concept, or hobby projects, particularly when there is no apparent package manager nor active development.
