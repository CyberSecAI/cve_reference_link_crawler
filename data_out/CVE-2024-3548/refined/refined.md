- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which could be used against high-privilege users such as administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a crafted shortcode to a post, such as `[su_lightbox src='123"onmouseover="alert(1)"']Click here to open lightbox[/su_lightbox]`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a contributor or higher level user to add a malicious shortcode to a post.
