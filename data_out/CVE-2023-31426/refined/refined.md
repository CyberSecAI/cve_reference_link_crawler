Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-31426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Brocade Fabric OS commands `configupload` and `configdownload` were printing scp, sftp, and ftp server passwords in the `supportsave` output. This exposed sensitive credentials within the system logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Passwords for remote servers (scp, sftp, ftp) were being included in the `supportsave` logs in plaintext, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Insecure Logging:**  Sensitive authentication information was being logged, violating the principle of least privilege and best security practices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker with valid authentication to the Brocade Fabric OS could potentially gain access to plaintext passwords for remote servers used for configuration uploads and downloads.
- **Lateral Movement/Further Compromise:** With the disclosed credentials, an attacker could potentially gain access to other systems within the network (scp, sftp, or ftp servers) leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Brocade Fabric OS device.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to login to the Brocade Fabric OS.
- **Command Execution:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute the `configupload` or `configdownload` commands to trigger the generation of a `supportsave` with the exposed passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to reach the Brocade Fabric OS device over the network.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Brocade Fabric OS device.
- **Command Execution Rights:**  The attacker must have sufficient privileges on the device to execute the `configupload` or `configdownload` commands.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal penetration testing.
- The issue was addressed in Brocade Fabric OS versions v9.1.1c, v8.2.3d, and v9.2.0.
- The CVSS score from the Broadcom advisory is 6.8 while the one provided by NetApp is 6.5. It is due to the UI requirement in the CVSS vector from the Broadcom advisory.
