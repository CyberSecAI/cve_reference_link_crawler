{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Quarkus handles authorization when JAX-RS endpoints have methods declared in abstract classes or when these methods are customized by Quarkus extensions using annotation processors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authorization bypass vulnerability due to improper enforcement of security policies when using specific configurations.",
        "Improper handling of JAX-RS endpoint methods declared in abstract Java classes.",
        "Inadequate security checks on methods customized via annotation processing."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to an authorization bypass, potentially allowing unauthorized access to JAX-RS endpoints, if the user has enabled authorization through 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints' or 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed'.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker would need to send a request to a JAX-RS endpoint whose authorization is not correctly enforced.",
        "The endpoint must have its methods declared in an abstract Java class, or these methods must be customized via annotation processing."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable JAX-RS endpoints. No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to reach the service.",
      "additional_details": "This issue affects both RestEasy Reactive and Classic implementations in Quarkus. The vulnerability is triggered when specific security configurations ('quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints' or 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed') are enabled in conjunction with JAX-RS methods defined within abstract classes or customized using annotation processors."
