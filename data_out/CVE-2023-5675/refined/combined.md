| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2245197#c0)  Vipul Nair    2023-10-20 04:37:29 UTC  ``` When a RestEasy Reactive JAX-RS endpoint has its methods with HTTP method annotations declared in the abstract Java class or when its methods without HTTP method annotations are customised by Quarkus extensions to handle JAX-RS GET requests using the annotation processor, then the authorization of these methods will not be enforced if it is enabled by either 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints' or 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed' properties  So a combination of 2 factors triggers it:  * Users enable the security authorization of JAX-RS endpoints with either 'quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints' or `quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed` properties * Users declare JAX-RS methods which must be secured with these properties in the Java abstract class which the JAX-RS endpoint class will extend   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2245197#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-01-25 13:51:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.13.9.SP1  Via RHSA-2024:0494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0494)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2245197#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-01-25 13:52:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.9.SP1  Via RHSA-2024:0495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0495)   ``` |  |
