Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0588:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the LibreNMS application. Specifically, users with a normal role/level were able to access and view the alert transport details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The core issue is that the application exposes sensitive alert transport information to unauthorized users. This information could include credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data necessary for sending alerts.
*   **Improper Authorization:** Normal users were granted access to information they should not have had access to. This indicates a flaw in the authorization logic of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could view sensitive alert transport details, potentially allowing them to gain access to other systems or services using these details.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The exposed information could potentially be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities or attacks to compromise the system further.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** The sensitive information about alert transport mechanisms can be exposed to individuals who do not have the authorization to view it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, as an attacker with a normal user account can access the information through the web interface.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the normal role/level to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account with "normal" privileges within the LibreNMS application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the LibreNMS web interface.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-0588 is an **Information Disclosure** vulnerability in LibreNMS that allows a normal authenticated user to view sensitive alert transport details, which is only supposed to be accessible by administrators. This vulnerability exists due to the application's failure to properly enforce access controls.
