**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is "insufficient input sanitization and output escaping" within the Image Grid widget of the "HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor" plugin.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the database which will be executed later in a user's browser when that user visits the affected page.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker (with contributor access or higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts into WordPress pages. These scripts can be used for a wide variety of malicious purposes such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing cookies or session data, modifying page content, or performing administrative actions.

   - **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Image Grid widget. Specifically, by supplying malicious JavaScript code through the attributes of this widget that are not properly sanitized.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated with at least "contributor" level access to WordPress. This position allows them to create or modify page content.
