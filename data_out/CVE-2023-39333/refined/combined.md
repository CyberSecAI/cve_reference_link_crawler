# Friday October 13 2023 Security Releases

Friday October 13 2023 Security Releases
## [*(Update 13-October-2023)* Security releases available](#update-13-october-2023-security-releases-available)

Updates are now available for the v18.x and v20.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## [undici - Cookie headers are not cleared in cross-domain redirect in undici-fetch (Low) - (CVE-2023-45143)](#undici---cookie-headers-are-not-cleared-in-cross-domain-redirect-in-undici-fetch-low---cve-2023-45143)

Undici did not always clear Cookie headers on cross-origin redirects. By design, cookie headers are [forbidden request headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-request-header), disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch.

As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the 3rd party site.

More details area available in [GHSA-wqq4-5wpv-mx2g](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-wqq4-5wpv-mx2g)

## [nghttp2 - HTTP/2 Rapid Reset (High) - (CVE-2023-44487)](#nghttp2---http2-rapid-reset-high---cve-2023-44487)

Rapidly creating and cancelling streams (`HEADERS` frame immediately followed by `RST_STREAM`) without bound causes denial of service.
See <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487> for details.

Impacts:

* This vulnerability affects all users of HTTP/2 servers in all active
  release lines 18.x and 20.x.

## [Permission model improperly protects against path traversal (High) - (CVE-2023-39331)](#permission-model-improperly-protects-against-path-traversal-high---cve-2023-39331)

A previously disclosed vulnerability (CVE-2023-30584) was patched insufficiently.
The new path traversal vulnerability arises because the implementation does not protect itself against the application
overwriting built-in utility functions with user-defined implementations.

Impacts:

* This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.x.

Please note that at the time this CVE is issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Thanks to [Tobias Nießen](https://github.com/tniessen) who reported and created
the security patch.

## [Path traversal through path stored in Uint8Array (High) - (CVE-2023-39332)](#path-traversal-through-path-stored-in-uint8array-high---cve-2023-39332)

Various `node:fs` functions allow specifying paths as either strings or `Uint8Array` objects.
In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class extends the `Uint8Array` class.
Node.js prevents path traversal through strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004),
but not through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.

This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 ([report 2038134](https://hackerone.com/reports/2038134)),
which only referred to `Buffer` objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`.

Impacts:

* This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.x.

Please note that at the time this CVE is issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Thanks to [Tobias Nießen](https://github.com/tniessen) who reported and created
the security patch.

## [Integrity checks according to policies can be circumvented (Medium) - (CVE-2023-38552)](#integrity-checks-according-to-policies-can-be-circumvented-medium---cve-2023-38552)

When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest,
the application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to node's policy implementation,
thus effectively disabling the integrity check.

Impacts:

* This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 18.x and, 20.x.

Please note that at the time this CVE is issued, the policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Thanks to [Tobias Nießen](https://github.com/tniessen) who reported and created
the security patch.

## [Code injection via WebAssembly export names (Low) - (CVE-2023-39333)](#code-injection-via-webassembly-export-names-low---cve-2023-39333)

Maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module can inject JavaScript code.
The injected code may be able to access data and functions that the WebAssembly module itself does not have access to,
similar to as if the WebAssembly module was a JavaScript module.

Impacts:

* This vulnerability affects users of the `--experimental-wasm-modules` command line option in all active release lines 18.x and 20.x.

Thanks to dittyroma for reporting the issue and to [Tobias Nießen](https://github.com/tniessen) for fixing it.
