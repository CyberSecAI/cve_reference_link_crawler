- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the misuse of ESET's file operations during a restore from quarantine. An attacker can plant malicious files in specific folders. When a user with administrative privileges initiates a restore, ESET's service is tricked into creating or overwriting arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue stemming from insecure file handling during quarantine restore operations. Specifically, the lack of proper validation and sanitization of paths when restoring files from quarantine allows for arbitrary file creation and overwriting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to achieve arbitrary file creation and overwrite, resulting in a local privilege escalation. This could enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have local access to the system and be able to plant files in specific locations. The attack relies on a privileged user initiating a quarantine restore operation that involves the attacker-controlled files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system. They must also have the capability to place malicious files in specific folders and then convince a user with administrative privileges to initiate a restore from the quarantine.
