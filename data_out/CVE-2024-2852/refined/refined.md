Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `saveParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda AC15 router firmware. This function receives a user-provided `urls` parameter, and passes this variable to a function without any length validation, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking on the input `urls` parameter before copying it into a stack buffer within the `saveParentControlInfo` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a large payload that overflows the stack buffer, potentially crashing the router.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With carefully crafted overflow data, it's possible for an attacker to overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a malicious HTTP POST request sent to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- **`urls` Parameter:** The attacker controls the content of the `urls` parameter within the POST request to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target router or have access to the router's web interface through an exposed port or vulnerability.
- **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and have a method to generate and send malicious HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides specific details such as the affected firmware version (AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi) and includes a proof-of-concept (POC) python script.
