- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When the uncore PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) fails to register, the PMU context might not be allocated. However, the error handling code calls `cpuhp_state_remove_instance()`, which triggers the uncore PMU offline callback. This callback attempts to migrate the PMU context, leading to a use-after-free condition because the context may not have been properly initialized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper error handling when PMU registration fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a failure to register the uncore PMU. This could be caused by a variety of issues, such as resource exhaustion, permission problems, or incorrect configuration. The specific steps to trigger this failure would vary depending on the environment and system configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position where they can cause the uncore PMU registration to fail.

The provided patches replace `cpuhp_state_remove_instance()` with `cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls()` in the error handling paths for the HiSilicon PA and SLLC PMUs. This prevents the offline callbacks from being executed after the PMU device fails to register, thus avoiding the use-after-free condition.
