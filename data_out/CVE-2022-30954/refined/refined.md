Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-30954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Blue Ocean Plugin does not perform permission checks on several HTTP endpoints. Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing permission checks:** Several HTTP endpoints in the Blue Ocean plugin lack proper permission checks.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The affected endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can send requests to an attacker-specified URL. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger actions on behalf of a victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests to specific endpoints within the Blue Ocean plugin. Attackers can exploit this remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   The attacker must craft a malicious HTTP request to exploit the lack of permission checks.
*   To exploit the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to induce a victim user to interact with the crafted request (e.g., by tricking them into clicking on a link).

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Blue Ocean Plugin versions 1.25.3 and earlier.
*   Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.4 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints, resolving this vulnerability.
*  The specific endpoints are not detailed in the provided text.
