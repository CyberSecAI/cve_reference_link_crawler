- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple instances of Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker injects malicious scripts that are stored on the server and then executed in the browser of a victim user when they access the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the system which then gets stored and executed on the victim's browser when they view the content.
