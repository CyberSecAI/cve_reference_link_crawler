Information Disclosure, Information Tampering and Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities in Multiple Air Conditioning Systems

Release date: June 7, 2022
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

■Overview

  Information disclosure, information tampering and denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in encryption communications on
Mitsubishi Electric air conditioning systems. A malicious attacker may disclose some of encrypted message of the air conditioning
systems by sniffing encrypted communications (CVE-2022-24296, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808). Besides,
a man-in-the-middle attacker may tamper the message and cause a DoS condition on the air conditioning systems (CVE-2009-
3555).
  Mitsubishi Electric air conditioning systems are premised that they are used in intra networks, secure environments with VPN
routers, etc. such as System Example 1 or 2 in section "Description". Please make sure that your system is properly configured
as recommended by Mitsubishi Electric.

■Description

Information  disclosure  vulnerabilities  (CVE-2022-24296,  CVE-2016-2183,  CVE-2013-2566  and  CVE-2015-2808),  and
information  tampering  and  denial  of  service  (DoS)  vulnerability  (CVE-2009-3555)  exist  in  encryption  communications  on
Mitsubishi Electric air conditioning systems.
・CVE-2022-24296: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)
・CVE-2016-2183: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)
・CVE-2013-2566: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm（CWE-327）
・CVE-2015-2808: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm（CWE-327）
・CVE-2009-3555: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint（CWE-300）

In case of System Example 1 and 2, even if an attacker tries to exploit the vulnerabilities from the Internet, the attack will not
succeed.
In case of System Example 3, if an attacker tries to exploit the vulnerabilities from the Internet, the attack may succeed. Please
make sure that your system is properly configured as recommended by Mitsubishi Electric.

System Example 1: A configuration using air conditioning systems in intra networks (Figure 4)
