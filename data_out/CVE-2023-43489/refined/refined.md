Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in Intel® Computing Improvement Program (Intel® CIP) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate access controls, which allows a local authenticated user to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the software or system may become unavailable or unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user on the local system. They do not need to be a privileged user based on the CVSS vector.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in Intel® CIP software before version 2.4.10717.
- Intel recommends updating to version 2.4.10717 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 5.5 (Medium) and the CVSS v4.0 base score is 6.8 (Medium).
