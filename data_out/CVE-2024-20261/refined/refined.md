- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error in the file policy feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software when inspecting a specific class of encrypted archive files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284) leading to a file policy bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured file policies designed to block encrypted archive files. This allows the attacker to send malicious encrypted archive files through the affected device, potentially introducing malware that should have been blocked.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted, encrypted archive file through the affected Cisco FTD device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the FTD device, but does not need authentication or special privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
