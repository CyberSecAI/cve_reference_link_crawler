# Buffer overflow in usb device class

High

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-fm6v-8625-99jf
Feb 7, 2022

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

v2.6.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

I believe that the Bluetooth usb device class provided with Zephyr is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

When a control transfer is handled by bluetooth\_class\_handler (subsys/usb/class/bluetooth.c) a bluetooth tx buffer is first acquired, populated with contents of data buffer and when this operation is successful the buffer is pushed to rx\_queue.

```
static int bluetooth_class_handler(struct usb_setup_packet *setup,

                                 int32_t *len, uint8_t **data)

{

        struct net_buf *buf;

        LOG_DBG("len %u", *len);

        buf = bt_buf_get_tx(BT_BUF_CMD, K_NO_WAIT, *data, *len);

        if (!buf) {

               LOG_ERR("Cannot get free buffer\n");

               return -ENOMEM;

        }

        net_buf_put(&rx_queue, buf);

        return 0;

}

```

Following the execution flow of bt\_buf\_get\_tx (subsys/bluetooth/host/hci\_raw.c) one may observe few significant steps – buffer allocation, reservation, type set and net\_buf\_add\_mem.

```

       buf = net_buf_alloc(pool, timeout);          //SH: allocate BT_HCI_CMD_HDR_SIZE + CONFIG_BT_BUF_CMD_TX_SIZE bytes

       if (!buf) {

              return buf;

       }

       net_buf_reserve(buf, BT_BUF_RESERVE);

       bt_buf_set_type(buf, type);

       if (data && size) {

              net_buf_add_mem(buf, data, size);

       }

       return buf;

```

With pool set to hci\_cmd\_pool and successful allocation, data and size provided in the control transfer request we finally reach `net_buf_add_mem` and `net_buf_simple_add_mem`.

```
static inline void *net_buf_add_mem(struct net_buf *buf, const void *mem,
                                  size_t len)

{

        return net_buf_simple_add_mem(&buf->b, mem, len);

}

void *net_buf_simple_add_mem(struct net_buf_simple *buf, const void *mem,
                                                                 size_t len)

{

                    NET_BUF_SIMPLE_DBG("buf %p len %zu", buf, len);

                    return memcpy(net_buf_simple_add(buf, len), mem, len);     //SH: if buffer is not large enough copy len bytes from mem to buf violating boundaries

}

void *net_buf_simple_add(struct net_buf_simple *buf, size_t len)

{

        uint8_t *tail = net_buf_simple_tail(buf);

        NET_BUF_SIMPLE_DBG("buf %p len %zu", buf, len);

        __ASSERT_NO_MSG(net_buf_simple_tailroom(buf) >= len);             //SH: shouldn’t this case be properly handled?

        buf->len += len;            //SH: does this buffer really have enough space?

        return tail;

}

```

As far as I can understand in case the net\_buf\_simple buffer does not have enough free space the buf->len will still be incremented by len “stretching” the buffer past actual boundaries.

Len bytes of data provided in the control transfer request will be copied to the buffer possibly overwriting memory past the end of buffer.

Depending on memory contents this might lead to malicious modifications of important data structures or execution of arbitrary code. With a “write to device” usb control transfer one may write up to CONFIG\_USB\_REQUEST\_BUFFER\_SIZE bytes of data (i.e. 2048 as in overlay-usb-nrf-br.conf) writing past a CONFIG\_BT\_BUF\_CMD\_TX\_SIZE (i.e. 65 bytes for nrf51\_blenano.conf) + BT\_HCI\_CMD\_HDR\_SIZE (3 bytes) buffer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
