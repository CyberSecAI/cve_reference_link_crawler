  "CVE-2024-3661": {
    "description": "The TunnelVision vulnerability (CVE-2024-3661) allows an attacker on the same local network as a VPN user to bypass the VPN encryption by manipulating DHCP option 121. This forces traffic to be routed outside the VPN tunnel, potentially exposing it to eavesdropping and modification.  It affects operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux that support DHCP option 121. Android is not affected, because it doesn't support DHCP option 121.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how VPN clients prioritize routing rules. By using DHCP option 121, an attacker can create more specific routing rules that take precedence over the VPN's routes, forcing traffic to bypass the encrypted tunnel. This relies on the fact that VPN clients typically use the same routing table as regular, non-VPN traffic.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper prioritization of routing rules.",
        "Lack of separation between VPN and non-VPN traffic routing.",
        "Reliance on a single routing table for both encrypted and unencrypted traffic.",
        "Vulnerable implementation of kill switches which rely on monitoring for connection drops but does not prevent traffic leaking before the drop happens."
      ],
       "impact": "Complete bypass of VPN encryption, allowing the attacker to read, drop or modify unencrypted traffic. This includes metadata such as source and destination addresses and DNS queries. The VPN will appear to be active, and killswitches won't trigger, creating a false sense of security.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Rogue DHCP server on the same local network.",
        "Compromised DHCP server on the same local network.",
        "Evil twin Wi-Fi hotspots.",
        "Compromised wireless access points or routers."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be on the same local network as the victim with the ability to act as a DHCP server."
