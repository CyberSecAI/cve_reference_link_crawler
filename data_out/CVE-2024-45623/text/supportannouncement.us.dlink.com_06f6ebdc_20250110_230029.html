DAP-2310 :: All Hardware Revisions / All Firmware Versions : End-of-Life / End-of-Service : Reported Vulnerabilities

**Publication ID:** SAP10406

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 9 July 2024 9:09 GMT

**Last updated on:** 10 July 2024 4:00 GMT

**Overview**

The DAP-2310 and all hardware revisions have reached their end-of-life ("EOL") /End-of-Service Life ("EOS") Life Cycle. D-Link US recommends retiring and replacing D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS. Please get in touch with your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

As a general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products ceases.  Please read the information and recommendations **below**.

**Vulnerability****:** DAP-2310 Hardware Revision A, Firmware v 1.16RC028, has been accused of having an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability. Below are more details about the vulnerability, and attached is the proof-of-concept, which Dark Wolf Solutions has named BouncyPufferfish.

 **Description****:** BouncyPufferfish exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the ATP binary that handles PHP HTTP requests for the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which runs on the D-Link DAP-2310 Wireless Access Point device. BouncyPufferfish achieves remote code execution by running a crafted curl command that sends an HTTP GET request to the device, triggers the buffer overflow, exercises an ROP chain, and ultimately calls system() to execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Support** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAP-2310 | Worldwide | All Series H/W Revisions | 11/30/2021 | Yes ([Link](https://legacy.us.dlink.com/pages/product.aspx?id=69353d135abc43e1964e8a1191e87a98)) | 07/09/2024 |

**Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to technological evolution, market demands, new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product maturing over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached the End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), it usually does not receive further extended support or development.

Typically, D-Link cannot resolve device or firmware issues for these products since all development and customer support have ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that further use may be risky to connected devices. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please ensure the device has the most recent firmware, frequently updates its unique password to access its web configuration, and always has WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
