Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how TYPO3 CMS handles access control within the backend page tree. Specifically, the system was not correctly restricting the visibility of pages based on user permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Backend users were able to see pages in the backend page tree that they did not have permission to access.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system failed to properly enforce access control rules for the page tree, leading to unauthorized visibility of data.
- The issue occurs when mounts point to restricted pages, or when no mounts are set up but pages grant access to "everybody."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Loss:** Unauthorized users could view the existence and possibly the titles or structure of pages they should not have access to.
- **No Manipulation:**  The vulnerability did not allow unauthorized users to manipulate the content or configurations of the visible pages; the access was limited to viewing the page within the tree.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a backend user.
- **Backend Access:** The attacker must have access to the TYPO3 backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs only low-level backend user privileges.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Backend Access:**  The attacker must be logged into the TYPO3 backend system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The issue is identified as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
- The vulnerability was reported by Peter Schuler and fixed by Oliver Hader, a member of the TYPO3 core & security team.
- Patched versions are 10.4.46, 11.5.40, 12.4.21, and 13.3.1.
