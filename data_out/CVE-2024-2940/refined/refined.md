The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it is related to CVE-2024-2939 and not CVE-2024-2940.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateCourse.php` file of the Online Examination System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to XSS injection. Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable web page. This could allow the attacker to perform various actions, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Displaying unwanted content on the page.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Downloading malware onto the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateCourse.php` file, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific attacker position or privileges are mentioned. The vulnerability can likely be exploited by any user with network access to the application, likely including authenticated admin users since it's within the /adminpanel directory.
