- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability in the FlyCASS login page, where the username input was directly interpolated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection: Allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code.
    - Lack of Authentication: Once logged in as an admin, there was no further authentication check to add new employees to the airline's KCM and CASS list.
    - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The vulnerability allows unauthorized access and manipulation of KCM and CASS data, including adding new employees and modifying existing user information.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Bypassing airport security: Attackers could add themselves or others as authorized users for KCM, allowing them to skip security screening.
    - Accessing cockpits: Attackers could add themselves or others as authorized users for CASS, potentially granting them access to the cockpits of commercial airliners.
    - Unauthorized data manipulation: Attackers could add, modify, or delete employee records, including photos and personal information.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL injection via the username field on the FlyCASS login page.
    - Exploitation of admin access to add/modify employee data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
    - Ability to access the FlyCASS login page.
    - No prior access to the FlyCASS admin system or user accounts necessary
