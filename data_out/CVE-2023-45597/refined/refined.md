- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, the "export_file" function within the "file_configuration" feature of the web application fails to sanitize data properly when generating CSV files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-1236 "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File". The application allows the injection of arbitrary formulas into generated CSV files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject malicious formulas into a CSV file. When a victim downloads and opens this poisoned CSV file, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine or the leakage of confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must have valid credentials to access the vulnerable "file_configuration" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the web application and able to access the file_configuration functionality, specifically the "export_file" function. The attacker also needs the victim to download and open the manipulated CSV file.
