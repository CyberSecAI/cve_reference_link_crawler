Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6961

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `Referer` header within the WP Meta SEO plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `Referer` header, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when a user accesses a page where the injected script is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts which are then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of websites
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Referer Header:** The attack vector is through the `Referer` HTTP header. An attacker can craft a request with a malicious script in the `Referer` header. When the plugin processes this header without proper sanitization, the malicious script is stored and later executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers. No prior access or privileges are needed.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request with the malicious `Referer` header to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the WP Meta SEO plugin up to and including 4.5.12 are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.5.13 and later.
- The provided patch includes sanitization of the `Referer` header via the `wp_sanitize_redirect` function:
  ```diff
  -       $referer_url = wp_get_raw_referer();
  +       $referer_url = wp_sanitize_redirect(wp_get_raw_referer());
  ```
- The patch also addresses an information exposure issue related to password protected posts by adding checks if the post is password protected before accessing its content.
```diff
+  if ($wp_query->post->post_password && post_password_required()) {
+	return;
+  }
```
