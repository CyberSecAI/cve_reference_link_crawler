Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the `json-embed` format in the `Web::Action` module handles data before embedding it into a web page using the `textout` method. The `to_json()` function was outputting raw characters, and these characters were not properly encoded before being embedded in a `<script>` tag. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/Javascript code via data fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the potential for XSS. By embedding unescaped data within a `<script>` tag, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user visits the page. Specifically, the presence of  `</script>` within a data field could close the outer script tag prematurely, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary code.
*   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The code lacked proper encoding of special characters like `<` and `>` within the JSON output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the webpage
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Data Input:** An attacker could craft malicious data containing characters like `<` and `>` or the sequence `</script>` within data fields that are to be output as `json-embed` by the `Web::Action` module. This malicious data could be introduced through various means depending on the application logic.
*   **`json-embed` format:** The specific attack vector depends on the application using the `Web::Action` module and utilizing the `json-embed` format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject data:** An attacker needs to be able to inject data into the application that is then used by `Web::Action` and rendered on the webpage using `json-embed`. This could be via a form input, database entry, or any other means of data input the application handles.
*   **Awareness of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the application is using the vulnerable `json-embed` format and is not encoding the data properly.

**Mitigation:**

The fix in the commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by encoding the `<` and `>` characters within the JSON output using a regular expression substitution: `$json =~ s/([<>])/'\\u' . sprintf('%04x',ord($1))/esg;`. This ensures that these characters are rendered as unicode escapes, preventing them from being interpreted as HTML tags.

The commit also adds a test case to verify this encoding is working correctly.

**Summary:**

The commit addresses an XSS vulnerability in the `Web::Action` module by encoding the characters `<` and `>` before embedding JSON output in a web page. The lack of encoding made it possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary code via specially crafted data fields.

This commit directly addresses the security issue described in the provided content and is likely related to CVE-2020-36827.
