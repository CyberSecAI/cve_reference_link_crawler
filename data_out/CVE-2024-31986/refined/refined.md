{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way XWiki handles document references, specifically when creating a scheduler job. By crafting a malicious document reference, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed when an administrator visits the scheduler page or when the scheduler page is referenced. The injected code is executed due to a lack of proper sanitization of the document reference when the scheduler page is rendered, specifically when action URLs for jobs are generated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This means they can execute arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the entire system, data, and user base.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by creating a document with a specially crafted document reference and an `XWiki.SchedulerJobClass` XObject. The malicious code is triggered when an admin views the scheduler page. This can be done via a direct visit to the page or by referencing the page (e.g., through an image in a comment).",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create documents with edit rights, although they don't need administrative or programming privileges. The malicious code executes in the context of the administrator's session when they access the scheduler page. User interaction (admin visiting a page) is required for the execution of the malicious code."
