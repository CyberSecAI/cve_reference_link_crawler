{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function that could lead to an unprivileged user executing a higher privileged action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Broken Access Control",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user can execute actions that are normally restricted to higher privileged users.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a missing authorization/authentication check, implying that an attacker could directly access the vulnerable function without proper authorization checks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any authentication and can be unauthenticated."
