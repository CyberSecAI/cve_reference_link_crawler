The provided content is a GitHub page displaying a PDF file named "Online Job Finder System - vuln 2.pdf". This file name suggests it contains information about a vulnerability (specifically, the second vulnerability) in an online job finder system. However, the content itself does not provide any details about the vulnerability, such as the root cause, impact, or attack vectors. The PDF itself is not rendered.

Therefore, I cannot extract the requested vulnerability information.
