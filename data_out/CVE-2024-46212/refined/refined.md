Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `addFolderToTar` function in `redaxo/src/addons/backup/lib/backup.php` uses `opendir()` on a directory path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input directory parameter to perform directory traversal.
*   The Cronjobs addon allows administrator to create cronjobs with arbitrary PHP code, without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The backup functionality is vulnerable to directory traversal due to lack of sanitization of the input path. This allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended backup scope.
*   **Unrestricted PHP Code Execution:** The Cronjobs addon allows execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, database dumps, or source code.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code via the Cronjobs addon, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This can be used to obtain a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** An attacker manipulates the `EXPDIR` parameter during backup creation, using path traversal sequences to access files outside of the intended backup directory.
*   **RCE via Cronjobs:** An attacker, with administrator privileges, can create or modify a cronjob to execute malicious PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator in order to access the backup functionality.
*   **RCE:** The attacker needs administrator access to create or modify cronjobs.
