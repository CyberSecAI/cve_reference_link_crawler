Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-4426:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `blog.nintechnet.com` and `www.wordfence.com` explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-4426" as relating to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the "Absolute Reviews" WordPress plugin. The vulnerability arises due to improper nonce verification. The official CVE description is missing, but the provided content is consistent about the nature of the vulnerability.
*   The plugin's source code diff from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows the exact code change that fixed the vulnerability. This also directly confirms that the issue has to do with nonce verification.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **flawed implementation of nonce verification** within the `metabox_review_save()` function of the "Absolute Reviews" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the nonce check was performed using an `if` statement that only checked if the nonce value was set, and *did not* verify it if it was not present.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF. The plugin uses a nonce to verify the origin of requests made to save review metadata. However, the logic used to check the nonce is flawed, allowing attackers to bypass the check.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify review metadata by tricking a logged-in administrator into performing an action that sends a crafted request.  This could include changes to review ratings, titles, or descriptions.
*  **Potential XSS:** As stated in `blog.nintechnet.com`, the impact of this type of CSRF vulnerability may "lead to... XSS (stored or reflected), settings change, configuration import and modification of data in the database." It is unclear if the specific vulnerability in Absolute Reviews led to an XSS, but this risk was present.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request that targets the vulnerable plugin's save functionality, using an improperly formed nonce value.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer a logged-in administrator to initiate the malicious request, typically by tricking them into clicking a link or visiting a website hosting the crafted request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No direct access:** The attacker does *not* need direct access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
*   **Ability to forge requests:** They need to be able to create a malicious HTTP request that targets the vulnerable plugin's save functionality, and host this request, or otherwise get it executed by a logged-in admin.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to deceive a logged-in admin into initiating the forged request.

**7. Specific Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `admin/class-absolute-reviews-admin.php#L645` in the blog post:

    ```php
    if ( isset( $_POST['abr_review_meta'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( wp_unslash( $_POST['abr_review_meta'] ), 'abr_review_meta_nonce' ) ) {
       return;
    }
    ```

    This code snippet checks if `$_POST['abr_review_meta']` is set *before* checking the nonce. If `$_POST['abr_review_meta']` isn't set, the nonce check is skipped entirely and code execution continues.

*   The patched code snippet from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org`
    ```php
       if ( ! isset( $_POST['abr_review_meta_nonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['abr_review_meta_nonce'], 'abr_review_meta_nonce' ) ) { // Input var ok; sanitization ok.
        return;
       }
    ```
    This snippet fixes the issue by checking the nonce value directly, irrespective of other parameters.

**8. Additional Notes:**

*   The blog posts from `blog.nintechnet.com` are part of a series documenting CSRF vulnerabilities discovered across multiple WordPress plugins, highlighting the widespread nature of this issue.
*   The `www.wordfence.com` post provides a concise description of the vulnerability, the CVSS score, and links to relevant references.

**In summary, CVE-2021-4426 is a CSRF vulnerability in the Absolute Reviews WordPress plugin caused by a flawed nonce verification logic. It allows attackers to modify review metadata if they can trick a logged-in administrator into initiating a crafted request.**
