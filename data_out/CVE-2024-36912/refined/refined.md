Based on the provided information, the content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- In Confidential Computing (CoCo) Virtual Machines (VMs), an untrusted host can cause `set_memory_encrypted()` or `set_memory_decrypted()` to fail. This can result in memory being shared while in a decrypted state, potentially leading to security and functional issues. Specifically, if these functions fail, the decrypted memory could be returned to the page allocator, creating a security risk.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to properly handle errors returned by `set_memory_encrypted()` or `set_memory_decrypted()`.
- Potential for decrypted (shared) memory being returned to the page allocator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Decrypted memory could be returned to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security issues due to the shared access to the decrypted data. This could potentially expose sensitive information in the VM's memory to the untrusted host.

**Attack vectors:**
- An untrusted host can manipulate the behavior of `set_memory_encrypted()` and `set_memory_decrypted()` in a way that causes these functions to return an error. This is done during the establishment or teardown of a Guest Physical Address Descriptor List (GPADL).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in the position of the untrusted host controlling the hypervisor, with the ability to influence the execution and outcome of the `set_memory_encrypted()` and `set_memory_decrypted()` operations within the CoCo VM.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a `decrypted` boolean field to the `vmbus_gpadl` struct. This field tracks the decryption status of the buffer associated with the GPADL.
- During the establishment of GPADL via `vmbus_establish_gpadl()`, if `set_memory_decrypted()` fails, `gpadl->decrypted` is set to false.  On success, it's set to true. This prevents the decrypted memory from being returned to the free list and allows the memory to be leaked instead, preventing it from being reused in an unencrypted state.
- Similarly, during teardown of GPADL via `vmbus_teardown_gpadl()`, if `set_memory_encrypted()` fails, and the memory is not encrypted, then `gpadl->decrypted` is set to false to ensure the page will be leaked.
- This ensures that callers of these functions do not return decrypted/shared pages to the memory allocator.

The provided patches from the git commits address the vulnerability by adding this tracking mechanism and changing how memory is handled when encryption or decryption operations fail. This effectively avoids the possibility of shared decrypted memory being returned to the allocator.
