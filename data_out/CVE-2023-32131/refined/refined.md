**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DCM (DICOM) images. Specifically, crafted data within a DCM image can trigger a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious DCM image. The user must either visit a malicious page or open the malicious DCM file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious DCM image containing specific data that will cause an out-of-bounds write during parsing by the Sante DICOM Viewer Pro application. User interaction is required as the target needs to open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage serving the malicious file.
