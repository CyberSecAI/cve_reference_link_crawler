### Summary
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Menu Icons by ThemeIsle WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 0.13.13. This vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'add_mime_type' function, allowing authenticated users with author-level permissions or higher to inject malicious scripts via SVG uploads.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the `_add_mime_type` function not properly sanitizing or escaping input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts through SVG file uploads.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary web scripts into the website.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the content of SVG files, which leads to the execution of injected scripts.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of SVG files, allowing the injected scripts to be executed.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who access the injected page.
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens or credentials which leads to account hijacking.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could alter the visual appearance or content of the site.
- **Malware Distribution:**  An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to distribute malware to site visitors.

### Attack vectors
- **SVG File Upload:** Attackers upload a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious code is stored and executed when other users view content that includes the uploaded SVG.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users with at least "Author" level permissions.
- **File Upload:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files, which is usually granted to users with "Author" or higher privileges.
