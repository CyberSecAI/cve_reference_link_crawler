| Thank you for the super fast responses for the previous bugs, we found new bug in the core module. Summary  * **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 * **version**: micropython [a00c9d5](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/commit/a00c9d56db775ee5fc14c2db60eb07bab8e872dd) * **port**: unix * **contribution**: Junwha Hong and Wonil Jang [@S2-Lab](https://github.com/S2-Lab), UNIST * **description**: Because the length check of int\_to\_bytes does not include 0, it leads to heap-buffer-overflow and Segmentation fault  PoC ``` b = bytes(range(20)) ib = int.from_bytes(b, "big") print(ib.to_bytes( 0, "big")) ```  **Expected behavior in python3**  ``` python3 ./poc_to_bytes Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/fuzzing/output/default/crashes/./poc_to_bytes", line 3, in <module>     print(ib.to_bytes( 0, "big")) OverflowError: int too big to convert ```  **micropython**  ``` Segmentation fault ``` Problem Statement For the PoC, at `py/objint.c:423`, the `len` is 0, thus it pass through `if (len < 0)`  ``` STATIC mp_obj_t int_to_bytes(size_t n_args, const mp_obj_t *args) {     // TODO: Support signed param (assumes signed=False)     (void)n_args;      mp_int_t len = mp_obj_get_int(args[1]);     if (len < 0) {         mp_raise_ValueError(NULL);     }     bool big_endian = args[2] != MP_OBJ_NEW_QSTR(MP_QSTR_little);      vstr_t vstr;     vstr_init_len(&vstr, len);     byte *data = (byte *)vstr.buf;     memset(data, 0, len);      #if MICROPY_LONGINT_IMPL != MICROPY_LONGINT_IMPL_NONE     if (!mp_obj_is_small_int(args[0])) {         mp_obj_int_to_bytes_impl(args[0], big_endian, len, data); ```  Then, it calls `mpz_as_bytes` at with zero `len`. here, thus `b` and `buf` are same before the for loop.  ``` void mpz_as_bytes(const mpz_t *z, bool big_endian, size_t len, byte *buf) {     byte *b = buf;     if (big_endian) {         b += len;     }     mpz_dig_t *zdig = z->dig;     int bits = 0;     mpz_dbl_dig_t d = 0;     mpz_dbl_dig_t carry = 1;     for (size_t zlen = z->len; zlen > 0; --zlen) {         bits += DIG_SIZE;         d = (d << DIG_SIZE) | *zdig++;         for (; bits >= 8; bits -= 8, d >>= 8) {             mpz_dig_t val = d;             if (z->neg) {                 val = (~val & 0xff) + carry;                 carry = val >> 8;             }             if (big_endian) {                 *--b = val;                 if (b == buf) {                     return;                 }             } else {                 ...             }         }     }      // fill remainder of buf with zero/sign extension of the integer     if (big_endian) {         len = b - buf;     } else {         ...     }     memset(buf, z->neg ? 0xff : 0x00, len); ```  Because it never satisfy the condition `if (b == buf)`, the b overflows to the left object. (under the start of the pointer).  Additionally, the length is `-20`, because unexpectedly the condition `b < buf` was satisfied. Patch Patch is very simple. we just need to include 0 to the case.  ``` STATIC mp_obj_t int_to_bytes(size_t n_args, const mp_obj_t *args) {     // TODO: Support signed param (assumes signed=False)     (void)n_args;      mp_int_t len = mp_obj_get_int(args[1]);     if (len <= 0) {         mp_raise_ValueError(NULL);     }     bool big_endian = args[2] != MP_OBJ_NEW_QSTR(MP_QSTR_little);      vstr_t vstr;     vstr_init_len(&vstr, len);     byte *data = (byte *)vstr.buf;     memset(data, 0, len);      #if MICROPY_LONGINT_IMPL != MICROPY_LONGINT_IMPL_NONE     if (!mp_obj_is_small_int(args[0])) {         **mp_obj_int_to_bytes_impl(args[0], big_endian, len, data);** ``` Crash log ``` #0 0x5555556ae6e0 in mpz_as_bytes /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/mpz.c:1611:22 #1 0x55555574583a in int_to_bytes /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objint.c:440:9 #2 0x555555782c1c in mp_execute_bytecode /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/vm.c:1042:21 #3 0x55555574261b in fun_bc_call /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objfun.c:273:42 #4 0x555555903f3d in execute_from_lexer /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:161:13 ****#5 0x555555902ad5 in do_file /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:310:12 #6 0x555555902ad5 in main_ /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:722:19 #7 0x7ffff7c29d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16 #8 0x7ffff7c29e3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3 #9 0x555555593a34 in _start (/home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/build-standard/micropython+0x3fa34) ```  ***Thank you for taking the time to review our bug report! :)*** |

| And I also observed that the behavior of ib.to\_bytes(1, "big") is also different from python3. did you intend it? |

Requires changes for small ints, MPZ large ints, and \"long long\" large
ints.

Adds a new set of unit tests for ints between 32 and 64 bits to increase
coverage of \"long long\" large ints, which are otherwise untested.

Tested on unix port (64 bit small ints, MPZ long ints) and Zephyr STM32WB
board (32 bit small ints, long long large ints).

Untested on a port whose native format is big endian (don't have one at
hand).

This work was funded through GitHub Sponsors.

* No longer overflows if byte size is 0 (closes #13041)
* Raises OverflowError in any case where number won't fit into byte length
  (Now matches CPython, previously MicroPython would return a truncated
  bytes object.)
* Document that micropython int.to_bytes() doesn't implement the optional
  signed kwarg, but will behave as if signed=True when the integer is
  negative (this is the current behaviour). Add tests for this also.

Requires changes for small ints, MPZ large ints, and \"long long\" large
ints.

Adds a new set of unit tests for ints between 32 and 64 bits to increase
coverage of \"long long\" large ints, which are otherwise untested.

Tested on unix port (64 bit small ints, MPZ long ints) and Zephyr STM32WB
board (32 bit small ints, long long large ints).

Untested on a port whose native format is big endian (don't have one at
hand).

`[py/objint: Fix int.to_bytes() buffer size checks.](/winter-special-projects/micropython/commit/0df0289a9043951e67cad65317a849588e90a8a2 "py/objint: Fix int.to_bytes() buffer size checks.

Fixes and improvements to `int.to_bytes()` are:
- No longer overflows if byte size is 0 (closes #13041).
- Raises OverflowError in any case where number won't fit into byte length
  (now matches CPython, previously MicroPython would return a truncated
  bytes object).
- Document that `micropython int.to_bytes()` doesn't implement the optional
  signed kwarg, but will behave as if `signed=True` when the integer is
  negative (this is the current behaviour).  Add tests for this also.

Requires changes for small ints, MPZ large ints, and \"long long\" large
ints.

Adds a new set of unit tests for ints between 32 and 64 bits to increase
coverage of \"long long\" large ints, which are otherwise untested.

Tested on unix port (64 bit small ints, MPZ long ints) and Zephyr STM32WB
board (32 bit small ints, long long large ints).

This work was funded through GitHub Sponsors.
