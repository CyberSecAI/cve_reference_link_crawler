Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47197.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the mlx5 driver when destroying a completion queue (CQ). If `mlx5_core_destroy_cq()` fails, it may still proceed with subsequent destroy operations. Subsequently, `mlx5_core_destroy_cq()` can be invoked again, leading to multiple calls to `mlx5_debug_cq_remove()`. The `cq->dbg` pointer was not being nullified after removal in `mlx5_debug_cq_remove()`, leading to a use-after-free condition when the function is called again on the same cq object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The `cq->dbg` pointer is not nullified after being freed in `mlx5_debug_cq_remove()`.
- Race condition: Multiple calls to `mlx5_debug_cq_remove()` can occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The use-after-free can cause a general protection fault, leading to a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a user-space application through the `mlx5_core_destroy_cq()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the mlx5 driver and trigger the CQ destruction multiple times, such that the first call fails. This can be achieved by a user with sufficient privileges to interact with the mlx5 driver via ioctl calls.
