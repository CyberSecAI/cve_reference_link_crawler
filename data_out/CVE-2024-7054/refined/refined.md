Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7054

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress Popup Maker Plugin (<= 1.19.0)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `close_text` parameter within the Popup Maker plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the "close button text" field when rendering it in the popup close button, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means the malicious script is saved within the plugin's settings and is executed when a user views a page containing a popup.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user input for the `close_text` parameter before storing it in the database.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to escape the stored `close_text` value when rendering it in the HTML of the popup close button.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `close_text` field. This script will then execute in the context of the user's browser whenever the affected popup is displayed.
- **Account Takeover:** Depending on the injected script, attackers could potentially steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
- **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts could be used to alter the appearance or functionality of the website, potentially leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'close_text' parameter in the popup theme settings.
- **Network:** The attack can be conducted remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This means they need a valid account on the affected WordPress site with the ability to edit plugin settings, or at minimum create/edit popups.
- **No User Interaction:** The XSS vulnerability is stored, so it does not require user interaction once the malicious script is injected. It will execute automatically when a user views a page containing a popup with the manipulated close text.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes the code changes introduced in version 1.19.1 to fix this vulnerability.
- The fix includes escaping HTML entities in the close button text and sanitizing input to prevent script injection.
- The vulnerable parameter is `close_text`.
