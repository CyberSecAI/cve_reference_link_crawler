Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6068

**Root Cause:** Improper access control in the MultiAccess FPGA software on Arista 7130 Series platforms when running MOS. Specifically, when ACLs are applied, the filtering logic can get stuck and apply the decision from the previous packet to the current one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect ACL Application:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that after applying an ACL, the system might incorrectly apply the filter decision from the last processed packet to the new packet instead of correctly evaluating each packet based on the defined ACL rules.
*   **Stuck State:** Once triggered, the filtering logic becomes stuck in the incorrect state until the FPGA is reloaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassed ACLs:** Packets that should be blocked by an ACL might be incorrectly permitted to pass through.
*   **Denial of Service (potential):** Packets that should be permitted may be blocked causing a denial of service to the intended traffic flow.
*   **Incorrect Traffic Handling:** The overall impact is that traffic might not be handled as intended based on the configured ACLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through network traffic passing through an affected Arista 7130 Series device.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when applying Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker would need only low privileges on the device to apply and modify access lists.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the affected device with ability to send and manipulate network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue is specific to Arista 7130 Series FPGA platforms running MOS with MultiAccess FPGA software versions 1.7.1 or 1.6.x.
*   The vulnerability is not detectable at the command line and is not visible in any counter state.
*   The issue was discovered internally and there is no evidence of exploitation in the field.
*   The identified Common Weakness Enumeration is CWE-283 Improper Access Control.
*   The CVSSv3.1 score for the vulnerability is 3.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply only one ACL per port after the MultiAccess image is loaded.
*   If a new ACL needs to be applied, reload the FPGA after applying the new ACL.

**Resolution:**
*   Upgrade to MultiAccess FPGA version 1.8.0 or later.
