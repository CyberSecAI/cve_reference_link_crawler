### Description

The Thank You Page Customizer for WooCommerce – Increase Your Sales plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized execution of shortcodes due to a missing capability check on the get\_text\_editor\_content() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
