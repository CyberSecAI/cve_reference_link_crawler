Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1687

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `get_text_editor_content()` function within the "Thank You Page Customizer for WooCommerce" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a capability check in the `get_text_editor_content()` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with subscriber-level access, to call this function.
- **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The `get_text_editor_content()` function processes and executes shortcodes provided by the user. Because there's no authorization check, any authenticated user can inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious shortcodes, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers may be able to modify data or content within the WordPress site by executing specific shortcodes.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker can execute shortcodes that interact with other plugins or WordPress features, it might lead to privilege escalation or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is executed via HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin's AJAX endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site (at least subscriber role).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted POST requests to the site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.2.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 by adding a capability check for `manage_options` before allowing access to the `get_text_editor_content()` function.
*   The function `get_text_editor_content()` is called via AJAX.
*   The fix also added a nonce check in `js/customize-preview.js`.
