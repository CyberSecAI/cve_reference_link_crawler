WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block both incoming and outgoing connections between the system and the Internet

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Operation Scheduler is a tool that enables security operators to intelligently perform routine tasks. It can
be used to schedule maintenance tasks.

SINEC NMS is a new generation of the Network Management System (NMS) for the Digital Enterprise.
This system can be used to centrally monitor, manage, and conﬁgure networks.

SiPass integrated is a powerful and extremely ﬂexible access control system.

Siveillance Identity is an intuitive web-based self-service portal that offers in-house access request
management across multiple sites.

SIMATIC Speech Assistant for Machines (SAM) is a voice assistant that allows users to communicate
directly with their machines through verbal communication.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-22965

A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code
execution (RCE) via data binding. The speciﬁc exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a
WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is
not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may
be other ways to exploit it.
