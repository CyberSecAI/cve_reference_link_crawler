### Description

The Chat Bubble – Floating Chat with Contact Chat Icons, Messages, Telegram, Email, SMS, Call me back plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

Plugin này rất hay, tuy nhiên theo mình còn thiếu 2 option quan trọng:
1. Show Chat Bubble on mobile devices ?
2. Set position of Chat Bubble on mobile devices and desktop devices (Margin left, right, top, bottom)
Nếu bạn bổ sung thêm 2 option này thì plugin hoàn hảo. Mong tin bạn !

Plugin ổn nhưng nên có thêm 1 số tính năng:
1. Item có thể tái sử dụng nhiều lần. Ví dụ cần hiển thị từ 2 số đt trở lên
2. Nên cho custom icon. Link tùy chọn hiện 3 cái dấu www trông rất chán
3. Greeting message hình như còn lỗi (hoặc do xung đột gì đó)
