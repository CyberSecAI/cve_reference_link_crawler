- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Master Popups plugin for WordPress, versions 1.0.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts, specifically through a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads into the website. This would then be executed when a user visits the site, potentially leading to data theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other unauthorized actions within a user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts, likely via a crafted URL or input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a vulnerable input of the plugin. An "Editor" role in the WordPress system is required, but this may also be achievable without this role if there is no required validation of the parameters.
