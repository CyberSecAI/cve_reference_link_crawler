Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the DethemeKit For Elementor plugin's widgets. Specifically, the `hover_animation` attribute, supplied by users, was not being properly sanitized before being included in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are injected and stored in the database, then executed in the browsers of other users visiting affected pages.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in HTML output.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin did not properly encode or escape user-supplied data in HTML, which allowed for malicious script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into pages. This can be used for a variety of malicious activities such as:
    - **Data Theft:** Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - **Website Defacement:** Modifying the website's content.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative access if a privileged user views the injected page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Widgets:** The vulnerability is located in multiple widgets of the DethemeKit For Elementor plugin.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via the `hover_animation` attribute of these widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access. This is because Contributors have the capability to add content to a page through the Elementor editor, allowing them to inject malicious code via plugin's widgets.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code was located in the following files:
    - `widgets/de-post-author.php`
    - `widgets/de-post-date.php`
    - `widgets/de-post-excerpt.php`
    - `widgets/de-post-featured-image.php`
    - `widgets/de-post-terms.php`
    - `widgets/de-post-title.php`
- The fix involved using `sanitize_html_class()` function to sanitize the `animation_class` variable before outputting it in HTML.
