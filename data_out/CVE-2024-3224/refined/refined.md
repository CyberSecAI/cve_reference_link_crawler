Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3224:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `task-details.php` file of the SourceCodester PHP Task Management System version 1.0. This vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `task_id` parameter. The application constructs an SQL query using user-supplied input for `task_id` without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or proper neutralization of user-provided input in the `task_id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user input, which allows malicious SQL code to be embedded in the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Availability:** The database could be made unavailable via denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or by corrupting data needed for normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `task_id` parameter in the HTTP request to `task-details.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `task_id` parameter in `task-details.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:**  The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to construct malicious queries.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information suggests that no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available.
- The vulnerability can be identified by searching for `inurl:task-details.php` using Google Hacking.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-3224 and VDB-259069.
- MITRE ATT&CK technique T1505 is related to this vulnerability.
