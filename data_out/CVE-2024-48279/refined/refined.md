Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** HTML Injection

**Root Cause:** The `/search-result.php` page of the PHPGurukul User Registration & Login and User Management System V3.2 does not properly sanitize user input from the `searchkey` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `searchkey` parameter.
- Allowing arbitrary HTML code to be rendered in the application's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML code into the application's web page. This can be used for various malicious activities such as:
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Phishing attacks by displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if JavaScript code is included in the injected HTML.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a POST request to `/search-result.php`.
- The `searchkey` parameter in the POST request is set to malicious HTML code, such as `<h1>HTML Injection </h1>` as shown in the example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/search-result.php` page with the malicious payload.
- They need to know that the `searchkey` parameter is vulnerable.
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges on the server hosting the application.
