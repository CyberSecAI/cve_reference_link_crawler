- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The firmware for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi in multiple operating systems and some Killer(TM) WiFi in Windows 10 does not properly validate input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via adjacent access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target and does not require authentication or user interaction.
