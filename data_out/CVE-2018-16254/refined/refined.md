The provided content discusses a series of XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16254 to CVE-2018-16259) in the "Import any XML or CSV File" WordPress plugin (also known as WP All Import) but lacks specific technical details about the root cause or how exploitation is achieved. The author of the post mentions that a Proof of Concept (POC) will be disclosed once the vulnerabilities are fixed.

Based on the comment from Peter, a user, the vendor, Soflyy, claims that the reported XSS vulnerability requires an authenticated administrator to intentionally submit the malicious code via a form, implying that it's not a practical threat due to the requirement for admin access and intentional malicious action. The comment states:

**Vulnerabilities:**
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Root Cause:**
- The "custom_type" and "large_feed_limit" parameters (likely used in the import functionality) could be used to inject malicious code. However the technical details about how this is achieved are not present.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious data input through POST parameters in the vulnerable form of WP All Import. Specifically the parameters:
    - "custom_type"
    - "large_feed_limit"

**Impact:**
- Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the vulnerable website.
- This can be leveraged for user compromise, data theft, and further attacks.

**Required Capabilities/Position:**
- The vulnerability is only exploitable by an administrator that is logged in and is able to access the form.
- The vendor claims that this requires the administrator to knowingly enter the malicious code and that this is not a practical vulnerability because of it.

**Additional Notes:**
- There appears to be a disagreement between the security researcher and the plugin vendor regarding the severity of this vulnerability.
- A Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule from Comodo blocked the user's import functionality.
- The user also implies that an attacker could trick a victim into following a link to trigger the vulnerability, however the vendor's comment states that this is not possible.

The provided content gives more context and differing views on the severity than the original CVE description, but no technical details on the vulnerability itself.
