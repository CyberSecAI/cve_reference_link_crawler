| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c0)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-13 13:23:25 UTC  ``` Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that they can be exposed to an attacker having non-privileged access to the server:  * users.digest file contains sha3-512 digest of users in cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 145 Oct 11 09:15 users.digest  * settings.yaml file contains secrets like default password: $1$FqgS9DU1$CkJRB3pwDHhqyuV3woTlN0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5051 Dec 13 12:42 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c1)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-17 09:44:15 UTC  ``` Tracked with CVE-2021-45083 CVSS 8.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)  CRD 2022-02-16 or earlier ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c5)  Thomas Leroy   2022-02-04 10:30:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Enno Gotthold from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c4)) > You are absolutely right. It has always been like this. However some > codestreams only use the client part of Cobbler (Koan) and the server part > is a more recent version. This requires domain knowledge sadly for the > specific products.  Koan is shipped in the following packages: - openSUSE:Factory - SUSE:SLE-15:Update - SUSE:SLE-15:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update  I checked in the sources of these codestreams (all version 3.0.1), and there is no sign of '/etc/cobbler/settings' or 'users.digest' or any variant. So the vulnerable code present in Cobbler is not present is the version of Koan shipped, So Koan is not affected.  However, as you confirmed Enno, Cobbler has always created those files as world readable, so the following codestreams should be affected: - SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update/cobbler	2.2.2-0.68.12.1	 - SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update/cobbler	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-12:Update/cobbler 	2.6.6-49.14.1	 - SUSE:SLE-12:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update/cobbler 	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update:Products:Manager41:Update/cobbler	3.0.0+git20190806.32c4bae0-5.14.1	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP3:Update:Products:Manager42:Update/cobbler	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update:Products:Manager43:Update/cobbler	n/a ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c6)  Thomas Leroy   2022-02-04 10:33:46 UTC  ``` The following openSUSE codestreams should also be affected: - openSUSE:Factory/cobbler - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP3/cobbler - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP4:Update/cobbler ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c13)  Paolo Perego   2022-02-18 10:58:36 UTC  ``` Issue is now public after fixes submission ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c14)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2022-02-18 11:50:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1193671) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/955837> Backports:SLE-15-SP3 / cobbler ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-02-18 14:27:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2022:14891-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata is now available.
