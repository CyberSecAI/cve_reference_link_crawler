Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities affecting cobbler

Hello list,

Last October 2021, I started a review on a subset of the Cobbler
ecosystem  ([1], [2] and [3]) using the master branch at the time the
request was made [4].

During the audit several issues were found and three of them, have been
assigned with a CVE identifier.

1) CVE-2021-45083 - unsafe permissions on sensitive files in /etc/cobbler

It has been found that files in /etc/cobbler are world readable and two
of those files contain sensitive information that can be used by an
attacker to open an authenticated session with cobbler daemon:

     * users.digest file contains sha2-512 digests of users in cobbler
	local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password,
	it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string.
     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 145 Oct 11 09:15 users.digest

     * settings.yaml file contains secrets like hashed default password
	and more.
     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5051 Dec 13 12:42 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml

Assigned CVSS 8.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

This vulnerability affects also koan [5] and products built using
cobbler like SUSE Manager 4.1 and 4.2.
SUSE Manager 4.3 is not affected by this issue.

The issue affects cobbler version 3.3.1 and previous. Version 3.X.X is safe.

Upstream was fixed by this commit:
<https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/34e3417bcbb72d28c3c1c3332af85793ba077f75>

Please note that a possible workaround is trivial. As root you have to
setup the configuration files, to make them readable only by root.

---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<
# chmod go-r /etc/cobbler/users.digest
# chmod go-r /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<

2) CVE-2021-45082 - incomplete template sanitization

In templar.py file, function check_for_invalid_imports, ensures that
Cheetah code is not importing Python modules. However, the control is
very basic and it fires up when line begins with #import:

     lines = data.split("\n")
     for line in lines:
         if line.find("#import") != -1:
             rest = line.replace("#import", "").replace(" ", "").strip()
             if self.settings and rest not in
			self.settings.cheetah_import_whitelist:
                 raise CX("potentially insecure import in template: %s" %
			rest)

However, according to Cheetah documentation [6], it is possible to
include python code using this syntax:

#from MODULE import MODULE_OR_OBJECT [as NAME] [, ...]

Having a rogue module using #from can bypass import sanitization
declared so far.

Assigned CVSS 7.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

This vulnerability affects also products built using cobbler like SUSE
Manager 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Koan is not affected by this issue.

Upstream was fixed by this commit:
<https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/c9a094541d81ce6d753f03888d763ff28b9ada72>

3) CVE-2021-45081: unsafe protocol usage

A lot of cobbler server entry-points are served on HTTP rather then HTTPS.

Assigned CVSS 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

This vulnerability affects also products built using cobbler like koan
and SUSE Manager 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

At the time of disclosing this, there is no a fix available. Using HTTPS
everywhere requires a deep knowledge of how customers implements cobbler
in their network and how do they manage certificates.

Accordingly with the maintainer we will keep attention on this in order
to create a certificate enrolling and trusting layer in the python code
for the future.

CVSS 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

With the author, we agreed that fixing this will take longer, since it
involves
several architectural decision on certifciate enrollment and trust.

4) Hardcoded password for testing

When in /etc/cobbler/modules.conf, in the [authentication] part the
module is “testing”, the credential “testing:testing” is used to
authenticate users.

This is a known and well documented issues.
However the upstream maintainer agreed, that this functionality is no
longer needed and it can safely removed.

5) Log file pollution

In modules/installation/pre_log.py and modules/installation/post_log.py,
some user controlled input strings are appended in
/var/log/cobbler/install.log log file without sanitization.

This can lead to a log pollution attack, where users inject rogue log
statements making hard troubleshooting by sysadmins.

6) Timeline

2021-12-10: vulnerabilities were reported to upstream author
2021-12-16: upstream author acknowledge them and start working on fixes
2021-12-16: received CVEs from Mitre. Offered author an embargo until
             2022-02-16
2022-02-16: we agreed with the author two more embargo day to prepare
	    all fixed packages
2022-02-18: fixes reached upstream repository and findings were public

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c0)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-13 13:23:25 UTC  ``` Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that they can be exposed to an attacker having non-privileged access to the server:  * users.digest file contains sha3-512 digest of users in cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 145 Oct 11 09:15 users.digest  * settings.yaml file contains secrets like default password: $1$FqgS9DU1$CkJRB3pwDHhqyuV3woTlN0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5051 Dec 13 12:42 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c1)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-17 09:44:15 UTC  ``` Tracked with CVE-2021-45083 CVSS 8.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)  CRD 2022-02-16 or earlier ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c5)  Thomas Leroy   2022-02-04 10:30:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Enno Gotthold from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c4)) > You are absolutely right. It has always been like this. However some > codestreams only use the client part of Cobbler (Koan) and the server part > is a more recent version. This requires domain knowledge sadly for the > specific products.  Koan is shipped in the following packages: - openSUSE:Factory - SUSE:SLE-15:Update - SUSE:SLE-15:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update  I checked in the sources of these codestreams (all version 3.0.1), and there is no sign of '/etc/cobbler/settings' or 'users.digest' or any variant. So the vulnerable code present in Cobbler is not present is the version of Koan shipped, So Koan is not affected.  However, as you confirmed Enno, Cobbler has always created those files as world readable, so the following codestreams should be affected: - SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update/cobbler	2.2.2-0.68.12.1	 - SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update/cobbler	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-12:Update/cobbler 	2.6.6-49.14.1	 - SUSE:SLE-12:Update:Products:ManagerToolsBeta:Update/cobbler 	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update:Products:Manager41:Update/cobbler	3.0.0+git20190806.32c4bae0-5.14.1	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP3:Update:Products:Manager42:Update/cobbler	n/a	 - SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update:Products:Manager43:Update/cobbler	n/a ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c6)  Thomas Leroy   2022-02-04 10:33:46 UTC  ``` The following openSUSE codestreams should also be affected: - openSUSE:Factory/cobbler - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP3/cobbler - openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP4:Update/cobbler ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c13)  Paolo Perego   2022-02-18 10:58:36 UTC  ``` Issue is now public after fixes submission ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c14)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2022-02-18 11:50:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1193671) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/955837> Backports:SLE-15-SP3 / cobbler ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1193671#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-02-18 14:27:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2022:14891-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata is now available.

* The initrd is not required anymore as it is an optional file. [#3127](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3127)
* XML-RPC: Added `dump_vars` endpoint. This is intended to replace `get_blended_data` as of 3.4.0. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* XML-RPC: Added `get_item_resolved_value` ([#3056](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3056)) & `set_item_resolved_value` ([#3134](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3134)) endpoints.

* Serial Console options should not contain bogous `-1` value anymore. [#3105](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3105)

* During build the log was not visible due to a custom logger without output. [#3059](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3059)

* `cobbler buildiso`: The `isolinux.cfg` was not properly formatted. [#3047](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3047)
* There were unharmful templating errors in the log related to `redhat_management_type`. The parts depending on this were removed. [#3048](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3048)
* The DNS managers were non-functional before because of a not existing function call. [#3049](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3049)
* `cobbler buildiso` failed with `--tmpdir`s that don't end in `buildiso`. [#3050](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3050)
* `cobbler buildiso` had outdated docs and help messages for some parameters. [#3051](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3051)
* `cobbler import`: It was impossible to import Rocky Linux 8.5 successfully. [#3052](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3052)
* Cobbler created duplicated settings files before. [#3053](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3053)
* `cobbler sync` was broken by refactoring to `shell=False` before. [#3054](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3054)

[Cobbler V3.3.0](/cobbler/cobbler/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

This release got everything! Security, Features, Bugfixes, ...

We have 422 files changed, 25375 insertions(+), 34826 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/10>

Diff to last release: [v3.2.1...v3.3.0](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0)

**Known Issues**:

* `cobbler <item> rename` is not working currently
* `cobbler <item> edit` may have bugs due to the internal refactorings

**Breaking Changes**:

* The webinterface got removed [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2434) [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2286) [#2700](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2700)
  + Please use the CLI in the meantime
  + A new webinterface is under development at <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler-web>
  + The core code has priority at any time. There are third party tools available which provide a webinterface and use

    Cobbler as a backend. A list of those tools can be found at the bottom of the following page: <https://cobbler.github.io/users.html>
* The Cobbler internal TFTP Demon got removed [#2512](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2512)
* `yaboot` support got removed as a bootloader for PowerPC [#2723](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2723)

**Announcements**:

* Important Security Bugfixes [#2794](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2794) [#2795](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795)
  + Arbitrary Read was possible through `generate_script()`
  + Arbitrary Write was possible through `upload_log_data()`
  + Log poisoning with Remote-Code-Execution was possible through any XMLRPC method which logs to the logfile.
* There was an internal refactoring from runtime created Python attributes to Python Properties. This allows much

  better data validation and thus better error handling but also introduced new bugs.

## Package

pip

cobbler
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.3.1

## Patched versions

3.3.1

## Description

An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
