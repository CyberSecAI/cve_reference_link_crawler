Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure default file permissions assigned to sensitive files within the `/etc/cobbler` directory. Specifically, `users.digest` and `settings.yaml` files were world-readable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is that files containing sensitive information were accessible to any local user.
*   **Exposure of Credentials:**
    *   `users.digest` stored SHA2-512 hashes of user passwords. If these passwords were weak, they could be easily cracked.
    *   `settings.yaml` contained sensitive secrets, including a hashed default password and other configuration settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could obtain the hashed passwords from `users.digest` and potentially crack them, gaining unauthorized access to the Cobbler daemon.
*   **Compromise of Secrets:** The attacker could access various secrets present in `settings.yaml` like the default hashed password and potentially use them for further malicious activities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to Cobbler, an attacker could gain control of the network installation server, potentially leading to further system compromise.
*   **Impact on Other Products:** Systems using Cobbler, such as SUSE Manager were also vulnerable, widening the impact of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Non-Privileged User:** An attacker doesn't need root privileges to exploit the vulnerability, any user with local access could read the files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the system where Cobbler is installed.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker would need basic knowledge of Linux file systems and potentially password cracking to make full use of the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.4 with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`, indicating a high severity.
*   **Affected Versions:** Cobbler versions 3.3.1 and earlier are affected.
*   **Fix:** Upstream was fixed by setting appropriate file permissions to be read only by root. The fix can be seen in this commit: `<https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/34e3417bcbb72d28c3c1c3332af85793ba077f75>`.
*   **Workaround:** A workaround involved changing permissions of the vulnerable files to be readable only by root.
*   **Affected Products:** This vulnerability also affects other products that use cobbler, like koan and SUSE Manager (versions 4.1 and 4.2).
