- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache Doris JDBC catalog feature downloads and uses JDBC driver files without proper integrity checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of integrity check on downloaded JDBC driver files allows an attacker to use arbitrary, malicious JAR files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote command execution on the server when the catalog is initialized.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to create a JDBC catalog can specify a malicious JAR file, which will be downloaded and executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs authorization to create a JDBC catalog within the Apache Doris system.
