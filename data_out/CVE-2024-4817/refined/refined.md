Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the `manage_user.php` page of the Campcodes Online Laundry Management System. The application directly uses the `id` parameter from the GET request to fetch user data without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses the user-supplied `id` parameter directly in the SQL query to fetch user information, bypassing any access control mechanisms.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There is no input validation or sanitization on the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to modify it to access any user's information.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:** The application fails to verify if the currently logged-in user is authorized to access the information of the requested user, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to User Data:** Attackers can access sensitive information of other users, such as names, contact details, and other profile data, by simply changing the 'id' parameter in the URL.
- **Potential for further attacks:** The exposure of user information can be a stepping stone for other attacks, like identity theft or social engineering, where the attacker impersonates a legitimate user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of the `manage_user.php` page to access the information of different users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. They should have basic knowledge of web requests and URLs.
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application.
- The attacker does not need any special permissions other than being a standard user. They do not need to be an administrator or privileged user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `manage_user.php` directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the SQL query without proper validation.

```php
if(isset($_GET['id'])){
	$user = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users where id =".$_GET['id']);
	foreach($user->fetch_array() as $k =>$v){
		$meta[$k] = $v;
	}
}
```
- The provided Burp request shows how an attacker can change the `id` to 4 to access user information with ID 4.
- The attacker needs to have an active session (PHPSESSID) which means they need to be logged into the application.
