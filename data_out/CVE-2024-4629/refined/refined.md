Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a race condition in Keycloak's anti-brute force mechanism. The software lacks proper controls to prevent concurrent access to resources that track failed login attempts. This allows multiple login requests from the same user or different users to be processed simultaneously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition where multiple threads process login attempts concurrently. This bypasses the intended rate limiting and lockout mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Synchronization:** The software doesn't synchronize access to the counters that track failed login attempts. This allows attackers to make more attempts than the configured limit.
*   **Session Persistence:** When an account is locked due to too many failed login attempts, the existing sessions are not invalidated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Brute-Force Protection:** Attackers can bypass the configured brute-force protection by sending parallel login requests, effectively allowing more password guesses than intended.
*   **Potential Account Compromise:** This can lead to account compromise as attackers have a greater chance to guess passwords.
*  **Continued Access after Lockout:** Existing user sessions remain valid even after an account is locked out, potentially allowing further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Concurrent Login Requests:** The primary attack vector is sending multiple login requests in rapid succession to exploit the race condition, either by the same attacker or different attackers.
*   **Username and Password Based Login:** This attack is effective on username and password-based logins.
*   **OTP Request:** The race condition is also present in OTP request processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the Keycloak server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Login Process:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the Keycloak login flow to send the parallel requests.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability during login.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Keycloak versions up to and including 22.0.11, 24.0.6, and 25.0.2.
*   The anti-brute force mechanism is not enabled by default in Keycloak.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by HN Security.
*   The fix for this issue was included in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 and Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.12, as well as corresponding container images.
*  The vulnerability is also applicable to "Quick Login Check Milliseconds" functionality
*  The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
