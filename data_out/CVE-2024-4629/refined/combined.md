  + Keycloak <= 24.0.6
  + Keycloak <= 25.0.2

* Advisory URLs:

  <https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2024-09-Keycloak.md>

# Description

Race conditions in the context of web applications, particularly in authentication processes involving user credentials and one-time passwords (OTPs), pose significant security risks.

In a typical authentication scenario, when a user submits their credentials (username and password) through a form, the server validates these credentials before granting access. However, in the presence of race conditions, multiple requests from the same user or different users may arrive at the server simultaneously or in rapid succession.

Keycloak implements an anti-brute force mechanism (which is not enabled by default) which should limit the attack attempts by locking out user accounts after a configured number of incorrect login attempts:

* <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#password-guess-brute-force-attacks>

Based on our analysis, the software does not implement controls to block attacks of this kind; therefore, it's possible to send multiple requests that are processed simultaneously, completely bypassing the anti-brute-force mechanism. Furthermore, when the account is locked, active sessions are not invalidated.

The issue has been verified both on the username and password-based login and on the OTP request. No checks have been performed on the "Quick Login Check Milliseconds" functionality, but we expect it to be affected by the same issue.

The configuration used for testing was set to lockout user accounts after 3 incorrect login attempts.

Further details on the technique used are available here:

### An analysis of the Keycloak authentication system

Earlier this year, I was working with my colleague Ema on a **source-assisted application and architecture assessment** for a client who was using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to implement **single sign-on** on their applications. The purpose of the assessment was not to audit Keycloak itself. However, being it at the core of the authentication system, we took a look at it.

Keycloak is described as a solution for *“Open Source Identity and Access Management. Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort. No need to deal with storing users or authenticating users. Keycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.”*

The relationship between Keycloak and Red Hat is not entirely clear to me, but the former is definitely supported by the latter:

* <https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/getting-started-keycloak-single-sign-operator>
* <https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-build-of-keycloak>

During our analysis we identified some security issues and, therefore, we looked into how to report them to the developers:

![Pasted image 20240820165225.png](https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820165225.png)

Let’s see what vulnerabilities we have discovered and reported.

### OTP bypass

In the [step-up-flow guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#step-up-flow), a mechanism is described for defining different levels of security depending on the level of authentication (LOA), allowing for applications to use a first level (only username + password) or a second level (username + password + OTP). An administrator who follows this guide is led to make the “step-up flow” the default flow for the “browser flow” so that it is used for all applications.

The security issue is caused by the fact that **the default “account” and “account-console” applications are considered as LOA1, therefore access is possible with only a username and a password**, also if all other applications require an OTP (LOA2). **This allows an attacker to completely bypass the OTP request** with only a username and a password, as follows:

1. The attacker tries to access one of the applications configured to login with Keycloak in LOA2.
2. The application redirects to Keycloak for authentication.
3. The attacker provides the correct username and password. At this point, Keycloak requests the OTP.
4. The attacker does not provide the OTP and instead goes to <https://keycloak_url/realms/myrealm/account> (the URL of the “account” default application, which requires username and password). Here the attacker can add a new OTP method without even being asked for a currently configured OTP, even if it’s present.
5. At this point, the attacker can return to the application and will know both the credentials and the OTP, thus being able to access it.

Essentially, **it is possible to completely bypass the second factor of authentication with only a username and a password**.

The communication timeline follows:

28/03/2024 – First communication sent with all details and a proposed fix.

10/04/2024 – Request for a follow-up with additional details about the proposed fix.

17/04/2024 – [Advisory](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4) published.

21/04/2024 – Request of a follow-up.

22/04/2024 – First response: `Apologies for the lack of communication on our side. The discussion moved internally to the Keycloak team as this might be a duplicate of a CVE that was already reported and a fix was implemented and released. You can now find it as CVE-2023-3597 (see https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4).`

Further details are available at:

* <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4>

In hindsight, by analyzing the details available at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2221760>, it is possible to see how **the vulnerability was known to the developers since July 2023 and the fix therefore took 10 months**.

![Pasted image 20240820170144.png](https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820170144.png)

### Multiple security issues in authentication and authorization

Multiple issues have been identified regarding the authentication and authorization of certain endpoints in the Keycloak software.

It has been observed that **certain functionalities within Keycloak, specifically the */metrics* and */health* endpoints, are accessible without proper authentication**. Even though those endpoints do not provide sensitive information, it is preferable that they are accessible only to authenticated individuals with the correct privileges.

Additionally, **users with low privileges could access administrative functionalities in the Keycloak admin interface**. This issue presents a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized users to perform actions reserved for administrators, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. The affected endpoints are:

* /admin/realms/myrealm/client-registration-policy/providers
* /admin/myrealm/console/whoami
* /admin/realms/myrealm/testLDAPConnection

In particular, the last functionality (*testLDAPConnection*), in the event that an AD authentication system has been configured, allows to modify application data, **enabling the submission of an LDAP request (and consequently LDAP access credentials) to a malicious endpoint that can steal the credentials**.

An attacker with access to a non-administrative user account can invoke the “*testLDAPConnection* functionality by modifying the *connectionUrl* parameter with an arbitrary value, and the LDAP credentials will be sent to the attacker-controller server. To successfully execute this attack, it’s also necessary to know the *componentId* related to the domain authentication, which is retrievable in the cookies *KEYCLOAK\_SESSION*, *KEYCLOAK\_SESSION\_LEGACY*, and in the responses returned by the */admin/myrealm/console/whoami* endpoint.

The communication timeline follows:

04/04/2024 – First communication sent with all details.

09/04/2024 – Response with request of clarifications.

09/04/2024 – More details sent.

09/04/2024 – Second reply.

09/04/2024 – [Proposed fix](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/27629) for the first issue.

10/04/2024 – Multiple emails about the first issue.

02/05/2024 – Request for information about the second issue (which is more severe).

09/05/2024 – Response with assigned **CVE-2024-3656** and request not to release any details: `For the moment there is no estimated keycloak version to include the fix`

27/05/2024 – Request for an update and a timeline for the fix.

11/06/2024 – [Advisory](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc) published without any notification.

Further details are available at:

* <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc>
* <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc>

### Multiple race conditions in anti-brute force mechanism

Keycloak implements an [anti-brute force mechanism](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#password-guess-brute-force-attacks) (which is not enabled by default) which should limit the attack attempts by locking out user accounts after a configured number of incorrect login attempts.

Based on our analysis, the software **didn’t implement mechanisms to prevent concurrent access** to security-critical resources, such as the number of failed authentication attempts. Therefore, it’s possible to **send multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads, allowing the attacker to perform many more login attempts than allowed, and consequently partially bypassing the anti-brute-force mechanism**. Furthermore, when the account is locked out, active sessions are not invalidated.

The issue has been verified both on the username and password-based login and on the OTP request. No checks have been performed on the “Quick Login Check Milliseconds” functionality, but we expect it to be affected by the same issue. The configuration used for testing was set to lockout accounts after 3 incorrect login attempts.

The communication timeline follows:

18/04/2024 – First communication with details.

18/04/2024 – Response: we can’t see the details.

18/04/2024 – Send details again as an attachment.

02/05/2024 – Request for a follow-up.

09/05/2024 – Response: **CVE-2024-4629** assigned, fix in backlog.

24/05/2024 – Request for a roadmap of the fix.

22/08/2024 – Request for a follow-up.

26/08/2024 – Response: Already fixed and published as a [public issue](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/31726).

03/09/2024 – [CVE-2024-4629](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-4629) is published.

### Some final considerations

**Authentication is one of the fundamental mechanisms to ensure the security of applications** and Keycloak is considered to be one of the standard open source software on which many organizations rely for their authentication needs.

I am a strong proponent of open source. However, I believe that **those who develop important projects should carefully consider the impact that their work can have**. I think that for a centralized authentication system, a bypass of the two-factor authentication should be solved or at least mitigated in a timely manner: 10 months is a lot of time to fix a core feature of a security product.

Furthermore, communication with security researchers and, crucially, product users should be as clear and explicit as possible. Keycloak’s advisories are very generic and do not allow users to understand what the actual impacts of the vulnerabilities are. **Attackers can easily look at the code, understand it, and exploit any vulnerability, but the poor system administrator who needs to figure out if it’s important to quickly update certainly will not do that…**

# RHSA-2024:6497 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Images](#containers)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift image enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

A new image is available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10, running on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 and 3.11, and 4.3. This is a
security update with Moderate impact rating.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is an integrated sign-on solution, available as a
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift containerized image. The Red Hat
Single Sign-On for OpenShift image provides an authentication server that
you can use to log in centrally, log out, and register. You can also manage
user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web
services.

This erratum releases a new image for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for
use within the OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, OpenShift Container Platform
3.11, and within the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for
on-premise or private cloud deployments, aligning with the standalone product release.

Security fixes:

* potential bypass of brute force protection (CVE-2024-4629)
* session fixation in elytron saml adapters (CVE-2024-7341)
* Leak of configured LDAP bind credentials through the Keycloak admin console (CVE-2024-5967)

## Solution

To update to the latest Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift
image, Follow these steps to pull in the content:

1. On your main hosts, ensure you are logged into the CLI as a
cluster administrator or user with project administrator access
to the global "openshift" project. For example:

$ oc login -u system:admin

2. Update the core set of Red Hat Single Sign-On resources for OpenShift
in the "openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ for resource in sso76-image-stream.json \
sso76-https.json \
sso76-mysql.json \
sso76-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-postgresql.json \
sso76-postgresql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-https.json \
sso76-x509-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.10.GA/templates/$](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.10.GA/templates/%24){resource}
done

3. Install the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift streams in the
"openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-sso76-openshift:1.0
