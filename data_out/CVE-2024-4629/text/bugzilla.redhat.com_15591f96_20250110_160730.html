This flaw allows attackers to bypass brute force protection by exploiting the timing of login attempts. By initiating multiple login requests simultaneously, attackers can exceed the configured limits for failed attempts before the system locks them out. This timing loophole enables attackers to make more guesses at passwords than intended, potentially compromising account security on affected systems. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-04-23 21:22:17 UTC  ``` Summary: If an attacker launches many login attempts in parallel then the attacker can have more guesses at a password than the brute force protection configuration permits. This is due to the brute force check occurring before the brute force protector has locked the user.  Requirements to exploit: Keycloak configured with Brute Force Protection  Component affected: org.keycloak:keycloak-services (Authentication)  Version affected: <= 24.0.3   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2024:6499 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6499](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6499)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:6493 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6493](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6493)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:00:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6494)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:01:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6501 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6501](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6501)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:06:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6500 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6500](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6500)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:07:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:6495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6495)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2276761#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:12:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497)   ``` |  |
