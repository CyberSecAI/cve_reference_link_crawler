Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32199

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `file` parameter in Scriptcase versions 9.9.008 and earlier, which allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly validate the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside the intended directory.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** By manipulating the directory path, the attacker can specify any file on the system (where the webserver has appropriate permissions) and trigger deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the system that the web server process has write access to, which can lead to data loss and/or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker would need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint of Scriptcase, manipulating the `file` parameter to include directory traversal sequences followed by the path of the target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Scriptcase instance.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs knowledge of how to manipulate HTTP requests.

**Additional Details**
- The provided GitHub link contains a proof-of-concept exploit script (`CVE-2022-32199.py`) that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The PoC is shown to delete files via a directory traversal sequence.
- The vulnerability is located in ScriptCase <= 9.9.008.
