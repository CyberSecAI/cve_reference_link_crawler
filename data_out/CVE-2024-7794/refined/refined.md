Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `mybill.php` file of the "Vehicle Management System Project" due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain full control of the system by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause a denial-of-service by disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `mybill.php` file. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The attack is performed via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `mybill.php` file.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Vehicle Management System Project in PHP".
*   The provided payloads demonstrate different types of SQL injection attacks: boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query.
*   The provided links include screenshots of successful SQL injection attacks using the `sqlmap` tool.
