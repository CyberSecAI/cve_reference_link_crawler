- Revealing chunk boundaries through timing side channels.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Executing the vulnerable command on a shard without proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L) to execute commands.
- The attack can be done over the network (AV:N)
- The attacker does not need user interaction (UI:N)
