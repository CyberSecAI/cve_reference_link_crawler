Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the backup files stored within the Dreamer CMS. Specifically, the `/resources/backups/` directory and its subdirectories containing SQL backup files for each date are accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary weakness is the ability to access backup files without any authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Directory Traversal:**  The vulnerability allows attackers to traverse date-based subdirectories, enabling them to potentially access a range of backup files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can download sensitive SQL backup files which may contain database credentials, user information, and potentially other confidential data from the CMS.
*   **Compromise of the CMS:** Gaining access to the database can lead to a full compromise of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can directly access the backup files by crafting URLs to download files from the `/resources/backups/` directory using date traversal. For example, by going to `/resources/backups/2024-02-06/2024-02-06_system_user.sql`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker only needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Dreamer CMS instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Dreamer CMS version 4.1.3.
*   The content references specific SQL dump files such as `2024-02-06_system_user.sql`
*   The provided images showcase how an unauthenticated user can directly access and download these backups.
