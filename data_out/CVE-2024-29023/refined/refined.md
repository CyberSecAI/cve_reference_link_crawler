Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the exposure of session tokens in the response of the session search API call, specifically on the sessions page. These session tokens, if exfiltrated, can be used to hijack active sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** Session tokens are directly exposed in the API response on the sessions page.
- **Session Hijacking:** The exposed tokens can be used to impersonate legitimate users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts by using the stolen session tokens.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By hijacking a session of a high-privilege user such as a super admin, an attacker may perform actions they are not authorized to do.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information, depending on the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network through the session search API.
- **API Access:** The attacker needs to access the session search API on the sessions page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the Session Page:** The attacker needs to have user access to the session page, or be a super admin.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make API calls to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Token Exfiltration:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and exfiltrate the exposed session tokens.

**Additional Notes:**
- Patches have been released in versions 3.3.10 and 4.0.9 of Xibo CMS to resolve this issue, and patches are available for older, unsupported versions.
