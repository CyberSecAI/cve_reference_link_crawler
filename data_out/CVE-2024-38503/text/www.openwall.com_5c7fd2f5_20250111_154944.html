Subject: CVE-2024-38503: Apache Syncope: HTML tags can be injected into
 Console or Enduser text fields

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Syncope 2.1 through 2.1.14
- Apache Syncope 3.0 through 3.0.7

Description:

When editing a user, group or any object in the Syncope Console, HTML tags could be added to any text field and could lead to potential exploits.
The same vulnerability was found in the Syncope Enduser, when editing “Personal Information” or “User Requests”.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.8, which fixes this issue.
