Subject: CVE-2024-38503: Apache Syncope: HTML tags can be injected into
 Console or Enduser text fields

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Syncope 2.1 through 2.1.14
- Apache Syncope 3.0 through 3.0.7

Description:

When editing a user, group or any object in the Syncope Console, HTML tags could be added to any text field and could lead to potential exploits.
The same vulnerability was found in the Syncope Enduser, when editing “Personal Information” or “User Requests”.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.8, which fixes this issue.

# Security Advisories

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache Syncope.

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to apply a source code patch, use the
[building instructions](building.html) or
[re-generate your Maven project](docs/getting-started.html#create-project) from published archetype.

If you want to report a vulnerability, please follow [the procedure](https://www.apache.org/security/).

## CVE-2024-45031: Apache Syncope: Stored XSS in Console and Enduser

When editing objects in the Syncope Console, incomplete HTML tags could be used to bypass HTML sanitization. This made it possible to inject stored XSS payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application.

XSS payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing “Personal Information” or “User Requests”: such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking.

**Severity**

Moderate

**Affects**

* 3.0 through 3.0.8
* 2.1 through 2.1.14

**Solution**

* Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.9, which fixes this issue.

**Fixed in**

* Release 3.0.9

Read the [full CVE advisory](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-45031).

## CVE-2024-38503: HTML tags can be injected into Console or Enduser text fields

When editing a user, group or any object in the Syncope Console, HTML tags could be added to any text field and could lead to potential exploits.
The same vulnerability was found in the Syncope Enduser, when editing “Personal Information” or “User Requests”.

**Severity**

Moderate

**Affects**

* 3.0 through 3.0.7
* 2.1 through 2.1.14

**Solution**

* Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.8, which fixes this issue.

**Fixed in**

Read the [full CVE advisory](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-38503).

## CVE-2020-11977: Remote Code Execution via Flowable workflow definition

When the Flowable extension is enabled, an administrator with workflow entitlements can use Shell Service Tasks to perform malicious operations, including but not limited
to file read, file write, and code execution.

**Severity**

Low

**Affects**

* 2.1.X releases prior to 2.1.7

**Solution**

* 2.1.X users should upgrade to 2.1.7

**Fixed in**

Read the [full CVE advisory](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11977).

## CVE-2020-1961: Server-Side Template Injection on mail templates

Vulnerability to Server-Side Template Injection on Mail templates enabling attackers to inject arbitrary JEXL
expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) was discovered.

**Severity**

Important

**Affects**

* 2.0.X releases prior to 2.0.15
* 2.1.X releases prior to 2.1.6

**Solution**

## CVE-2020-1959: Multiple Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Syncope enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL
expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom
constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL
expressions.
Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be
able to run arbitrary Java code.

**Severity**

Important

**Affects**

* 2.1.X releases prior to 2.1.6

**Solution**

* 2.1.X users should upgrade to 2.1.6

**Fixed in**

It was found that the EndUser UI login page reflects the successMessage parameters.
By this mean, a user accessing the Enduser UI could execute javascript code from URL query string.

**Severity**

Medium

**Affects**
