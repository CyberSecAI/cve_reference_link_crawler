- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Advanced" tab allows users to input arbitrary text into a textarea field, and this input is not properly sanitized before being rendered on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which will be executed when a user accesses the settings page. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the plugin's settings page. They can then insert malicious code into the textarea field located under the "Advanced" tab and save the settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a high-privilege user account such as admin to access the plugin settings.
