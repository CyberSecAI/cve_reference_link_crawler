## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP QuickLaTeX < 3.8.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to plugin settings
2. Under the "Advanced" tab, enter the payload `</textarea><script>alert(/XSS: quicklatex[preamble]/)</script>` in the textarea
3. Save the settings and reload to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
