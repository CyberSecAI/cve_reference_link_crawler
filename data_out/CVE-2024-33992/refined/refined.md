- The attacker then tricks a victim into clicking the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute the malicious URL.
- The victim must be a user of the affected application and have an active session.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable parameter is "view" in `/student/index.php`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application reflects user-supplied input in the response without proper sanitization.
