Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-39612:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper Content-Security-Policy (CSP) for the `/api/raw` endpoint in FileBrowser. The CSP was set to `default-src 'self'`, which allowed the execution of Javascript loaded from the same site, even if originating from a low-privileged user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A non-admin user can create malicious HTML and JavaScript files within the file system accessible via the application.
- **CSP bypass:** The default CSP policy `default-src 'self'` was insufficient to prevent XSS attacks, as malicious Javascript files from the same domain could be loaded and executed.
- **JWT authentication bypass:** The API accepted a JWT token as a URL parameter, allowing the non-admin user to specify their own token when the admin user accesses the malicious URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Admin account takeover:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can steal the admin's session cookie, leading to complete account takeover.
- **Arbitrary command execution:** After taking over the admin account, the attacker can run shell commands and access the filesystem, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the path to the malicious HTML file (`xss.htm`), the non-admin user's JWT token, and the `inline=true` parameter: `http://your_filebrowser_ip:port//api/raw/poc/xss.htm?auth=[non-admin user's jwt token]&inline=true`
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the admin user into opening the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a non-admin user account on the FileBrowser instance.
- The attacker must be able to create files within the application's file system.
- The attacker must be able to create and craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker must have the non-admin user's JWT token.
- The attacker needs to socially engineer the Admin to click the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a CSP that blocks any Javascript from executing on the `/api/raw` endpoint. This was achieved by setting `script-src 'none'` in the Content Security Policy.
- The fix was implemented in commit `b508ac3d4f7f0f75d6b49c99bdc661a6d2173f30` and included in Filebrowser v2.25.0.
- The vulnerability was initially reported through huntr.dev, and the disclosure was not initially noticed. The public issue on GitHub was created after the initial private report and lack of response.
