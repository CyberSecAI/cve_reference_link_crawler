**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5246

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The SICK Flexi Soft Gateways are vulnerable to an authentication bypass. This is due to the possibility of capturing and replaying authentication packets.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the gateways.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   The attacker needs to capture network traffic containing authentication attempts.
*   The attacker then replays the captured authentication packets to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to capture network traffic to obtain the authentication packets.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
*   The attack is successful when the attacker is on the same network as the affected device(s)
