- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Events Rich Snippets for Google Plugin version 1.8 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious requests that target the vulnerable plugin functionality, and tricking an authenticated user into triggering the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to make a crafted request. This doesn't require authentication in the plugin itself, but relies on the victim's authenticated session.
