[`cc26860`](/btcsuite/btcd/commit/cc26860b40265e1332cca8748c5dbaf3c81cc094)

This commit was created on GitHub.com and signed with GitHub’s **verified signature**.

GPG key ID: B5690EEEBB952194

[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This release includes important bug fixes related to subtle interactions related to re-orgs and the UTXO set cache. These fixed are considered **security critical**.

This release also includes implementations of `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` which can be useful in helping nodes that were afflicted by the aforementioned bugs to recover without needing to resync the entire chain.

WIth this release, `btcd` now also implements the `testmempoolaccept` RPC which can be useful to check a transaction candidate for validity from a policy and conflict perspective before broadcasting. Along the way, we've added some additional policy checks that exist in other Bitcoin full node implementations.

This release also contains fixes to some parsing issues discovered via fuzz testing.

Finally, as mentioned above release includes **important security** fixes, with full details to be disclosed in **90 days**.
