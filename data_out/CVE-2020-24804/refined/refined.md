Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is logging of sensitive information, specifically username and password, in plain text via the `logger.info` function within the `cms/cmscontrib/AddAdmin.py` script. This happens when a new admin user is created using the `add_admin` function. The script outputs the created user's username and password to the standard output/log, which is not secure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive authentication credentials (username and password) in the logs/stdout.
*   **Plaintext Storage/Transfer:**  Although not explicitly stored in a file, the output is in plaintext and can be viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Compromise:** If an attacker gains access to the logs, they would obtain the administrator's username and password in plain text. This would lead to a complete compromise of the CMS application and its data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker would gain administrative privileges, allowing them to control the CMS.
*   **Data Breach:** With admin access, the attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the logs through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising the server hosting the application
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logging system
    *   Gaining access to the system through other means like phishing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to logs:** The attacker needs the ability to access the logs generated by the `cms/cmscontrib/AddAdmin.py` script. This can range from having access to the server's file system to compromising the logging system itself.
*   **No direct network access needed:** The vulnerability exists in how the application handles information internally and doesn't require direct network exploitation. The attacker needs access to the systemâ€™s log files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is primarily related to the `cmsAddAdmin` script.
*   The vulnerability is acknowledged by the developers, and it's indicated they will address this in the future by logging the password only when it's automatically generated instead of when it is provided through command line arguments.

This issue is categorized as a "bug" and marked as a priority "P1", indicating it is considered a significant problem.
