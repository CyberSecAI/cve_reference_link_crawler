| Uhmmmmmm...... that's normal. It's where the cmsAddAdmin script reminds you of the login info for the admin account you just created. That does not constitute a leak. |

| I'm not sure about it but is it really normal to log plain text passwords?  In this special case I think it's ok since `logger.info` is being used as a normal stdout `print` statement. Also there must be a way to let the user know the randomly generated password.  [@niuzhi](https://github.com/niuzhi) Do you have a more secure way in mind to do this? |

| I agree that we could at least log the password only when it gets randomly generated (i.e. the `password is None` case) and skip showing it when it's provided (i.e. when we call `cmsAddAdmin ... -p thepassword`) |
