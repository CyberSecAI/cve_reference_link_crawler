- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of encryption certificates in S/MIME emails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A sender's email address could be leaked when sending an S/MIME encrypted email using a certificate with more than one email address.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted S/MIME encrypted email using a certificate with multiple email addresses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send an email to a target user and possess a certificate with multiple email addresses.
