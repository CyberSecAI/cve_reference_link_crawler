### @dcousens **[dcousens](/dcousens)** commented [Aug 15, 2023](#issue-1850797172) • edited Loading

* Fixes [GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c "GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c")

Please see the security vulnerability report for an up-to-date description and work-around if you can't update.

#### What happened

The default AdminUI middleware **prevents** access to the AdminUI if

* a `session` strategy configuration has been defined, and
* `context.session` is `undefined` or falsey

This is not what happens for the `adminMeta` GraphQL query, which falls back on public access when `isAccessAllowed` is undefined.

The GraphQL and AdminUI middleware behaviour should be the same.

We haven't committed or documented what the behaviour should be, so what we fall back on is open ended.

In this pull request, I have opted to fall back to the same behaviour as the default Admin UI middleware, as the behaviour that users would have observed and probably expect.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Maybe in the near future, we should drop the `isAccessAllowed` default, and instead update the types (or validation errors) to ensure that `isAccessAllowed` is *always* defined if a `session` is defined. |

# When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is undefined, the admin meta GraphQL query is publicly accessible

Moderate

GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c
Aug 15, 2023

## Package

npm

@keystone-6/core
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<5.5.0

## Patched versions

5.5.1

## Description

### Summary

When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is `undefined`, the `adminMeta` GraphQL query is publicly accessible, that is to say, no session is required for the query.

This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI middleware, which by default will only be publicly accessible if a `session` strategy is not defined.

### Impact

This vulnerability does not affect developers using the `@keystone-6/auth` package, or any users that have written their own `ui.isAccessAllowed` (that is to say, you are unaffected if `ui.isAccessAllowed` is defined).

This vulnerability does affect developers who thought that their `session` strategy will, by default, enforce that `adminMeta` is inaccessible by the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of the AdminUI middleware.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version `5.5.1`.

### Workarounds

You can opt to write your own `isAccessAllowed` to work-around this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
