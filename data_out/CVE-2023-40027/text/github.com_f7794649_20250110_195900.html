### @dcousens **[dcousens](/dcousens)** commented [Aug 15, 2023](#issue-1850797172) • edited Loading

* Fixes [GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c "GHSA-9cvc-v7wm-992c")

Please see the security vulnerability report for an up-to-date description and work-around if you can't update.

#### What happened

The default AdminUI middleware **prevents** access to the AdminUI if

* a `session` strategy configuration has been defined, and
* `context.session` is `undefined` or falsey

This is not what happens for the `adminMeta` GraphQL query, which falls back on public access when `isAccessAllowed` is undefined.

The GraphQL and AdminUI middleware behaviour should be the same.

We haven't committed or documented what the behaviour should be, so what we fall back on is open ended.

In this pull request, I have opted to fall back to the same behaviour as the default Admin UI middleware, as the behaviour that users would have observed and probably expect.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Maybe in the near future, we should drop the `isAccessAllowed` default, and instead update the types (or validation errors) to ensure that `isAccessAllowed` is *always* defined if a `session` is defined. |
