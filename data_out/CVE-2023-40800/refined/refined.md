Based on the provided information, this document describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC23 router firmware version V16.03.07.45_cn.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `compare_parentcontrol_time` function within the `saveParentControlInfo` functionality does not validate the length of the user-supplied "time" parameter before using `sscanf` to copy it into a stack buffer, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Lack of input validation on the length of the `time` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, which can lead to a denial of service by crashing the device.
- With careful crafting of the overflow payload, the attacker can gain remote code execution on the device and achieve a root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- The request must include an overly long value in the `time` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This likely implies that they are on the same network as the router or can access it through a port forwarding or a similar mechanism.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameters.
- No authentication is required for triggering the vulnerability.

The provided content gives more detail than the typical CVE description by providing the exact vulnerable function, a proof-of-concept HTTP request, and evidence of the crash after exploiting. It also provides evidence of the possibility to achieve remote code execution after careful payload construction.
