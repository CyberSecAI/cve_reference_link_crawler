Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-29864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption in the OPC UA .NET Standard Stack. A malicious client can trigger an out-of-memory exception on the server by sending a large number of message chunks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The software does not properly limit the amount of resources (in this case, memory) it consumes when processing a large number of message chunks, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). An attacker can cause the server to crash by exhausting its memory resources, making the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). A malicious client sends a large number of message chunks to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the OPC UA server (PR:N - no privileges required). The attacker does not need user interaction (UI:N). The attacker's position is on the network, and no special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the OPC UA .NET Standard Stack.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 (high).
- The CVSS vector string is: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
- The vulnerability has not been publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the security bulletin publication.
- The OPC Foundation recommends using a physically secured network to prevent unauthorized clients from connecting as a workaround.
- The issue has been fixed in the updated versions of OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard (version 1.4.368.58 or later) and OPCFoundation/UA-.NET-Legacy (commit 35199e43d46f0eef793cace12baa806838ddba2c or later).
