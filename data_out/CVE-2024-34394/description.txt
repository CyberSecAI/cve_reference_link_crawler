libxmljs2 is vulnerable to a type confusion vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted XML while invoking the namespaces() function (which invokes XmlNode::get_local_namespaces()) on a grand-child of a node that refers to an entity. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service and remote code execution.
