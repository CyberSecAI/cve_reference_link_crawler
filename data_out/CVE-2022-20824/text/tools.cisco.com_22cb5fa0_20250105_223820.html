This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of specific values that are within a Cisco Discovery Protocol message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with *root* privileges or cause the Cisco Discovery Protocol process to crash and restart multiple times, which would cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note:** Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-cdp-dos-ce-wWvPucC9>  This advisory is part of the August 2022 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol for Cisco FXOS Software In all releases of Cisco FXOS Software, Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on the management (mgmt0) port. In Cisco FXOS Software releases earlier than Release 2.1, Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on all front-panel ports as well as the management (mgmt0) port. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco MDS and Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To determine whether Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on a Cisco MDS or Nexus Switch that is running Cisco NX-OS Software, use the **show running-config cdp all | include "cdp enable"** command in the device CLI. If the command returns at least the following lines, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled globally and on at least one interface:  ```   nxos# show running-config cdp all | include "cdp enable"   cdp enable     cdp enable   ```  In addition, the **show cdp all** command can be used to verify the status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on all interfaces of the device. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode Cisco Discovery Protocol is disabled by default on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode. To determine the status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on all interfaces of a device, use the **show cdp all** command in the device CLI. To determine if Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on at least one interface, use the **show cdp all | grep "enabled on"** command. If the command returns any output, as in the following example, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on at least one interface:  ```   nxos# show cdp all | grep "enabled on"       CDP enabled on interface   ``` Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects On Cisco UCS 6200, 6300, and 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled on the following ports:    + Ethernet uplink ports (network interfaces that connect to upstream switches for network connectivity)   + Ethernet port channel members   + Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) uplink ports   + Management ports Cisco Discovery Protocol may also be enabled on server ports (interfaces that are presented to the servers in the Cisco UCS Manager domain) and appliance ports (interfaces that connect to directly attached NFS storage). To determine the status of Cisco Discovery Protocol on these ports, use the **show configuration | egrep "^ scope|enable cdp"** command in the device CLI. If the command returns **enable cdp** under the **org** scope, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on server ports. If the command returns **enable cdp** under the **eth-storage** scope, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on appliance ports. The following example shows the output of the command on a device that has Cisco Discovery Protocol enabled on server ports and appliance ports:  ```   ucs-fi# show configuration | egrep "^ scope|enable cdp"   .   .   .    scope org            enable cdp   .   .   .    scope eth-storage            enable cdp   .   .   .   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, customers who do not use Cisco Discovery Protocol can disable the feature either globally, to fully close the attack vector, or on individual interfaces, to reduce the attack surface. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol in Cisco FXOS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol is always enabled and cannot be disabled in Cisco FXOS Software. In Cisco FXOS Software releases 2.1 and later, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on the management (mgmt0) port only. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol Globally on Cisco MDS and Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol globally on a Cisco MDS or Nexus Switch, use the **no cdp enable** command in global configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   nxos# conf t   Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.   nxos(config)# no cdp enable    nxos(config)# end   nxos# copy running-config startup-config    [########################################] 100%   Copy complete.   ``` Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an Interface on Cisco MDS and Nexus Switches that are Running Cisco NX-OS Software To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an interface on a Cisco MDS or Nexus Switch, use the **no cdp enable** command in interface configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   nxos# conf t   Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.   nxos(config)# interface Ethernet1/1   nxos(config-if)# no cdp enable    nxos(config-if)# end   nxos# copy running-config startup-config   [########################################] 100%   Copy complete.   ``` Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects Cisco Discovery Protocol cannot be disabled completely on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Discovery Protocol can be disabledon server ports and appliance ports on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects, but it cannot be disabledon Ethernet uplink ports, Ethernet port channel members, FCoE uplink ports, or management ports.  To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on theserver ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, use the **disable cdp** command in the default **nw-ctrl-policy** in the **org** scope, as shown in the following example:  ```   ucs-fi# scope org   ucs-fi /org # enter nw-ctrl-policy default   ucs-fi /org/nw-ctrl-policy # disable cdp   ucs-fi /org/nw-ctrl-policy* # exit   ucs-fi /org* # exit   ucs-fi* # commit-buffer   ucs-fi#    ```  To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on theappliance ports of a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, use the **disable cdp** command in the default **nw-ctrl-policy** in the **eth-storage** scope, as shown in the following example:  ```   ucs-fi* # scope eth-storage   ucs-fi /eth-storage* # enter nw-ctrl-policy default   ucs-fi /eth-storage/nw-ctrl-policy* # disable cdp   ucs-fi /eth-storage/nw-ctrl-policy* # exit   ucs-fi /eth-storage* # exit   ucs-fi* # commit-buffer   ucs-fi#    ```  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.
