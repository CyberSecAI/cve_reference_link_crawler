  "CVE-2022-31460": {
    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Meeting Owl Pro device related to its Wi-Fi access point (AP) tethering mode. This mode allows the device to act as a Wi-Fi access point while also being connected to another network. The vulnerability arises from the lack of restrictions on this mode, allowing the device to pass network traffic between the two networks, effectively acting as a rogue access point.",
    "root_cause": "The Meeting Owl Pro device, when operating in Wi-Fi AP tethering mode, does not restrict network traffic passthrough, allowing it to function as a rogue access point.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted network traffic passthrough in Wi-Fi AP tethering mode",
        "Lack of proper isolation between the device's connection to the organization's network and the rogue access point's network"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who compromises the Meeting Owl Pro device can use it as a rogue access point to infiltrate a network, exfiltrate data, or introduce malware. This can result in the compromise of the organization's network security and data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation of other vulnerabilities in the Meeting Owl Pro to gain initial access and control of the device",
       "Exploitation via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functionalities"
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to compromise the Meeting Owl Pro device via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth vulnerabilities",
       "Proximity to the device in order to exploit Bluetooth vulnerabilities"
      ],
    "remediation": "The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the passthrough of networking traffic in Wi-Fi AP tethering mode in software version 5.4.1.4 on June 6, 2022."
