- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the server-side application trusting client-side data for user role management. Specifically, the DefectDojo application only enforces restrictions on superuser role assignment through the web interface, while the server-side API accepts the `is_superuser` parameter in user creation/edit requests even when it's not exposed in the UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Client-side validation bypass:** The application relies on client-side validation to prevent privilege escalation, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating HTTP requests.
    - **Missing server-side authorization:** The server fails to properly validate user permissions when processing user creation/edit requests. It allows a Staff User to elevate their privileges to Superuser by directly setting the `is_superuser` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A Staff User can escalate their privileges to Superuser, gaining full control of the application. This includes:
    - Access to the Django Admin interface.
    - The ability to modify system-wide settings.
    - Access to other user's data.
    - The ability to control integration keys for the API.
    - Potential to input malicious data.
    - Could lock other users out of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Manipulating HTTP POST requests with a web proxy tool like Burp Suite or OWASP Zap Proxy or through the browser's developer tools.
    - Directly adding the `is_superuser=on` parameter to the POST request during user creation or editing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a Staff User account in DefectDojo. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
