- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient security restrictions when executing commands from the Bash shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary code execution due to insufficient security restrictions when executing commands from the Bash shell
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell can exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific crafted command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the device with privileges to access the Bash shell.
