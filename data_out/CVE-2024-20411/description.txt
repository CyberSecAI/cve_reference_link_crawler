A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell to&nbsp;execute arbitrary code as root on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions when executing commands from the Bash shell. An attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific crafted command on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of root.
