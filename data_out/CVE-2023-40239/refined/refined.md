- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in older Lexmark devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the improper handling of XML input, allowing an attacker to inject external entities. This is a classic XXE vulnerability (CWE-611).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to extract information from the affected Lexmark device. The impact is primarily a confidentiality breach, as it focuses on data exfiltration, with no mention of other impacts such as code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, and does not require any user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Lexmark device. The attacker requires high privileges on the device in order to exploit the vulnerability.
