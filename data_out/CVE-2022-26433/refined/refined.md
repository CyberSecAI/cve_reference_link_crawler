- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Type confusion in the mailbox component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access of resource using incompatible type leading to a type confusion issue. This allows for an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs locally, requiring System execution privileges. No user interaction is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have system execution privileges to exploit this vulnerability locally.
