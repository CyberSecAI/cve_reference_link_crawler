The provided content relates to CVE-2023-5784.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the Netcom NS-ASG application security gateway.
- The `$FireWallId` database value, taken from the `messagecontent` parameter, is directly substituted into a database query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `/protocol/firewall/uploadfirewall.php`.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization before using user-supplied data in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- Potential for complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `/protocol/index.php` with a malicious payload in the `messagecontent` parameter of the `jsoncontent` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- They do not need to be authenticated, as demonstrated in the provided exploit.
- The server address is explicitly provided in the proof-of-concept ([106.37.206.12](https://106.37.206.12/)).
