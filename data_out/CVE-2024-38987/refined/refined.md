Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-38987

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `defaultsDeep` function within the `@aofl/cli-lib` module. This function recursively copies properties from a source object to a destination object without proper validation. Specifically, it fails to prevent the modification of the prototype of the `Object` class through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is a prototype pollution vulnerability. By injecting malicious payloads through `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties in the user-supplied input, an attacker can modify the prototype of the `Object` class.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By altering the behavior of all objects, an attacker can cause the application to crash, freeze, or become unresponsive.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, prototype pollution can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution by manipulating specific application logic.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In web applications, polluted prototypes might lead to XSS vulnerabilities if they're used to control HTML or JavaScript rendering.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying internal system objects and behaviors an attacker can escalate their privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector is via user-supplied input that is passed to the vulnerable `defaultsDeep` function. This input can be controlled by the attacker, allowing them to inject malicious payloads.
- **Special Properties:** Specifically, the attacker leverages the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties within this input to pollute the prototype chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control Over Input:** The attacker needs to have control over the input data processed by the `defaultsDeep` function.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the prototype pollution vulnerability in the `defaultsDeep` function and understand how to exploit it using the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the `@aofl/cli-lib` module up to and including 3.14.0 are vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:** The maintainer has not provided an official patch. Users are urged to implement input sanitization and validation to block inputs containing `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`.
