# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in MEGABOT

Critical

[NicPWNs](/NicPWNs)
published
GHSA-vhxp-4hwq-w3p2
Aug 20, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.5.0

## Patched versions

1.5.0

## Description

### Impact

The `/math` command and functionality of MEGABOT versions < [1.5.0](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/releases/tag/v1.5.0) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to a Python `eval()`. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject Python code into the `expression` parameter when using `/math` in any Discord channel. This vulnerability impacts any discord guild utilizing MEGABOT.

### Patches

This vulnerability was fixed in [pull request #138](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/pull/138) and release version [1.5.0](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/releases/tag/v1.5.0). The patch has been pushed through the GitHub actions workflow and fixed for the majority of users. However, anyone who may manually clone the codebase and run the bot will need to upgrade manually starting at versions [1.5.0](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/releases/tag/v1.5.0) and above.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds. Use version [1.5.0](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/releases/tag/v1.5.0) or greater.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
