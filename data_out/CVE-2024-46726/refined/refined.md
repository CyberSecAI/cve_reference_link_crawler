The provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an integer overflow and potential out-of-bounds access due to incorrect index calculation when accessing the `fclks->data` array in the `dcn_bw_update_from_pplib_fclks` function. The indices `vmid0p72_idx`, `vnom0p8_idx`, and `vmax0p9_idx` were not properly validated against the array size, leading to potential overflows and out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow during index calculation.
- Potential out-of-bounds access of the `fclks->data` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior due to memory access violations.
- Potentially, a malicious actor could exploit the vulnerability to gain access to memory outside of the intended boundaries.
- This can lead to denial-of-service or privilege escalation in some scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would be through the `dcn_bw_update_from_pplib_fclks` function.
- Providing a crafted `fclks` structure that causes the index calculations to overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to control the input `fclks->num_levels` to trigger the vulnerable code.
- This would most likely require a local user with the capability to modify system settings or access the driver in a specific way.
