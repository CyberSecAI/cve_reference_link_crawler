## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# RafflePress Lite < 1.12.14 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as editor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Note: This was partially fixed in 1.12.3, but if the payload was entered on a previous version of the plugin and then upgraded, the XSS still runs.
1. Go to "Rafflepress > Add New"
2. Add a new "Classic Giveway"
3. For the Giveaway description, enter the payload: `<meter value=2 min=0 max=10 onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>2 out of 10</meter>`
4. Save and preview to see the XSS
