- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks, depending on the attacker's payload.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the "Giveaway description" field of the RafflePress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with at least Editor-level privileges within WordPress can exploit this vulnerability. It also notes that payloads entered in older versions may still run even after upgrading the plugin.
