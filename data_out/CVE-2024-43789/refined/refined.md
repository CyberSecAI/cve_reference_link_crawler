- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Absence of restrictions on the number of replies to a post, allowing a user to create a post with many replies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation or rate limiting on the number of replies to a post. This allows a user to generate an excessive number of replies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user can create a post with many replies, and then attempt to fetch them all at once, which can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, specifically through a web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user able to create posts and replies. No special privileges are required. The attacker can be remote.
