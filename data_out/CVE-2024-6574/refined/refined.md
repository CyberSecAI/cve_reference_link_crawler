Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Laposta plugin for WordPress does not prevent direct access to several test files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin exposes the full server path of the web application due to the lack of access control on certain test files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the web application. This information, while not immediately damaging on its own, can be used to aid other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Vulnerable Files:** Attackers can directly access the unprotected test files via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin is no longer maintained and has been closed for downloads.
- The exposed information is not useful on its own and needs another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
- The provided reference link shows an example of a vulnerable file: `plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/laposta/trunk/includes/laposta-php-1.2/examples/member/all.php`.
