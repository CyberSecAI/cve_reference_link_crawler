Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4445

**Vulnerability Description:**

The WP Compress â€“ Image Optimizer [All-In-One] plugin for WordPress, in versions up to and including 6.20.01, is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on several functions. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or higher to edit plugin settings, including storing cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, in multisite environments.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks within the plugin's code, specifically within the `mu.class.php` file.  Several functions that modify plugin settings are missing capability checks, which would verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper capability checks on multiple functions that handle settings modifications.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the missing authorization, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into plugin settings, which could then be executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** Attackers can modify any plugin setting, potentially disrupting site functionality, impacting performance, or creating other malicious outcomes.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful XSS attacks can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Information theft

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin functions using the WordPress AJAX API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. Subscriber level access or higher is enough to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.
