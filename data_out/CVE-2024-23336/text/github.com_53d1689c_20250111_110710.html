# Incomplete disallowed remote addresses list SSRF

Low

[dvz](/dvz)
published
GHSA-qfrj-65mv-h75h
Apr 30, 2024

## Package

MyBB

## Affected versions

< 1.8.38

## Patched versions

1.8.38

## Description

### Impact

The default list of disallowed remote hosts does not contain the `127.0.0.0/8` block, which may result in a SSRF vulnerability.

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

### Details

The [Configuration File](https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/administration/configuration-file/)'s *Disallowed Remote Addresses* list (`$config['disallowed_remote_addresses']`) contains the address `127.0.0.1`, but does not include the complete block `127.0.0.0/8`.

### Patches

MyBB 1.8.38 resolves this issue with the following changes:

* Commit: [d6a9601](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/d6a96019025de9149014e06b1df252e6122e5630)
  + `.patch`: <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/d6a96019025de9149014e06b1df252e6122e5630.patch>

Administrators of installed boards should update the existing configuration (`inc/config.php`) to include all addresses blocked by default:

```
/**
 * Disallowed Remote Addresses
 *  List of IPv4 addresses the fetch_remote_file() function
 *  will not perform requests to.
 *  It is recommended that you enter addresses resolving to
 *  the forum server here to prevent Server Side Request
 *  Forgery attacks.
 *  Removing all values disables resolving hosts in that
 *  function.
 */

$config['disallowed_remote_addresses'] = array(
	'0.0.0.0',
	'127.0.0.0/8',
	'10.0.0.0/8',
	'172.16.0.0/12',
	'192.168.0.0/16',
);
```

Additionally, we recommend verifying that it includes any other IPv4 addresses resolving to the server and other internal resources.
