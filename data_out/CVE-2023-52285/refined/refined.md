{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (SQLi)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information such as user credentials (including hashed passwords), and manipulate data within the database.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `Pages.php` script. Specifically, the `s_id`, `s_name`, `s_score1`, and `s_score2` POST parameters are vulnerable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the application server to send HTTP requests. No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, since any user can potentially send a crafted request."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content confirms that all SQL statements in the application are vulnerable to SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information, such as teacher's passwords. The passwords are client-side hashed which means the hashes can be used to log in."
