The provided content is related to CVE-2024-20842.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in handling APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) in `libsec-ril`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation. The vulnerability allows writing out-of-bounds memory due to insufficient checks when handling APDU in `libsec-ril`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privileged attackers can write out-of-bounds memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other memory corruption issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has gained privileged access on the device.
- The vulnerability lies in the `libsec-ril` library, which is related to the Radio Interface Layer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local privileged access to the device is required.
- Knowledge of the `libsec-ril` API and how to craft malicious APDUs.
