Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `formSetWanPPTP` function of the D-Link DIR-605L router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formSetWanPPTP` function takes the `webpage` parameter from a POST request and copies it into a local buffer using `strcpy`.
- The size of the input `webpage` is not checked before the copy operation, leading to a buffer overflow if the `webpage` parameter is larger than the buffer allocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the device
    - Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the device
    - Other unpredictable behavior

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `goform/formSetWanPPTP` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to control the content of the `webpage` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router, which implies:
    - Network access to the router (e.g. same LAN or access via exposed WAN interface)
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the exploit does not rely on having an authenticated session.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable firmware version is D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01 BETA
- A Proof of Concept (POC) script has been provided, which demonstrates the vulnerability
- The `webpage` parameter should be larger than allocated buffer size to trigger the buffer overflow. The provided PoC uses 2000 bytes.
