- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in editable parameters within the 'General' and 'Team ID' functionalities, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can store a JavaScript payload, which when executed in a victim's browser, can lead to session takeover. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account and potentially sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious JavaScript payloads that are then injected into the vulnerable editable fields in the 'General' and 'Team ID' functionalities of the Holded web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with access to the editable fields in the 'General' and 'Team ID' functionalities. They need to be able to inject the malicious code. The CVSS vector indicates the attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and the attack requires user interaction (UI:R).
