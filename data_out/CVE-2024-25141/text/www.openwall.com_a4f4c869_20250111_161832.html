Subject: CVE-2024-25141: Apache Airflow Mongo Provider: Certificate
 validation isn't respected even if SSL is enabled for
 apache-airflow-providers-mongo

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow Mongo Provider 1.0.0 before 4.0.0

Description:

When ssl was enabled for Mongo Hook, default settings included "allow_insecure" which caused that certificates were not validated. This was unexpected and undocumented.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes this issue.
