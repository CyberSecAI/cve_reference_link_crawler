Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Form widget configuration, specifically within the `name` field. This allows users to inject malicious scripts.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the application. This could lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks. The CVSS score indicates a moderate impact on confidentiality and integrity, but no impact on availability.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the `name` field of the form configuration.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) within the Liferay system and the user has to be tricked into performing an action (UI:R) for the attack to be successful.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP form widget configuration. It is caused by insufficient input validation of the `name` field in form configuration. Attackers with low privileges can inject malicious code that executes in the context of other users.
