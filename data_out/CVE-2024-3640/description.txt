An unquoted executable path exists in the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk® Remote Access™ possibly resulting in remote code execution if exploited. While running the FTRA installer package, the executable path is not properly quoted, which could allow a threat actor to enter a malicious executable and run it as a System user. A threat actor needs admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
