  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `rndis_set_response` function in the Linux kernel due to insufficient bounds checking on `BufOffset` before adding 8.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. Although the provided information suggests the function returns -EINVAL, it is unclear if that always prevents exploitation. If an attacker can somehow cause a crafted `BufOffset` to lead to a later heap overflow or similar, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor can send a crafted RNDIS_MSG_SET command with a very large 'InformationBufferOffset' to trigger the integer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to send crafted USB RNDIS messages to the target device"
