Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-30190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the affected devices handle frame queuing in relation to power-saving mechanisms. Specifically, an attacker can trick the device into enabling its power-saving mechanisms for a victim client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Power Saving Mechanisms:** The device incorrectly manages its power-saving features, allowing an attacker to manipulate them.
*   **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290):** Although not explicitly stated, this vulnerability is categorized under CWE-290, suggesting a mechanism bypass via spoofed frames or other means. This vulnerability is related to "Abuse the queue for network disruptions" as described in CVE-2022-47522.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause disconnections and denial-of-service by forcing the device to activate power-saving for the victim client.
*   **Network Disruption:** By manipulating power-saving modes, the attacker disrupts network connectivity for the targeted client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physically Proximate Attacker:** The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the affected device.
*   **Manipulation of Wi-Fi Frames:** The attacker crafts and sends specific Wi-Fi frames to exploit the queuing and power-saving vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker must be physically close enough to the vulnerable device to communicate via Wi-Fi.
*   **Basic Wi-Fi knowledge:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of Wi-Fi protocols and the ability to craft and send malicious frames to the device.
*   **Low privilege:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs low privilege (PR:L), it is likely that the attacker can be an unauthenticated user on the network.
*   **User interaction:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker requires some user interaction (UI:R), which may indicate that the attacker needs to somehow induce the targeted device to process the crafted frames.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a set of three related vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-30189, CVE-2024-30190, and CVE-2024-30191) that were originally grouped under CVE-2022-47522 and has been further classified into the Framing Frames attacks.
*   The advisory references a research paper (<https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/usenix2023-wifi.pdf>) which further explains the vulnerabilities.
