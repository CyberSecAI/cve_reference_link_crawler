Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Pz-LinkCard WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied settings, specifically in the "Class ID to be Added (for PC)" setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin stores unsanitized user input, and displays it in the front end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected pages/posts.
- This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., Admin) of the WordPress site.
- The attacker would input a malicious payload into the "Class ID to be Added (for PC)" setting of the plugin.
- The XSS is triggered when a user views a page or post containing a blogcard shortcode and moves the mouse over the generated card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative or similar high-level access to the WordPress dashboard.
- The attacker does not need any specific technical expertise beyond being able to copy and paste the provided payload.
