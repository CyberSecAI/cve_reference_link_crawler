## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pz-LinkCard < 2.5.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Class ID to be Added (for PC)" setting of the plugin (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pz-linkcard-settings > Advanced): " onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
Then open page/post containing a blogcard shortcode (such as [blogcard url="aaa"]) and move the mouse over the generated card to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
