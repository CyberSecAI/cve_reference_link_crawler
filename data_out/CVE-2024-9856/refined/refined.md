Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "System Settings" page of the 07FlyCms application. This allows for the injection of malicious code through input fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - **Front-end XSS:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution when users view affected pages. This could lead to:
     - Session hijacking
     - Stealing cookies or sensitive data
     - Defacement of the website
     - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - **Back-end XSS:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the administrator's browser when they view affected pages. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized changes to the system
    - Account compromise
    - Data exfiltration
    - Full control over the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the input fields on the "System Settings" page in the 07FlyCms administration panel. Specifically, any input box within this page is susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administration panel of the 07FlyCms application. This requires valid administrator credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and submit malicious input into the vulnerable fields.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided POC `"><script>alert("mirage")</script>` demonstrates how an attacker can inject a simple JavaScript alert. More complex and malicious scripts could be used to achieve a wider range of malicious outcomes.

**Affected Version:**
- 07FlyCms version 1.3.8 is specifically vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in both the front-end and back-end of the application.
- The provided links point to a GitHub repository where the vulnerability is documented.
