Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34545:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the CSZCMS application. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input that is used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-controlled data into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including:
    - **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, potentially causing service disruption or data integrity issues.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to escalate privileges by manipulating user accounts in the database.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could potentially cause the application to crash by running disruptive SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `p` parameter or through the search URL. These are the mechanisms through which the attacker injects malicious SQL code into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, requiring no prior access to the system. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CSZCMS instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** It appears no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it a highly accessible risk.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable version is specifically CSZCMS version 1.3.0.
- The vulnerability is present in how the application handles the `p` parameter in URLs and/or search URLs
