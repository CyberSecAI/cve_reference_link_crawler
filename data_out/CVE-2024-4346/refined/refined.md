Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin fails to properly validate the path of an uploaded file before attempting to delete it. This lack of validation allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server accessible to the webserver process without needing to authenticate.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input, which is then used to construct file paths, allowing access to locations outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the server, including critical files like `wp-config.php`.
- **Site Takeover:** Deletion of critical files like `wp-config.php` can lead to site takeover.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to delete critical files can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution by deleting core files and replacing them with malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network.
- Attackers can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a manipulated filename to perform the file deletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint in the plugin used for handling file deletion.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.7.13 of the "Startklar Elementor Addons" plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.14
- The vulnerability was discovered by István Márton from Wordfence.
- The fix involved sanitizing the filename to prevent path traversal. The code changes involve using `sanitize_file_name` instead of `sanitize_text_field` for the filename and `sanitize_key` instead of `sanitize_text_field` for the hash value. A file type validation was also added via `wp_check_filetype`
