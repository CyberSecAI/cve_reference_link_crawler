# Detection: Splunk risky Command Abuse disclosed february 2023

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: ee69374a-d27e-4136-adac-956a96ff60fd
Author: Chase Franklin, Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Splunk
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies the execution of high-risk commands associated with various Splunk vulnerability disclosures. It leverages the Splunk\_Audit.Search\_Activity datamodel to detect ad-hoc searches by non-system users that match known risky commands. This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities within Splunk, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment, posing a severe threat to the organization's security posture.

### Search

### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_risky\_command\_abuse\_disclosed\_february\_2023\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_risky_command_abuse_disclosed_february_2023_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires implementation of Splunk\_Audit.Search\_Activity datamodel.

### Known False Positives

This search encompasses many commands.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use of risky splunk command $splunk\_risky\_command$ detected by $user$ | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
