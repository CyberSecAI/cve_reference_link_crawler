â€‹All versions of the TWinSoft Configuration Tool store encrypted passwords as plaintext in memory. An attacker with access to system files could open a file to load the document into memory, including sensitive information associated with document, such as password. The attacker could then obtain the plaintext password by using a memory viewer.
