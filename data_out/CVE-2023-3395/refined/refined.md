This document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-3395.

**CVE-2023-3395**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Plaintext storage of passwords. The TWinSoft Configuration Tool stores encrypted passwords as plaintext in memory.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passwords are not securely stored in memory.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to system files could open a file to load the document into memory and then obtain the plaintext password by using a memory viewer.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs access to system files and the ability to use a memory viewer.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires access to the system to load configuration files into memory and view the memory contents. A low privileged user can perform this action.
