  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2024-1488",
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. The default combination of the \"control-use-cert: no\" option with either explicit or implicit use of an IP address in the \"control-interface\" option could allow improper access. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged local process to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect default permissions in Unbound allowed unauthorized modification of the runtime configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect default permissions",
      "Unrestricted configuration access",
      "Missing certificate requirement for localhost control interface"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged local process can manipulate a running Unbound instance. This includes altering forwarders, tracking all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and disrupting resolving altogether.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local network access to port 8953",
      "Exploitation by an unprivileged process on the same system"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to run a process on the local system and have network access to the localhost on port 8953",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises when the 'control-use-cert' option is set to 'no' in combination with using an IP address for the 'control-interface'. This allows connections to the control interface without a certificate, meaning any process on the local system can connect to port 8953 and reconfigure unbound. Mitigation involves changing the default configuration to enforce certificate usage ('control-use-cert: yes') and using unix domain socket, ensuring that only members of the 'unbound' group can access the control interface."
