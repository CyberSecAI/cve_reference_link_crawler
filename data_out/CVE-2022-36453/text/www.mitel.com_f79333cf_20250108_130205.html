## Mitel Product Security Advisory 22-0006

### Mitel MiCollab Multiple Security Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: 22-0006

Publish Date: 2022-07-27

Last Updated: 2022-08-29

Revision: 3.0

### Summary

The following vulnerabilities were privately reported to Mitel.

A vulnerability has been identified in the web conferencing component of MiCollab which could allow upload of malicious files. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.

A vulnerability has been identified in the MiCollab Client server component of MiCollab which could allow a Server-Side Request Forgery attack. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to leverage connections and permissions available to the host server.

Credit is given to Shaquin Trifonoff of Lateral Security for highlighting these two issues and bringing to our attention.

A vulnerability has been identified in the MiCollab Client API component of MiCollab which could allow an authenticated attacker to control another extension number or allow an authenticated attacker to impersonate another user's name.

Mitel is recommending customers with affected product versions apply the available remediation.
