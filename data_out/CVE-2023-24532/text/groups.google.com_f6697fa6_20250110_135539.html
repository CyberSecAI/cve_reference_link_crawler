Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.20.2 and 1.19.7, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/elliptic: incorrect P-256 ScalarMult and ScalarBaseMult results

  The ScalarMult and ScalarBaseMult methods of the P256 Curve may return an

  incorrect result if called with some specific unreduced scalars (a scalar larger

  than the order of the curve).

  This does not impact usages of crypto/ecdsa or crypto/ecdh.

  Thanks to Guido Vranken for repoting this issue via the Ethereum Foundation bug

  bounty program.

  This is CVE-2023-24532 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/58647>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.2>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.20.2` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Carlos and Dmitri for the Go team
