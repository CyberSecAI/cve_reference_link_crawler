| We agreed with [@rolandshoemaker](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker) that this can be fixed as PUBLIC since it only affects niche configurations, namely very specific direct uses of crypto/elliptic. We found no real world protocol that could be attacked due to this. |

`[[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar](/golang/go/commit/602eeaab387f24a4b28c5eccbb50fa934f3bc3c4 "[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar

Unlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete
addition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the
correct value if the two inputs are equal.

This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops
because as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is
lower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.

As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing
the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption
that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.

Added a reduction, and while at it added it in P256OrdInverse, too, to
enforce a universal reduction invariant on p256OrdElement values.

Note that if the input point is the infinity, the code currently still
relies on undefined behavior, but that's easily tested to behave
acceptably, and will be addressed in a future CL.

Updates #58647
Fixes #58720
Fixes CVE-2023-24532

`[[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar](/TroutSoftware/go/commit/505b971f832d7f6987e5e7368001c88e8d677652 "[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar

Unlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete
addition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the
correct value if the two inputs are equal.

This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops
because as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is
lower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.

As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing
the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption
that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.

Added a reduction, and while at it added it in P256OrdInverse, too, to
enforce a universal reduction invariant on p256OrdElement values.

Note that if the input point is the infinity, the code currently still
relies on undefined behavior, but that's easily tested to behave
acceptably, and will be addressed in a future CL.

The assumptions of some of the assembly functions were still scarcely
documented and even disregarded: p256ScalarMult was relying on the fact
that the \"undefined behavior\" of p256PointAddAsm with regards to
infinity inputs was returning the infinity.

Aside from expanding comments, moving the bit window massaging into a
more easily understood p256OrdRsh function, and fixing the above, this
change folds the last iteration of p256ScalarMult into the loop to
reduce special cases and inverts the iteration order of p256BaseMult so
it matches p256ScalarMult for ease of comparison.

Switch Go from the one that the OSS-Fuzz image supplies via
`install_go.sh` to the latest development version cloned from Git.

The OSS-Fuzz Go is an older version which still has
[CVE-2023-24532](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58647) which keeps
getting found by the fuzzer. Additionaly by using the latest upstream
version, bugs in Go will be detected quickly after being introduced.

Additionally this PR fixes the 32 bit build. The 32 bit build is
currently not enabled on OSS-Fuzz because it leads to OOM bugs, but I
still like to build it myself for local testing.
