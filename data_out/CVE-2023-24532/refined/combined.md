Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.20.2 and 1.19.7, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/elliptic: incorrect P-256 ScalarMult and ScalarBaseMult results

  The ScalarMult and ScalarBaseMult methods of the P256 Curve may return an

  incorrect result if called with some specific unreduced scalars (a scalar larger

  than the order of the curve).

  This does not impact usages of crypto/ecdsa or crypto/ecdh.

  Thanks to Guido Vranken for repoting this issue via the Ethereum Foundation bug

  bounty program.

  This is CVE-2023-24532 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/58647>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.2>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.20.2` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Carlos and Dmitri for the Go team

| We agreed with [@rolandshoemaker](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker) that this can be fixed as PUBLIC since it only affects niche configurations, namely very specific direct uses of crypto/elliptic. We found no real world protocol that could be attacked due to this. |

`[[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar](/golang/go/commit/602eeaab387f24a4b28c5eccbb50fa934f3bc3c4 "[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/internal/nistec: reduce P-256 scalar

Unlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete
addition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the
correct value if the two inputs are equal.

This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops
because as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is
lower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.

As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing
the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption
that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.

Added a reduction, and while at it added it in P256OrdInverse, too, to
enforce a universal reduction invariant on p256OrdElement values.

Note that if the input point is the infinity, the code currently still
relies on undefined behavior, but that's easily tested to behave
acceptably, and will be addressed in a future CL.

Updates #58647
Fixes #58720
Fixes CVE-2023-24532

(Filed with the \"safe APIs like complete addition formulas are good\" dept.)

The assumptions of some of the assembly functions were still scarcely
documented and even disregarded: p256ScalarMult was relying on the fact
that the \"undefined behavior\" of p256PointAddAsm with regards to
infinity inputs was returning the infinity.

Aside from expanding comments, moving the bit window massaging into a
more easily understood p256OrdRsh function, and fixing the above, this
change folds the last iteration of p256ScalarMult into the loop to
reduce special cases and inverts the iteration order of p256BaseMult so
it matches p256ScalarMult for ease of comparison.

Updates #58647

| [@FiloSottile](https://github.com/FiloSottile) FYI <https://go.dev/cl/471256> caused a minor regression in one benchmark: <https://perf.golang.org/dashboard/?benchmark=GenerateKeyP256-8&unit=sec/op#commit778627f33187d874440ce1f353bb4d7bce55304a>  Given this is minor, part of a CVE fix, and presumably in a crypto microbenchmark, I don't think this matters much, just raising it in case you care.  The benchmark is <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/v1.10.9/crypto/ecies/ecies_test.go#L166>. |
