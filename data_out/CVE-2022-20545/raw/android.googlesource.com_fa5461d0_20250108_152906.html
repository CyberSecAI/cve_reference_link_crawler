            Fix crash when loading album art by resourceWhen the album art is loaded from the notification largeIcon it may be aresource rather than a bitmap, so it has to be loaded as a drawable.Bitmaps are still loaded using `WallpaperColors.fromBitmap` to avoidthe extra steps needed by the `fromDrawable` method.Fixes: 239368697Test: manualTest: atest MediaControlPanelTestChange-Id: I0ba9a4b0f4d308cc360a785b68cbabdcb2480690
