Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3516:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided document from synacktiv.com directly mentions CVE-2016-3516 and describes a vulnerability within the Oracle Enterprise Communications Broker. The vulnerability description aligns with the provided advisory which mentions that an attacker is able to retrieve sensitive files without being authenticated. Therefore, this content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient authentication check within the Oracle Enterprise Communications Broker's web interface. The authentication check is performed for `GET` requests, but is missing for `POST` requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Authentication Check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper authentication check when the HTTP verb is `POST`, allowing unauthenticated access to resources.
    *   **Insecure HTTP Methods:** The system relies on HTTP methods for access control instead of proper user sessions and authorization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download sensitive configuration files and log files that are typically accessible only to authenticated users.
    *   **Compromise of System Security:** Exposure of sensitive configuration details may allow further exploitation of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests with POST Method:** Attackers can send specifically crafted HTTP `POST` requests to the `/download/` and `/view/` directories.
    *   **Direct access to web interface:** An attacker who has network access to the administration console is able to exploit this issue.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Accessibility:** Attackers must be able to reach the Oracle Enterprise Communications Broker's web administration console over a network.
    *   **HTTP Manipulation:** Ability to send crafted HTTP POST requests.

**3. Additional Details:**

The Synacktiv advisory provides a clear technical explanation with a proof-of-concept, showing:

*   The intended functionality using `GET` requests with valid session identifiers.
*   The vulnerability by switching to a `POST` request, bypassing the session check.
*   Specific vulnerable directories: `/download/BACKUP_CONFIG/*`, `/download/LOGS/*.log`, and `/view/LOGS/*.log`.

This advisory offers much more detail than the basic CVE description. It outlines the exact mechanism of exploitation and provides concrete attack vectors.
