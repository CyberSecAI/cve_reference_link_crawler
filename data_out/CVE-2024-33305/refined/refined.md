- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Middle Name" field before storing it in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored persistently and executed when a user views the affected page. This can lead to account takeover by stealing session cookies, data theft, modification of the web page content, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to `/php-lms/classes/Users.php?f=save`.
    - The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "middlename" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. An attacker can achieve this by simply creating an account.
