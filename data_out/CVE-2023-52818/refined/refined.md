{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The code uses fixed-size arrays within structures that are intended to have variable sizes, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Array index out-of-bounds",
      "Incorrect use of fixed-size arrays for variable data"
    ],
    "impact": "UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer) reports array-index-out-of-bounds, which can cause unexpected behavior and potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by an attacker but it can be triggered by incorrect data processing or a misconfiguration, causing the driver to attempt to access memory beyond the array's boundaries.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed as it's a coding error. The error occurs during normal operations of the driver if incorrect power profile data is supplied or processed."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Replaced fixed-size arrays in structures with flexible array members, allowing for dynamic allocation of memory."
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability is triggered by using fixed size arrays for variable length data within the AMD GPU power management driver. Specifically, the ATOM_PPLIB_STATE, ATOM_PPLIB_STATE_V2, ATOM_Tonga_MCLK_Dependency_Table, and ATOM_Tonga_SCLK_Dependency_Table structs were defined with fixed size arrays for ucClockStateIndices, clockInfoIndex, and entries. The fix replaces these fixed size arrays with flexible array members."
