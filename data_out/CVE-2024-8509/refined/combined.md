| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2310406#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-06 12:56:56 UTC  ``` It was identified a security vulnerability against the API. No verification is being performed against the Authorization header except ensuring that it uses bearer authentication. For example, a malicious user can make a query against the API with a random string bearer token as shown below:  curl -vvvkL -H "Authorization: Bearer foobar" "https://<forklift_inventory_route_hostname>/providers"  Without a Authorization header and some form of Bearer token, a 401 is produced. However, the mere presence of a token value provides a 200 response with the requested information.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2310406#c1)  Fabian Deutsch    2024-09-09 09:43:23 UTC  ``` Moving to verified according to MTV-1422   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2310406#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 10:39:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Migration Toolkit for Virtualization 2.6  Via RHSA-2024:6487 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6487](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6487)   ``` |  |
