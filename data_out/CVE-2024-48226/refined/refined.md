The content is related to CVE-2024-48226.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `savefield` method in `funadmin\app\curd\controller\Table.php` directly concatenates the value of the `COLUMN_NAME` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database server.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/curd/table/savefield` with a malicious `COLUMN_NAME` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have backend administrator privileges.
    - They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.
