Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the "clear storage" dialog message is phrased in the Android Settings application. The commit message indicates a "rephrase dialog message of clear storage dialog for security concern". This suggests the original phrasing of the dialog message could potentially expose some user data or setting which was not considered ideal for security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure (ID): The vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure issue. The rephrasing of the clear storage dialog suggests that the original wording might have inadvertently revealed information about the user's data or settings to an attacker who can access the dialog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The potential impact of this vulnerability was information disclosure. While not directly causing code execution or privilege escalation, the information disclosed could potentially be used by an attacker for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve an attacker gaining access to a context where the "clear storage" dialog could be displayed and read. This implies a local attack vector where an attacker can interact with the device's UI or has the necessary privileges to read the dialog message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the device and be able to trigger and read the clear storage dialog, meaning the attacker could be an attacker that has compromised a user-level application or has physical access to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves rephrasing the dialog message to address the security concern.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 10, 11 and 12.
- The fix is available in AOSP with change IDs: `a36d55e8f83e8bf6e50254cda04632e233598f42` and `d2d3da3850d1eefd2a49dc93e1b6f953711a8902`.
