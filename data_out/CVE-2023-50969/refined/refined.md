Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50969

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Imperva SecureSphere WAF's improper handling of multiple `Content-Encoding` headers in HTTP POST requests. By including a crafted sequence of these headers, specifically a non-standard value followed by a valid encoding like `gzip` or `deflate`, attackers can bypass WAF rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parsing/handling of multiple `Content-Encoding` headers.
- WAF rule engine fails to properly inspect POST data when specific combinations of `Content-Encoding` headers are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful bypass of WAF rules that inspect POST data.
- Allows exploitation of vulnerabilities in protected web applications, such as remote code execution or SQL injection, that would normally be blocked by the WAF.
- Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to a vulnerable web application protected by Imperva SecureSphere WAF.
- The crafted request must contain:
    -  A `Content-Encoding` header with an arbitrary value.
    -  A subsequent `Content-Encoding` header with a valid value like `gzip` or `deflate`.
    - Optionally a throwaway POST parameter may be required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the protected web application.
- Knowledge of existing vulnerabilities in the protected web application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Imperva SecureSphere WAF v14.7.0.40.
- All versions of Imperva SecureSphere without the Application Defense Center (ADC) update released on February 26, 2024 are affected.
- Imperva Cloud WAF is not affected.
- The vulnerability can be remediated by applying the mentioned ADC rule update.
- A proof-of-concept example is provided using a PHP webshell demonstrating the successful bypass and command execution.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the targeted systems apart from network access.
