- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack exhaustion during JSON parsing due to deeply nested arrays.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `jsonxx` library's parsing logic for arrays does not limit recursion, leading to a stack overflow when parsing deeply nested JSON arrays. The `Object::parse`, `Value::parse`, and `Array::parse` functions are involved in the recursive calls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). The stack overflow will cause the application using the library to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted JSON string containing deeply nested arrays to be parsed by `jsonxx`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to an application using the vulnerable jsonxx library.
