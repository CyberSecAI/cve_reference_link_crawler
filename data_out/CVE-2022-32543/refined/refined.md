- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow during heap allocation size calculation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer overflow: A multiplication operation uses a 32-bit variable to store the result, causing an overflow.
    - Heap buffer overflow: Due to the integer overflow, a smaller than required memory buffer is allocated on the heap. Subsequent `memcpy` operations write beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted OLE file needs to be provided to trigger the vulnerability. The application processes this file and triggers the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious OLE file to the vulnerable software (ESTsoft Alyac). User interaction is required since the user needs to scan the file with the application.
