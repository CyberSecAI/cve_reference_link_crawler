The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in Tenda AX3 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `SetNetControlList` function in the Tenda AX3 firmware passes user-supplied data to the `sscanf` function without proper validation.
- The parsed data is then passed to the `add_Tc_Traffic_Control` function.
- Inside `add_Tc_Traffic_Control`, the data is further processed using `snprintf` which results in command injection through the `doSystemCommand` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation when processing the `list` parameter in `SetNetControlList`
- Use of `sscanf` and `snprintf` with user controlled data without sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution on the affected Tenda AX3 router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted `POST` request to `/goform/SetNetControlList` with a malicious `list` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have remote access to the router's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Tenda AX3 router.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- Basic understanding of HTTP and command injection techniques.
