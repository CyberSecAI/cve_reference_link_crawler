The provided content shows two commits related to session validation in FusionPBX. Both commits modify `core/authentication/resources/classes/authentication.php` and `resources/check_auth.php`.

**Commit 2f8bed3**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The session validation mechanism in `resources/check_auth.php` was missing a check to ensure the session was authorized before validating the user hash. This allowed unauthenticated users to trigger `session_destroy()` if their `$_SESSION['authorized']` was not set and the session was not authorized.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Session invalidation by unauthenticated users.
    *   Potential for denial of service due to repeated session destruction.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user could cause a denial of service by repeatedly accessing the application, causing session destruction.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could access any page that includes `resources/check_auth.php` without being logged in.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only requires network access to the application and does not need to be authenticated.

**Summary of Changes**

Both commits address the same vulnerability.  The changes include the following:

*   **`core/authentication/resources/classes/authentication.php`:**
    *   Added `$_SESSION["user"]["user_uuid"]`, `$_SESSION["user"]["username"]` and `$_SESSION["user"]["contact_uuid"]` to the session.
    *   Also, in commit `ee202cd`, `group->session()` is called to get the groups assigned to the user.

*   **`resources/check_auth.php`:**
    *   Added a check `if (!$_SESSION['authorized'])` inside the condition `if (!isset($_SESSION['authorized']) || (isset($_SESSION['authorized']) && !$_SESSION['authorized']))` to prevent session destruction when the session is not authorized.

These changes ensure that session destruction only occurs when there's an authorized session, preventing unauthenticated users from invalidating sessions.

The commits provide more details than the typical CVE description.
