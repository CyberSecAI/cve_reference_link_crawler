Package        : heimdal
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3671 CVE-2021-44758 CVE-2022-3437 CVE-2022-41916
                 CVE-2022-42898 CVE-2022-44640
Debian Bug     : 996586

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Heimdal, an implementation of
Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT Kerberos.

CVE-2021-3671

    Joseph Sutton discovered that the Heimdal KDC does not validate that
    the server name in the TGS-REQ is present before dereferencing,
    which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2021-44758

    It was discovered that Heimdal is prone to a NULL dereference in
    acceptors where an initial SPNEGO token that has no acceptable
    mechanisms, which may result in denial of service for a server
    application that uses SPNEGO.

CVE-2022-3437

    Several buffer overflow flaws and non-constant time leaks were
    discovered when using 1DES, 3DES or RC4 (arcfour).

CVE-2022-41916

    An out-of-bounds memory access was discovered when Heimdal
    normalizes Unicode, which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-42898

    It was discovered that integer overflows in PAC parsing may result
    in denial of service for Heimdal KDCs or possibly Heimdal servers.

CVE-2022-44640

    It was discovered that the Heimdal's ASN.1 compiler generates code
    that allows specially crafted DER encodings to invoke an invalid
    free on the decoded structure upon decode error, which may result in
    remote code execution in the Heimdal KDC.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.7.0+dfsg-2+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.

tracker page at:

Package        : heimdal
Version        : 7.5.0+dfsg-3+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14870 CVE-2021-3671 CVE-2021-44758 CVE-2022-3437
                 CVE-2022-41916 CVE-2022-42898 CVE-2022-44640
Debian Bug     : 946786 996586 1024187

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in heimdal, an
implementation of the Kerberos 5 authentication protocol, which may
result in denial of service, information disclosure, or remote code
execution.

CVE-2019-14870

    Isaac Boukris reported that the Heimdal KDC before 7.7.1 does not
    apply delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated) user attributes for
    S4U2Self.  Instead the forwardable flag is set even if the
    impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.

CVE-2021-3671

    Joseph Sutton discovered that the Heimdal KDC before 7.7.1 does not
    check for missing missing sname in TGS-REQ (Ticket Granting Server -
    Request) before before dereferencing.  An authenticated user could
    use this flaw to crash the KDC.

CVE-2021-44758

    It was discovered that Heimdal is prone to a NULL dereference in
    acceptors when the initial SPNEGO token has no acceptable
    mechanisms, which may result in denial of service for a server
    application that uses the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation
    Mechanism (SPNEGO).

CVE-2022-3437

    Evgeny Legerov reported that the DES and Triple-DES decryption
    routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library before 7.7.1 were prone to
    buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a
    maliciously small packet.  In addition, the Triple-DES and RC4
    (arcfour) decryption routine were prone to non-constant time leaks,
    which could potentially yield to a leak of secret key material when
    using these ciphers.

CVE-2022-41916

    It was discovered that Heimdal's PKI certificate validation library
    before 7.7.1 can under some circumstances perform an out-of-bounds
    memory access when normalizing Unicode, which may result in denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-42898

    Greg Hudson discovered an integer multiplication overflow in the
    Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) parsing routine, which may
    result in denial of service for Heimdal KDCs and possibly Heimdal
    servers (e.g., via GSS-API) on 32-bit systems.

CVE-2022-44640

    Douglas Bagnall and the Heimdal maintainers independently discovered
    that Heimdal's ASN.1 compiler before 7.7.1 generates code that
    allows specially crafted DER encodings of CHOICEs to invoke the
    wrong free() function on the decoded structure upon decode error,
    which may result in remote code execution in the Heimdal KDC and
    possibly the Kerberos client, the X.509 library, and other
    components as well.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.5.0+dfsg-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
