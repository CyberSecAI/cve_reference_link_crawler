Package        : heimdal
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3671 CVE-2021-44758 CVE-2022-3437 CVE-2022-41916
                 CVE-2022-42898 CVE-2022-44640
Debian Bug     : 996586

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Heimdal, an implementation of
Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT Kerberos.

CVE-2021-3671

    Joseph Sutton discovered that the Heimdal KDC does not validate that
    the server name in the TGS-REQ is present before dereferencing,
    which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2021-44758

    It was discovered that Heimdal is prone to a NULL dereference in
    acceptors where an initial SPNEGO token that has no acceptable
    mechanisms, which may result in denial of service for a server
    application that uses SPNEGO.

CVE-2022-3437

    Several buffer overflow flaws and non-constant time leaks were
    discovered when using 1DES, 3DES or RC4 (arcfour).

CVE-2022-41916

    An out-of-bounds memory access was discovered when Heimdal
    normalizes Unicode, which may result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-42898

    It was discovered that integer overflows in PAC parsing may result
    in denial of service for Heimdal KDCs or possibly Heimdal servers.

CVE-2022-44640

    It was discovered that the Heimdal's ASN.1 compiler generates code
    that allows specially crafted DER encodings to invoke an invalid
    free on the decoded structure upon decode error, which may result in
    remote code execution in the Heimdal KDC.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.7.0+dfsg-2+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.
