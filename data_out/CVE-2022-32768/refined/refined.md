Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE-2022-32768**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing authorization checks when handling object IDs in the AVideo application. Specifically, the application does not verify if the user requesting a modification of a live schedule owns the live schedule resource, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The application fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to modify a specific live schedule, allowing a user to modify schedules belonging to other users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can take over other users' live schedules, modify their settings, and effectively remove them from the original owner's view.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` endpoint with the ID of the target live schedule.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the permission to stream video.
    *   **Knowledge of Target ID:** The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the live schedule they want to take over. The IDs are sequential, making guessing trivial.

**Summary of CVE-2022-32768:**

This CVE describes an authentication bypass vulnerability related to live schedule management in the AVideo platform. By crafting specific HTTP requests with a valid user session, an attacker can take control of any live schedule without proper authorization checks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in a plugin that is disabled by default.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by implementing checks to ensure that the user modifying the live schedule is the owner of the schedule.
*  The provided `updateDb.v12.0.sql` file from GitHub outlines the fix by noting that the `plugin/Live/view/Live_schedule/add.json.php` will deny updates if the user ID is not the same as the original record being edited.
