### Description

The Multiple Page Generator Plugin – MPG plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of and access to data due to a missing capability check on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to invoke those functions intended for admin use resulting in subscribers being able to upload csv files and view the contents of MPG projects.
