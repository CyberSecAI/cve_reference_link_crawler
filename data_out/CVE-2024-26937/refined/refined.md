  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the preempt-to-busy mechanism of the Intel i915 graphics driver. When a request is preempted and completed before the preemption is fully processed by the hardware, the queue_priority_hint may remain set to a value higher than INT_MIN, preventing direct submission of the next request until the next command stream interrupt is processed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Incorrect state management during preemption"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to a GEM_BUG_ON assertion failure in __engine_park function.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Triggering preempt-to-busy scenario, possibly through a heartbeat event acting as a power management barrier."
