The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the `setWanIeCfg` function of the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` file in TOTOLINK X5000r devices with firmware versions up to v9.1.0cu.2350_b20230313.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of parameters `staticIp`, `staticMask`, and `staticGw` before passing them to the `Uci_set_str` function, which then uses `snprintf` to format these parameters into a string that is eventually executed via `execv`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with crafted values for `staticIp`, `staticMask`, and `staticGw`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web interface to send the malicious POST request.
