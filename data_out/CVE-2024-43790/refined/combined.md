# heap-buffer-overflow in do\_search() in Vim > 9.1.0425 and Vim < 9.1.0689

Moderate

## Package

vim

## Affected versions

Version > v9.1.0425 and Version < v9.1.0689

## Patched versions

v9.1.0689

## Description

# heap-buffer-overflow in do\_search() in Vim < 9.1.0689

=====================================================

**Date:** 22.08.2024

**Severity:** Low

**CVE:** CVE-2024-43790

**CWE:** Heap-based buffer overlow (CWE-122)

### Summary

heap-buffer-overflow in do\_search() in Vim < 9.1.0689

### Impact

When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is

disabled (`:set shm+=S`), the search pattern is displayed at the bottom

of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf).

When right-left mode (`:set rl`) is enabled, the search pattern is

reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern

contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller

than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed

buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it

notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is

wrong.

This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by

the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. Therefore, one must

recalculate the length of the msgbuf after is has been re-allocated.

Impact is low since it requires the search count functionality to be off

(which may happen) and at the same time `:set rightleft` must have been

used, which seems to be a rarely used feature and the search pattern

must include some ASCII NUL bytes. But when this happens, this will

cause a crash.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting

this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689

### Update

*24.08.2024*: This issue has been introduced with patch [v9.1.0426](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8c85a2a49acf80e4f53ec51e6ff2a5f3830eeddb) and therefore only Vim

versions > v9.1.0425 and < v9.1.0689 are effected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

The search pattern cannot contain NUL characters. It seems that the actual problem here is that in `ex_substitute()` the `patlen` variable is assigned before finding the end delimiter, causing it to be larger than the pattern length. If it's assigned after that then this change in `do_search()` won't be needed:

I still think updating msgbuflen after the msgbuf has been re-allocated is a good thing to do here (and I also checked other places of reverse\_text). So I think this is good. Might make sense to assign the patlen() variable as well as a separate patch however

I can't suggest a change to the advisory through the GitHub UI, but it looks like this was only introduced at [8c85a2a#diff-d5920a54fc6fff9b49052b09ca50c0608cf55cc93b5a46713bf8a4de1132eed0L1451](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8c85a2a49acf80e4f53ec51e6ff2a5f3830eeddb#diff-d5920a54fc6fff9b49052b09ca50c0608cf55cc93b5a46713bf8a4de1132eed0L1451) (v9.1.0426).

Before that change, `STRLEN` was being called for `msgbuf`.

The advisory says all versions below `v9.1.0689` are affected, but it should say that anything below `v9.1.0426` is not affected.

So effectively, the range of affected versions would be `>= v9.1.0426, <v9.1.0689`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
