Problem:  buffer-overflow in do_search() with 'rightleft'

The search pattern cannot contain NUL characters. It seems that the actual problem here is that in `ex_substitute()` the `patlen` variable is assigned before finding the end delimiter, causing it to be larger than the pattern length. If it's assigned after that then this change in `do_search()` won't be needed:

I still think updating msgbuflen after the msgbuf has been re-allocated is a good thing to do here (and I also checked other places of reverse\_text). So I think this is good. Might make sense to assign the patlen() variable as well as a separate patch however

I can't suggest a change to the advisory through the GitHub UI, but it looks like this was only introduced at [8c85a2a#diff-d5920a54fc6fff9b49052b09ca50c0608cf55cc93b5a46713bf8a4de1132eed0L1451](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8c85a2a49acf80e4f53ec51e6ff2a5f3830eeddb#diff-d5920a54fc6fff9b49052b09ca50c0608cf55cc93b5a46713bf8a4de1132eed0L1451) (v9.1.0426).

Before that change, `STRLEN` was being called for `msgbuf`.

The advisory says all versions below `v9.1.0689` are affected, but it should say that anything below `v9.1.0426` is not affected.

So effectively, the range of affected versions would be `>= v9.1.0426, <v9.1.0689`.
