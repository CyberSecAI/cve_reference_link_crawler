# Detection: Splunk Unauthorized Notification Input by User

**EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION**

This detection status is set to experimental. The Splunk Threat Research team has not yet fully tested, simulated, or built comprehensive datasets for this detection. As such, this analytic is not officially supported. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at research@splunk.com.

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 4b7f368f-4322-47f8-8363-2c466f0b7030
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This hunting search provides information to track possible exploitation of a lower privilege user able to push notifications that may include malicious code as notifications for all users in Splunk.

### Search

```
1
2| rest /services/messages
3| table title message severity timeCreated_iso published splunk_server author
4| `splunk_unauthorized_notification_input_by_user_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |

| splunk\_unauthorized\_notification\_input\_by\_user\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_unauthorized_notification_input_by_user_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.
### Annotations

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to Splunk rest data.

### Known False Positives

This search will produce false positives which may include benign notifications from other Splunk entities, attention to suspicious or anomalous elements in notifications helps identify actual exploitation of this vulnerability.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Please review messages at $splunk\_server for possible unauthorized notification input. | 20 | 20 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
