Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `firstname` parameter within the `/admin/admin_user.php` file of the Church Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query through the `firstname` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive user and system data by querying the database with malicious SQL commands.
*   **Compromised System Security:** The ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries can lead to full system compromise, depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to the `/admin/admin_user.php` file by manipulating the `firstname` parameter value.
*   **Payload Example:** `firstname=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(8)%2C0))XOR'Z` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection technique.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `firstname` parameter in `/admin/admin_user.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided payload demonstrates a time-based SQL injection, which is often used to infer data when the database output is not directly visible in the HTTP response.
*   The vulnerable software is "Campcodes Church Management System" version 1.0 or below.
