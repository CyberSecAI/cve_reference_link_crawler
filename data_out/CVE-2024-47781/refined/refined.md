Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the 'sitename' parameter when displaying requested wikis on the `Special:RequestWikiQueue` page. Specifically, the sitename was not HTML-escaped before being rendered on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized sitename allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser session.
-  The provided information references both CWE-79 and CWE-80. CWE-79 refers to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in a web page (Cross-site Scripting), while CWE-80 refers to improper neutralization of  HTML mark-up.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser session by crafting a malicious sitename.
- **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker could potentially hijack the user's session to access data they shouldn't be able to.
- **Access to Sensitive Information:** Specifically mentioned is the possibility of retrieving deleted wiki requests containing private information and the ability to view suppressed requests and sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a network.
- **Malicious Sitename:** The attacker can inject malicious script into the requested wiki sitename, which would then be displayed on the `Special:RequestWikiQueue` page.
- **Exploitation through Wiki Creation Requests**: An attacker can create a wiki request with a malicious sitename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability since it is related to a wiki request. The attacker needs to have the ability to request a wiki.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited, as the injected script will execute automatically upon page load.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was patched by escaping all plain text values on the `Special:RequestWikiQueue` page. The patch specifically HTML-escapes the `cw_sitename` value, preventing the injection of malicious code.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.6, indicating a high severity.
- **Affected Versions:** The affected versions are those after commit `44a37c3c6c883ae7ce42189f3d7cd35127aa744a` and before the patch.
- **Patched Versions**: The patched version is commit `693a220f399ee7eb4d00e77c3c667e864b1bd306`
- **Workarounds:** Disabling JavaScript or preventing access to the `Special:RequestWikiQueue` page can mitigate the risk before patching.
