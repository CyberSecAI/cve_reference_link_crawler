Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `admin-manage-user.php` file of the "php task management system free download."
- Specifically, on line 22, user input from the `_GET` element is retrieved.
- This user-provided value is directly passed into a database query on line 26 without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive database information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has elevated privileges (DBA), attackers could potentially gain control over the server host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `admin-manage-user.php`.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `admin_id` parameter in the GET request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable script (`admin-manage-user.php`) and the exploitable parameter (`admin_id`).

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `admin-manage-user.php`
- **Software Link:** The content includes a link to download the vulnerable software: `https://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/download/mayuri_k/taskmatic.zip`
- **Payload Example:** The content provides a sample SQL injection payload: `admin-manage-user.php?delete_user=1&admin_id=1%20AND%20(SELECT%20a%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(10)))U)`
- **Demonstration of Exploit:**  The payload uses `SLEEP(10)` to demonstrate a successful SQL injection, with a delay observed upon execution.
