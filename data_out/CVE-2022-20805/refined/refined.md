Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information found in the provided documents:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20805

**Vulnerability Title:** Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway File Decryption Bypass Vulnerability

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) decryption function uses the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTPS request. The SWG uses the SNI to discover the destination domain and determine if the request should be decrypted.

**Weakness:**
The system incorrectly relies on the SNI for determining if decryption is needed. This allows an attacker to craft a TLS request that bypasses the decryption process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the SWG's SSL decryption and content filtering policies. This could allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network without being inspected by the security mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** An attacker on the same network segment as the affected SWG instance can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafted TLS Request:**  The attacker must send a specifically crafted TLS request from a client to an unknown or attacker-controlled URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the adjacent network.
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Cisco Umbrella SWG instance.
- **Ability to craft TLS request:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted TLS request to an unknown or controlled URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the cloud-based Cisco Umbrella SWG.
- Cisco is addressing the vulnerability on their cloud platform, requiring no user action.
- A workaround is available using the Cisco Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) user guide, which involves creating rules to block traffic that could bypass SSL decryption and content filtering.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 4.1
- Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

**CWE:** CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure)

**Workaround:**
- Create destination lists to control identity access to websites.
- Create a ruleset in the web policy.
- Create a block rule within the ruleset, using the created destination lists to specify traffic to be blocked.

**Mitigation:**
- Cisco plans to address this vulnerability in Cisco Umbrella SWG, which is cloud based. No user action is required.

**Exploitation:**
- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
