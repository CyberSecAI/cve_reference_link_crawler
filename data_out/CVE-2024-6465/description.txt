The WP Links Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wplf_ajax_update_screenshots' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to regenerate the link's thumbnail image.
