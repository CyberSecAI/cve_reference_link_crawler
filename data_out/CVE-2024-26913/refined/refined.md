The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the AMD display driver, specifically addressing an underflow/corruption issue that can occur in DCN35 when using 8k30 resolution. This issue stems from a missing ODM (Output Display Manager) calculation when determining the pipe split policy.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the issue is the missing ODM calculation for pipe split policy determination in the AMD display driver, which leads to an underflow/corruption issue specifically affecting 8k30 resolution on DCN35 hardware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper calculation of display parameters in the `dml2_translation_helper.c` file
- Missing consideration for ODM in pipe split policy determination.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Underflow/Corruption issues on screen, specifically when using 8k30 resolution on DCN35 hardware.

**Attack vectors:**
- This is a software bug and not exploitable via an external attack vector, it would occur through normal system operation using specific display configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Not applicable, this is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability, but rather a software bug in the graphics driver.

The patch addresses this by adding the necessary ODM calculation, specifically by creating a temporary pipe context, copying the relevant pipe parameters to it, and calling `resource_build_scaling_params` to calculate the necessary parameters, rather than attempting to accumulate the values from multiple pipes.
