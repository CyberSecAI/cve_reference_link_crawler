Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-47902:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The web server of affected devices does not authenticate GET requests that execute specific commands (such as `ping`) on operating system level.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Missing authentication for critical functions. Specifically, GET requests to execute OS-level commands are not authenticated.
*   This allows an attacker to execute commands directly on the operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute specific commands on the OS level of the device, potentially leading to:
    *   Limited compromise of confidentiality
    *   Limited compromise of integrity

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote attack through network access via unauthenticated GET requests to the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated GET requests to the web server of the affected devices.
*   No specific position is needed beyond network access.

**Additional details:**
*   This vulnerability, in combination with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-47901, CVE-2024-47903, CVE-2024-47904) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   The vulnerable command mentioned in the document is `ping`.
