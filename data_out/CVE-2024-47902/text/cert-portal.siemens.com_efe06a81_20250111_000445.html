GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

InterMesh is a wireless alarm reporting system that uses advanced mesh radio network technology for fast and reliable alarm signal delivery.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47901

The web server of affected devices does not sanitize the input parameters in specific GET requests that allow for code execution on operating system level. In combination with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-47902, CVE-2024-47903, CVE-2024-47904) this could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
