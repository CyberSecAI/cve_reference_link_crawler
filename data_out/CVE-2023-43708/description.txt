Os Commerce is currently susceptible to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
This vulnerability allows attackers to inject JS through the "configuration_title[1](MODULE_PAYMENT_SAGE_PAY_SERVER_TEXT_TITLE)" parameter,
potentially leading to unauthorized execution of scripts within a user's web browser.
