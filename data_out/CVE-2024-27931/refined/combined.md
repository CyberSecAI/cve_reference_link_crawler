# Insufficient permission checking in `Deno.makeTemp\*` APIs

Moderate

Mar 5, 2024

## Package

Deno

## Affected versions

< 1.41.1

## Patched versions

1.41.1

## Description

### Impact

Insufficient validation of parameters in `Deno.makeTemp*` APIs would allow for creation of files outside of the allowed directories. This may allow the user to overwrite important files on the system that may affect other systems.

A user may provide a prefix or suffix to a `Deno.makeTemp*` API containing path traversal characters. The permission check would prompt for the base directory of the API, but the final file that was created would be outside of this directory:

```
$ mkdir /tmp/good
$ mkdir /tmp/bad
$ deno repl --allow-write=/tmp/good
> Deno.makeTempFileSync({ dir: "/tmp/bad" })
┌ ⚠️  Deno requests write access to "/tmp/bad".
├ Requested by `Deno.makeTempFile()` API.
├ Run again with --allow-write to bypass this prompt.
└ Allow? [y/n/A] (y = yes, allow; n = no, deny; A = allow all write permissions) > n
❌ Denied write access to "/tmp/bad".
Uncaught PermissionDenied: Requires write access to "/tmp/bad", run again with the --allow-write flag
    at Object.makeTempFileSync (ext:deno_fs/30_fs.js:176:10)
    at <anonymous>:1:27
> Deno.makeTempFileSync({ dir: "/tmp/good", prefix: "../bad/" })
"/tmp/good/../bad/a9432ef5"
$ ls -l /tmp/bad/a9432ef5
-rw-------@ 1 user  group  0 Mar  4 09:20 /tmp/bad/a9432ef5

```
### Patches

This is fixed in Deno 1.41.1.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
