- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request leading to the request being treated as both a single request and two separate requests by Next.js. This desynchronization leads to response queue poisoning.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444), Response queue poisoning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Response queue poisoning, potentially leading to malicious modification of responses.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks using crafted HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be able to send network requests to the affected Next.js server. The affected route also had to be using the `rewrites` feature in Next.js.
