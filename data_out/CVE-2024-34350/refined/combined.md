# HTTP Request Smuggling

High

[jackwilson323](/jackwilson323)
published
GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf
May 9, 2024

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=13.4 <13.5.1

## Patched versions

>=13.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions.

For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js.

### Patches

The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer. This includes Next.js `14.x`.

### Workarounds

There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend that you upgrade to a safe version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
