Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-0502:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a double-free error in Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Double-free vulnerability:  This occurs when memory that has already been freed is freed again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Flash Player process.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability could also lead to a crash or denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious SWF files: Attackers can embed the exploit within a specially crafted SWF file.
- Web Browsing: The victim's browser loads the malicious SWF, often through compromised or malicious websites, or by being embedded in malicious ads.
- Downloaded GIF Files:  The initial SWF exploit downloads a GIF file containing encrypted shellcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious SWF to a user. This can be achieved through various means including watering hole attacks and malicious advertisements.
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious SWF file and associated payload files (logo.gif in this case) on a web server.
- No user interaction is needed besides visiting the compromised website or viewing malicious content.

**Additional Technical Details (from volatility-labs.blogspot.com):**
- The exploit uses a multi-stage shellcode decryption process.
    - Stage 1: Swaps bytes in the shellcode block
    - Stage 2: Transforms bytes using subtraction and bit-shifting
    - Stage 3: Swaps bytes again
    - Stage 4: XOR's bytes with 0x31
- After decryption, the shellcode searches for a specific marker (0x31123112 in little-endian) in the downloaded GIF file to locate the encrypted URL of the backdoor executable.
- The URL is then decrypted by XOR'ing each byte with 0x12 and then subtracting 0x31.
- The shellcode uses the FPU to find the base address.

**Affected Products:**
- Adobe Flash Player (various versions before the fix)
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3
- openSUSE 11.4, 12.3, 13.1
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 & 6 Supplementary.

**Note:** The vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities addressed in the same update (APSB14-07) including CVE-2014-0498 and CVE-2014-0499.
