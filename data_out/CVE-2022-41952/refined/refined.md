    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Synapse's URL preview functionality did not properly limit connection times when attempting to generate previews for media stream URLs. The connections were only terminated after downloading a certain size of data, leading to potential long-lived connections with streaming media servers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
         "Lack of proper timeout mechanism for URL preview connections.",
         "Failure to validate the content type of the URL before attempting to generate a preview."
      ],
      "impact": "Excessive traffic and connections towards streaming media servers. An attacker could cause a denial of service to the media server if a stream URL is posted to a large room with many Synapse instances using URL preview functionality.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could post a URL pointing to a streaming media server into a Matrix room that is being viewed by multiple Synapse instances, thereby triggering those servers to attempt to generate a preview for the stream.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to post messages containing URLs into a Matrix room. The attacker does not need to have control over the Synapse server itself. They also do not need to have access to the media server directly beyond the ability to post a link to it."
