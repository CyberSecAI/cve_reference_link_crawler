The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47305.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `sync_file_merge` function within the Linux kernel's dma-buf subsystem. Specifically, when merging sync files, the function uses `dma_fence_get()` to acquire references to fences. However, in certain error paths (specifically `krealloc_array` or `sync_file_set_fence` failure), these references were not released by calling `dma_fence_put()`, leading to a memory leak. Additionally, the allocated `fences` array was not being freed in some error cases.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak of `dma_fence` objects
- Memory leak of the `fences` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated triggering of the merge failure could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a situation where the `sync_file_merge` function fails during the fence merging process, leading to a memory leak. This could involve providing a large number of fences to merge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the `sync_file_merge` function with conditions leading to a failure (either during fence allocation or while setting the fence). This typically involves interaction with the dma-buf subsystem which usually happens within a process that is creating a dma-buf.
