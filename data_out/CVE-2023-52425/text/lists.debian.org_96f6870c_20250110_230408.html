Package        : expat
Version        : 2.2.6-2+deb10u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-52425
Debian Bug     : 1063238

Expat, an XML parsing C library has been found to have an vulnerability
that allows an attacker to perform a denial of service (resource
consumption, when many full reparsings are required in the case of a
large tokens.

When parsing a really big token that requires multiple buffer fills to
complete, expat has to re-parse the token from start multiple times,
which takes time. These patches introduce a heuristic that, when having
failed on the same token multiple times, defers further parsing until
there's significantly more data available.

The patch also introduces an optiional API,
XML_SetReparseDeferralEnabled(), to disable the new heuristic.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.2.6-2+deb10u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.
