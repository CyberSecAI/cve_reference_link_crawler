- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions in IntelÂ® Server Debug and Provisioning (SDP) Tool software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper default permissions that allow an authenticated user to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privileges, which could allow an attacker to gain higher levels of access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed, and must have local access. Additionally, the attacker needs to interact with the system to trigger the vulnerability.
