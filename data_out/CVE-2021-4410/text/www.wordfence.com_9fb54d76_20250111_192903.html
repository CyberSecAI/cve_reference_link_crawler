### Description

The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save\_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
