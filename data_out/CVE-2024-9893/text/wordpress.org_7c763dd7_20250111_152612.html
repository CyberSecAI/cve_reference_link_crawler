## Description

Nextend Social Login is a professional, easy to use and free WordPress plugin. It lets your visitors register and login to your site using their social profiles (Facebook, Google, X (formerly Twitter), etc.) instead of forcing them to spend valuable time to fill out the default registration form. Besides that, they don’t need to wait for validation emails or keep track of their username and password anymore.

> [Demo](https://try-nextend-social-login.nextendweb.com/wp-login.php) | [Tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buPTza2-6xc&list=PLSawiBnEUNftt3EDqnP2jIXeh6q0pZ5D8&index=1) | [Docs](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/documentation/) | [Support](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/nextend-social-login-support/) | [Pro Addon](https://nextendweb.com/social-login/)

Nextend Social Login seamlessly integrates with your existing WordPress login and registration form. Existing users can add or remove their social accounts at their WordPress profile page. A single user can attach as many social account as they want allowing them to log in with Facebook, Google or X (formerly Twitter).

## FAQ

### Can I make my site GDPR compliant with Nextend Social Login installed?

Sure, Nextend Social Login provides you the tools to make your site GDPR compliant. [Check out the Nextend Social Login GDPR documentation](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/gdpr/) to learn more about the topic.

### 1. Where does Nextend Social Login display the social login buttons?

The free version of Nextend Social Login displays the social login buttons automatically on the /wp-login.php’s login form and all forms made using the wp\_login\_form action.

You can use Nextend Social Login’s widget and shortcodes if you need to display the buttons anywhere. If you need to publish the login buttons in your theme, you can use the [PHP code](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/theme-developer/).

### 2. How can I get the email address from the X (formerly Twitter) users?

After you set up your APP go to the Settings tab and enter the URL of your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy page. Then hit the Update your settings button. Then go to the Permissions tab and check the “Request email addresses from users” under “Additional Permissions”. [There’s a documentation](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/provider-twitter/#get-email) that explains the process with screenshots.

### 3. Why are random usernames generated?

When a user tries to register with a social account, Nextend Social Login will try to generate a username from the name that comes from the provider. If this name contains special characters, then we won’t be able to generate a username that is valid for WordPress, as WordPress doesn’t allow special characters in usernames either.

For this reason we will need to generate a unique and random username for the registered account.

In the Pro Addon it’s possible to ask an username if we can not generate a valid username, so you can avoid random usernames.

### 4. What should I do when I experience any problems?

[Contact us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/nextend-social-login-support/) via email and explain the issue you have.

### 5. How can I translate the plugin?

Find the `.pot` file at the /languages folder. From that you can start the translation process. [Drop us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/nextend-social-login-support/) the final `.po` and `.mo` files and we’ll put them to the next releases.

### 6. I have a feature request…

That’s awesome! [Contact us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/nextend-social-login-support/) and let’s discuss the details.

### 7. Does Nextend Social Login work with BuddyPress?

Nextend Social Login Free version does not have BuddyPress specific settings and the login buttons will not appear there. However your users will still be able login and register at the normal WordPress login page. Then when logged in they can use every BuddyPress feature their current user role have access to.

Using the Pro Addon you can set where the login buttons should appear on the Register form and how they should look like.

Works really well, and it’s easy to get started even if the process with Google is a bit long, there is good documentation. Good consistency between the free and paid versions.
