- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the reference count of shared memory objects. The code uses a signed `int` for the reference count which can be overflowed by a malicious client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the Wayland compositor.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client creates a large number of references to shared memory objects causing the integer reference counter to overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be a client interacting with the Wayland compositor.
