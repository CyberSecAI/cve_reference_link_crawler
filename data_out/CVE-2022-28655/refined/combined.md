## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)
* [Ubuntu 21.10](/security/notices?release=impish)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Muqing Liu and neoni discovered that Apport incorrectly handled detecting

if an executable was replaced after a crash. A local attacker could

possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as the root user.

([CVE-2021-3899](/security/CVE-2021-3899))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled connections to

Apport sockets inside containers. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to connect to arbitrary sockets as the root user. ([CVE-2022-1242](/security/CVE-2022-1242))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled user settings

files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2022-28652](/security/CVE-2022-28652))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of logging

from D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

fill up the Apport log file, leading to denial of service. ([CVE-2022-28654](/security/CVE-2022-28654))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not filter D-Bus connection

strings. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to

make arbitrary network connections. ([CVE-2022-28655](/security/CVE-2022-28655))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of memory

being consumed during D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly

use this issue to cause Apport to consume memory, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2022-28656](/security/CVE-2022-28656))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not disable the python crash

handler before chrooting into a container. A local attacker could possibly

use this issue to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-28657](/security/CVE-2022-28657))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled filename argument

whitespace. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof

arguments to the Apport daemon. ([CVE-2022-28658](/security/CVE-2022-28658))
