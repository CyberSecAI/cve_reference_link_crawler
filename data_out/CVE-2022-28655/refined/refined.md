- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Apport did not filter D-Bus connection strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper filtering of D-Bus connection strings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could cause Apport to make arbitrary network connections.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating D-Bus connection strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local to the system.
