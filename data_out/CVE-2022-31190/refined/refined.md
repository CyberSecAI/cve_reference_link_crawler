Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31190

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The DSpace XMLUI METS generator and ORE generator did not check if the current user had READ permissions on an item before generating metadata. This allowed unauthorized users to access metadata of withdrawn items via the `mets.xml` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The METS and ORE generators failed to verify user permissions, leading to information disclosure.
- **Information Exposure:** Metadata of withdrawn items was accessible without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to item metadata, including potentially sensitive information.
- The impact is considered low because item metadata typically doesn't contain highly sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to the `mets.xml` endpoint via a URL.
- The attacker needs to know the handle/URL of the withdrawn item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the handle/URL of the withdrawn item.
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability affects anonymous users.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by adding permission checks to the `DSpaceMETSGenerator` and `DSpaceOREGenerator` to ensure the current user has READ access to the object before metadata generation.
- The fix was implemented in DSpace version 6.4 and is available as a patch for 6.x versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by David Cavrenne of Atmire.
- The vulnerability only affects DSpace XMLUI and does not impact JSPUI or DSpace 7.x.
- A workaround is to permanently delete items with highly secure metadata.
