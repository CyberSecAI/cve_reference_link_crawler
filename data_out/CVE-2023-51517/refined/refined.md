- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress does not validate redirect URLs, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious link with a non-validated redirect URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious redirect and trick a user to click on it. This does not seem to require any specific user role/privilege on the WordPress site other than being able to interact with a crafted link.
