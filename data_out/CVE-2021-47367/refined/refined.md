The provided content describes a fix for a page leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's virtio-net driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When the `page_to_skb()` function in `drivers/net/virtio_net.c` attempts to create an sk_buff using `build_skb()` in "big mode", it fails to release unused pages chained via the `private` field of the `page` structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Unused pages are not released, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if triggered repeatedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `page_to_skb()` function in the virtio-net driver in "big mode" when there's sufficient tailroom. This likely happens when the driver is processing network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to send network traffic to a guest operating system that uses the virtio-net driver, and manipulate the conditions to trigger the vulnerable code path.
