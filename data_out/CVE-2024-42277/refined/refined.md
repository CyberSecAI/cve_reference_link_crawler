The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42277.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `sprd_iommu_cleanup` function within the `drivers/iommu/sprd-iommu.c` file. Specifically, the code attempts to access `dom->sdev` after setting it to NULL, before calling `sprd_iommu_hw_en()` which then dereferences the now NULL `dom->sdev`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The `sprd_iommu_cleanup` function sets `dom->sdev` to `NULL` and then attempts to access `dom->sdev` when calling `sprd_iommu_hw_en`, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash due to a null pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the cleanup phase of the IOMMU domain, which is a normal operation and would be reached by normal use of the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special attacker position or capabilities are needed. Any user interacting with the system would eventually trigger this cleanup function, causing the crash.
