# DPA 2023.2.100 release notes

Release date: July 18, 2023

Here's what's new in Database Performance Analyzer 2023.2.100.

**Learn more**

* See [DPA 2023.2.100 system requirements](../system_requirements/dpa_2023-2-100_system_requirements.htm) to learn about prerequisites for running and installing DPA 2023.2.100.
* See the [DPA 2023.2.100 Administrator Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/archive/pdf/DPA/DPAAdministratorGuide_2023-2-100.pdf) to learn how to work with DPA.
## New features and improvements in DPA

### Additions to supported platforms and monitored instances

DPA 202.3.2.100 adds support for the following:

* The DPA repository database can be created on Amazon Aurora for MySQL-compatible 8.0.
* DPA can monitor the following database instances:

  + PostgreSQL 15
  + Postgres EDB 15
  + Amazon Aurora for MySQL-compatible 8.0

See the [End of support](#End) section for information on removals. For information about all supported platforms and instances, see the [System requirements](../system_requirements/dpa_2023-2-100_system_requirements.htm) and [Database instances DPA can monitor](../dpa-database-versions-you-can-monitor.htm).

### Changes to resource metrics categories

In previous versions, the License Compliance tab displayed metrics related to the number of cores used and the number of connections (connected devices, users, and sessions).

DPA 2023.2.100 no longer includes the License Compliance tab. To categorize the information more clearly, metrics related to the number of connections are displayed on the Connections tab. The Core Count metric is displayed on the CPU tab.

### New log file for DPA Central

The following file includes log entries that can help troubleshoot issues with DPA Central:

`DPA-Install-Dir\iwc\tomcat\logs\central.log`

## Fixes

| Case number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 01318760, 01174998, 01179091 | Index advisors for Oracle database instances no longer recommend creating an index that already exists, and they do not provide index creation scripts that include table columns that do not exist. |
| N/A | DPA no longer runs out of memory when monitoring a PostgreSQL instance that is running large queries. |
| 01312350 | When you create an Oracle repository database, the privileged user (which creates the DPA repository user) no longer requires the UNLIMITED\_TABLESPACE privilege. The privileged user must be granted QUOTA UNLIMITED on the tablespace where DPA will store performance data. |
| 01333338 | Previous versions of DPA did not consistently convert the display name to uppercase when connection information for a monitored SQL Server instance changed. Failure to convert the display name to uppercase caused connection issues.  DPA now consistently converts the display name to uppercase. |
| 00111644, 00221947, 01270821 | DPA 2023.2.100 does not use any of the deprecated `SNAP*` functions previously used to collect information from Db2 instances. These functions were causing IBM Db2 instances to have intermittent connection issues.  Because of this change:   * On the Real Time Sessions page, the Sessions tab no longer displays the following columns:    + INPUT\_DB\_ALIAS   + CLIENT\_DB\_ALIAS   + DB\_NAME * On the Real Time Sessions page, the Locking tab no longer displays the DB\_NAME column. * When you upgrade to DPA 2023.2.100 or later, you must update the permissions of the DPA monitoring user for each Db2 instance. See [Before you upgrade](#Before) for details. |
| N/A | When a user with read-only privileges accesses the Reports page, the user can view reports as expected. An error message is not displayed, and the option to create a report is not enabled. |
| N/A | This release includes security enhancements. |

### SolarWinds CVEs

SolarWinds would like to thank our Security Researchers below for reporting on the issue in a responsible manner and working with our security, product, and engineering teams to fix the vulnerability.

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Before you upgrade!

Before you upgrade, review the following sections to ensure continuous monitoring and accessibility.

### Upgrading from DPA 2023.1 or earlier

If you are upgrading from a version earlier than DPA 2023.2.1, be aware that for security purposes, DPA 2023.2.1 and later no longer supports HTTP connections. Before you upgrade:

* To ensure that DPA is available to users who previously connected over HTTP, follow the instructions under [Redirect connection attempts that use the HTTP connector port](dpa_2023-2-1_release_notes.htm#Redirect) in the DPA 2023.2.1 Release Notes.
* If you use [DPA Central](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/dpa/content/dpa-set-up-a-central-server.htm), ensure that it is configured to connect to all DPA servers over HTTPS. Follow the instructions under [Update DPA Central connections to DPA servers](dpa_2023-2-1_release_notes.htm#Update) in the DPA 2023.2.1 Release Notes.

### Update the permissions of the DPA monitoring user for each Db2 instance with privileges required for DPA 2023.2.100

If you monitor IBM Db2 database instances, DPA 2023.2.100 requires additional privileges to collect information from updated Db2 dictionaries and stored procedures.

DPA 2023.2.100 replaces the remaining deprecated `SNAP*` functions that were still present in DPA 2023.2.1. Previous DPA versions used these functions to monitor Db2 database instances. Because of this change, the DPA monitoring user requires additional privileges to collect information from updated Db2 dictionaries and stored procedures. In addition to `SYSADM` permissions, the user requires `EXECUTE` privileges on additional tables.

To monitor Db2 instances with DPA 2023.2.100 and later versions, modify the monitoring user's permission on each Db2 instance.

The required permissions can be granted in Db2 10.5 and later. DPA 2023.2.100 does not support monitoring earlier versions of Db2.

1. Run the following commands to grant the DPA monitoring user `EXECUTE` privileges on the required tables:

   * If you are upgrading from **DPA 2023.1 or earlier**, run the following commands to grant all required `EXECUTE` privileges:

     ```
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_DATABASE to userName;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_SAMPLE_WORKLOAD_METRICS to userName;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_ACTIVITY to <USER_NAME>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_BUFFERPOOL to <USER_NAME>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_TABLESPACE to <USER_NAME>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_TRANSACTION_LOG to <USER_NAME>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_APPL_LOCKWAIT to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_LOCKS to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_FORMAT_LOCK_NAME to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_UNIT_OF_WORK to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_AGENT to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_PKG_CACHE_STMT to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_CONNECTION to <USER>;
     ```
   * If you are upgrading from **DPA 2023.2.1** and you already granted the additional privileges required by that version, run the following commands to grant the additional `EXECUTE` privileges required by DPA 2023.2.100:

     ```
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_UNIT_OF_WORK to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_AGENT to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_PKG_CACHE_STMT to <USER>;
     grant execute on function SYSPROC.MON_GET_CONNECTION to <USER>;
     ```
2. To verify that the permissions were applied correctly, run the following command:

   ```
   select substr(authid,1,20) as authid
       , authidtype
       , privilege
       , grantable
       , substr(objectschema,1,12) as objectschema
       , substr(objectname,1,30) as objectname
       , objecttype
   from sysibmadm.privileges
   where objectschema ='SYSPROC' AND AUTHID='<USER_NAME>';
   ```

## Known issues

### DPA does not always use the Microsoft JDBC driver by default

When you register a database instance for monitoring, DPA should use the Microsoft JDBC driver by default. However, it uses the jTDS JDBC driver by default if the `system.properties` file does **not** contain the following entry:

`com.confio.ignite.jdbc.sqlserver.useJtdsDriver=false`

This missing configuration is likely to happen on DPA servers where older versions of DPA were initially installed, before DPA began using the Microsoft Driver.

**Resolution or Workaround**:
Open the `system.properties` file in a text editor, and determine if it contains the entry above. If not, manually add it and save the file.

### PostgreSQL OS CPU utilization not showing data on a Windows installation

When PostgreSQL is installed on a server with a Windows operating system, the O/S CPU Utilization resource metric in DPA does not display any data. It displays the message `Chart doesn't have data collected for selected time period`.

If PostgreSQL OS CPU utilization data is missing in other environments, make sure the system\_stats extension is installed. For instructions, see [Register a PostgreSQL database instance and prepare for monitoring](../dpa-register-postgresql-instance.htm#metrics).

**Resolution or Workaround**:
None.

### REST API does not work when you access DPA with SAML login credentials

If you access DPA with SAML login credentials and you generate a refresh token, the following message is displayed when you attempt to use that refresh token to access the REST API:

`You are not authorized to perform this action. Contact your DPA administrator.`

**Resolution or Workaround**:
Access DPA with a local login when you generate the refresh token.

### Importing an alert definition without the associated database assignment rule

In some situations, the log file shows the status of an imported alert definition as both Imported and Failed. This occurs when the alert definition uses a database assignment rule, but the rule was not imported and did not already exist on the server.

The two statuses indicate that the alert definition was imported but the attempt to associate the database assignment rule failed.

**Resolution or Workaround**:
When you import an alert definition that uses a database assignment rule, either import the rule or ensure that it already exists on the server.

If you imported an alert definition and the associated rule is missing, you must [edit the alert definition](../dpa-edit-alert.htm) to specify the database instances. (You can specify instances by manually selecting them or by applying a rule.)
