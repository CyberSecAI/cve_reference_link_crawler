- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A key management error where the RSA SSH host key is lost during shutdown.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-320: Key Management Errors)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker may perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, possibly during the shutdown process of affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be positioned on the network to intercept communication during a vulnerable period. The attacker must be able to intercept the SSH handshake to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
