It is very convenient, as long as the mobile phone is on the body, the number of walking steps will be automatically recorded, and the exercise intensity will be intelligently calculated based on data such as moving distance and steps per minute.

I really like the app. I like to challenge myself & check my steps, miles, floors climbed, etc., every day. I'm not very savvy on all the other stuff, but these little things satisfy me. I like to see how I slept & check my heart rate when I'm active.
