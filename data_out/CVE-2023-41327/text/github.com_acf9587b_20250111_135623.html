## Description

### Impact

WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. [Documentation](https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses).

Until WireMock Webhooks Extension [3.0.0-beta-15](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta-15), the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings.

Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers.

### Affected components

* WireMock Webhooks Extension 2.x versions until 2.35.1 (security patch)
* WireMock 3.x version until 3.0.3 (security patch)
* All versions of WireMock Studio (discontinued). This distribution bundles the WireMock Webhooks Extension and activates it by default

### Patches and Mitigation

* For WireMock 2.x and 3.x - upgrade to the versions with the security patches
* Setup network restrictions similarly to <https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses>
* For WireMock Studio: Stop using discontinued WireMock Studio, migrate to other distributions. The vendor of WireMock Studio recommends migration to [WireMock Cloud](https://www.wiremock.io/product)

NOTE: It was confirmed that [WireMock Cloud](https://www.wiremock.io/product) does not expose sensitive internal APIs and hence not vulnerable to the issue. No action is needed if you use this SaaS distribution.

### Workarounds

* Use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
