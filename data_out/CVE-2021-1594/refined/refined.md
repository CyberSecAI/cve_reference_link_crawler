  "CVE-2021-1594": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for specific API endpoints. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and modifying specific internode communications from one ISE persona to another ISE persona. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to decrypt HTTPS traffic between two ISE personas that are located on separate nodes.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation for specific API endpoints in the REST API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command injection vulnerability",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected Cisco ISE devices.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack",
        "Intercepting and modifying internode communications"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position between two ISE personas located on separate nodes and be capable of decrypting HTTPS traffic between them.",
    "Affected products": "Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco ISE in a distributed deployment.",
     "Fixed software": "Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. The following are the first fixed releases: 2.6 Patch 11, 2.7 Patch 5, 3.0 Patch 4."
