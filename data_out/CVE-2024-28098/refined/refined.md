Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28098:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper authorization in Apache Pulsar's topic-level policy management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Authenticated users with only produce or consume permissions are able to modify topic-level policies.
-  Topic-level policies such as retention, TTL (Time-to-Live), and offloading settings can be modified by unauthorized users.
- Management operations (modifying topic-level policies) should be restricted to users with tenant admin or super user roles.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Unauthorized users can alter critical topic-level configurations, potentially leading to data loss (by modifying retention), unexpected behavior (by changing TTL), or resource issues (by changing offloading settings).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Apache Pulsar's API or management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with produce or consume permissions on a given topic.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Pulsar 2.7.1 before 2.10.6
- Apache Pulsar 2.11.0 before 2.11.4
- Apache Pulsar 3.0.0 before 3.0.3
- Apache Pulsar 3.1.0 before 3.1.3
- Apache Pulsar 3.2.0 before 3.2.1
