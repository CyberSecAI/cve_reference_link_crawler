Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27199:

**CVE-2022-27199**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows unauthorized access to AWS services.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check in a form validation method, which should restrict access based on user roles.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an AWS service using an attacker-specified token. This could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on AWS resources.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can use the vulnerable form validation method to interact with AWS services with a provided, attacker-controlled token.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance. No direct access to the Jenkins controller file system is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is paired with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2022-27198), as the affected form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugin version 191.vcb\_f183ce58b\_9, which adds a permission check and requires POST requests for the form validation method.
