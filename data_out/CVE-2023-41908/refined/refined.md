The provided content contains information related to a security fix in the cerebrate project. The commit `9be81055651649658243b5aa274b175064bfc6db` addresses the issue of missing secure cookie flags for session and CSRF protection.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The session and CSRF protection cookies were not configured with the `secure` flag, making them vulnerable to interception over insecure (HTTP) connections.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of secure cookie flags which can allow session hijacking and CSRF token leakage.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially intercept session and CSRF tokens over HTTP, leading to session hijacking, CSRF attacks, and unauthorized access or manipulation.

- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on insecure network connections (HTTP).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the application.
    - User must be accessing the application over HTTP.

The fix involves:

- In `config/bootstrap.php`, the session configuration is updated to include `session.cookie_secure` set to true. This ensures that the session cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections.
- In `config/routes.php`, the CSRF protection middleware is updated to include the `secure` option set to true, ensuring that the CSRF cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
