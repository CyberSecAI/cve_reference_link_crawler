The provided content relates to CVE-2022-35741.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of XML-based SAML 2.0 messages during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack. These messages are parsed by standard libraries that are susceptible to XML external entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an XXE injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to:
*   Arbitrary file reading
*   Possible denial of service (DoS)
*   Server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the SAML 2.0 authentication service provider plugin when it is enabled. The attacker would need the SAML 2.0 plugin to be enabled on the target system. The attacker sends crafted XML messages during the SAML authentication flow to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SAML 2.0 messages to the vulnerable CloudStack management server, and the SAML 2.0 plugin must be enabled.
