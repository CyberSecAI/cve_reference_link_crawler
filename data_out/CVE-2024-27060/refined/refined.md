Based on the provided information, this content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a NULL pointer dereference in the `tb_port_update_credits()` function within the Thunderbolt driver. This occurs when the driver attempts to access credits of a dual-link port (lane 1) without verifying if the port actually exists. Some Thunderbolt 1 devices might only have a single lane adapter, causing `port->dual_link_port` to be NULL, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to dereference a pointer (`port->dual_link_port`) without checking if it is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The system crashes due to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Plugging in a Thunderbolt 1 device with a single-lane adapter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access: An attacker needs physical access to the system to plug in the vulnerable Thunderbolt device.
