### Description

The WP Datepicker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpdp\_add\_new\_datepicker\_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options that can be used for privilege escalation. This was partially patched in 2.0.9 and 2.1.0, and fully patched in 2.1.1.
