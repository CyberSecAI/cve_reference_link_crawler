{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of SAML IdP metadata, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SAML SSO configuration of a targeted team.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SAML IdP metadata confusion leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of accounts."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, by exploiting knowledge of SAML IdP metadata, can:\n  1. Delete all SAML authenticated accounts of the targeted team.\n  2. Authenticate as a user from existing accounts of the attacked team (if SAML is used for authentication).\n  3. Create arbitrary accounts within the context of the targeted team (unless managed by SCIM).",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack, where an attacker needs to have knowledge of certain details of the SAML IdP metadata of a target team and also be able to configure SAML SSO for their own team on the same backend.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have knowledge of specific details of a target team's SAML IdP metadata and must be able to configure SAML SSO for their own team on the same backend."
