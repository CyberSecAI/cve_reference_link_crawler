| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2213279#c0)  Anten Skrabec    2023-06-07 17:46:51 UTC  ``` The service monitor MAC is exposed through the following flow: ovn_lflow_add(lflows, od, S_SWITCH_IN_L2_LKUP, 110,               "eth.dst == $svc_monitor_mac",               "handle_svc_check(inport);");  This doesn't handle rate limit via CoPP. There is potential to DoS ovn-controller even on deployments with CoPP enabled and configured as all packets with this destination mac within the switch are sent directly to pinctrl thread in ovn-controller.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2213279#c1)  Anten Skrabec    2023-06-07 18:04:22 UTC  ``` Created ovn tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2213285](show_bug.cgi?id=2213285 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - ovn: service monitor MAC flow is not rate limited [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2213279#c5)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-06-13 20:50:37 UTC  ``` Is there any further public information on this issue?

Can you update more information on this issue ?  IMO, if there isn't much information at this time, we can proceed to report it to OVN community and check whether it could be possible threat.
