Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-3153.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The service monitor MAC address in OVN was not rate-limited, which could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of rate limiting on traffic sent to the svc_monitor_mac. This MAC address is used for load balancer health checks and, without rate limiting, an attacker could send a high volume of traffic to it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by overwhelming the ovn-controller. This could prevent Open vSwitch from handling legitimate traffic and cause high CPU usage.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could send traffic to the svc_monitor_mac to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to learn the svc_monitor_mac which can be achieved by:
   a) Accessing the northbound database to view the `options:svc_monitor_mac` value in the NB_Global table.
   b) Sniffing traffic on virtual machines attached to the br-int bridge (if load balancer health checks are configured).
