From: Ales Musil <[amusil at redhat.com](https://mail.openvswitch.org/mailman/listinfo/ovs-dev)>

The SVC monitor was exposed without any limitation.
Add CoPP for the SVC monitor flow, which adds a way
for CMSs to limit the traffic that this flow accepts.

### **[Duraisankarp](/Duraisankarp)** commented [Jul 3, 2023](#issue-1786505202) • edited Loading

| Issue: The service monitor MAC is exposed through the following flow: ovn\_lflow\_add(lflows, od, S\_SWITCH\_IN\_L2\_LKUP, 110, "eth.dst == $svc\_monitor\_mac", "handle\_svc\_check(inport);");  This doesn't handle rate limit via CoPP. There is potential to DoS ovn-controller even on deployments with CoPP enabled and configured as all packets with this destination mac within the switch are sent directly to pinctrl thread in ovn-controller. Reference : <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2213279> Fix required : **Unknown**  Can we have a look at this issue to find out if there could be a possible DoS attack ? |

```
The SVC monitor was exposed without any limitation.
Add CoPP for the SVC monitor flow, which adds a way
for CMSs to limit the traffic that this flow accepts.

Description
===========

Multiple versions of Open Virtual Network (OVN) are vulnerable to a
potential denial of service via traffic sent to the svc_monitor_mac.

The svc_monitor_mac is a MAC address used by OVN for the purposes of
load balancer health checks. The svc_monitor_mac may be explicitly
configured in the northbound database's NB_Global
"options:svc_monitor_mac". If it is not configured, then ovn-northd will
choose a random MAC address for svc_monitor_mac and save it in the
NB_Global "options:svc_monitor_mac". OVN will assign a svc_monitor_mac
regardless of whether any load balancer health checks are configured.

If an attacker were to learn the svc_monitor_mac, then they could
potentially cause a denial of service by continually sending traffic to
the svc_monitor_mac, resulting in continuous upcalls to ovn-controller.
These continuous upcalls can drive up the CPU usage of ovn-controller
and prevent Open vSwitch from being able to handle legitimate traffic.

Note that learning the svc_monitor_mac is not straightforward. The
attacker would need to either
a) Have access to the contents of the northbound database so that they
can see NB_Global's options:svc_monitor_mac value.
b) If load balancer health checks are configured, then the attacker
would need access to virtual machines attached to the br-int bridge so
that traffic could be sniffed to learn the svc_monitor_mac.

Load balancer health checks were added to OVN in October 2019.
Therefore, all OVN releases from 20.03 to 23.06 are vulnerable.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the identifier CVE-2023-3153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

Administrators can mitigate the risk by ensuring that access to the
northbound database and to virtual machines attached to br-int is
restricted. Administrators may further mitigate the risk by periodically
clearing the NB_Global options:svc_monitor_mac in the northbound
database, causing ovn-northd to generate a new random svc_monitor_mac.

Fix
===

Administrators may either apply one of the patches attached to this
advisory, or they may upgrade their OVN version to a patched version.
Administrators should also enable control plane protection (CoPP) for
the new "svc_monitor" meter on logical switches. This goes especially
for logical switches that accept traffic from the public internet. The
OVN project only prepares patches for versions of OVN that are currently
under support. The following versions of OVN have the vulnerability patched:

* OVN version 22.03.3 or higher
* OVN version 22.09.2 or higher
* OVN version 22.12.1 or higher
* OVN version 23.03.1 or higher
* OVN version 23.06.1 or higher

Recommendation
==============

OVN administrators should upgrade to any of the versions listed in the
previous section. Administrators should also enable control plane
protection (CoPP) for the new "svc_monitor" meter on logical switches.
This goes especially for logical switches that accept traffic from the
public internet

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to Ales Musil of Red Hat for discovering, disclosing, and fixing
the vulnerability. Thanks to Dumitru Ceara of Red Hat for confirming the
issue, determining the extent of the issue, and reviewing Ales's patch.

Patch
=====

The attached patches, all written by Ales Musil, provide a fix for each
supported version of OVN.
