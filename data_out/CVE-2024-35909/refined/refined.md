    {
      "source": "git.kernel.org_b522aba4_20250111_083730.html",
      "rootCause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that some registers within the t7xx driver are aligned on a 32-bit boundary. This leads to alignment faults on 64-bit platforms when the driver attempts to access these registers using 64-bit memory access instructions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect memory alignment for register access on 64-bit platforms."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to an alignment fault. This crash can lead to a denial-of-service.",
       "attackVectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by normal operations of the t7xx driver on a 64-bit system."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required, as this can be triggered by the normal driver operation. It is an issue with the driver code itself.",
      "additionalDetails": "The fix involves splitting 64-bit accesses to registers into pairs of non-atomic 32-bit accesses using the io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h helper functions"
