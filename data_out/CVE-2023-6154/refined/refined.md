- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A configuration setting issue in `seccenter.exe`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper configuration settings allow an attacker to modify the product's behavior and potentially load a third-party library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could potentially load third-party libraries, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, allowing for a full compromise of the system, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attack, requiring the attacker to have local access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and low privileges.
