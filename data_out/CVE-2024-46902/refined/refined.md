Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries within the Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector's web service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks due to the insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system.
- The attacker can gain information in the context of the service account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is present in the web service, which listens on TCP port 443 by default, making it exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be authenticated with high-privileged access (admin user rights) to exploit this vulnerability.
