- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in some IntelÂ® oneAPI Toolkit and component software installers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software installers do not properly control the search path, allowing for potential manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could achieve an escalation of privilege by exploiting the uncontrolled search path.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user, and user interaction is required.
