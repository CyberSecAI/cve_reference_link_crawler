Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-10461:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `Content-Disposition` headers in `multipart/x-mixed-replace` responses. Specifically, the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header, which should force a download of the content, was being ignored.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the failure to enforce the `Content-Disposition: attachment` directive in `multipart/x-mixed-replace` responses. This allows the browser to render the content instead of downloading it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` response, which would then be executed by the victim's browser. This could potentially lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious server sending a `multipart/x-mixed-replace` response with a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header that is ignored by the browser. The response body would contain the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control the server sending the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` response. This might involve compromising a legitimate server or setting up a malicious one. The attacker does not necessarily require any other special privileges or access, just the ability to send a crafted HTTP response.
