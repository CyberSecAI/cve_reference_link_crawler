The web interface of the PAC Device allows the device administrator user profile to store malicious scripts in some fields. The stored malicious script is then executed when the GUI is opened by any users of the webserver administration interface. 



The root cause of the vulnerability is inadequate input validation and output encoding in the web administration interface component of the firmware.

This could lead to  unauthorized access and data leakage
