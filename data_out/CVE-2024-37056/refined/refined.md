{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Deserialization of untrusted data through the `cloudpickle.load` function when loading LightGBM scikit-learn models.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)",
    "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-94)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject a malicious pickle object into a LightGBM scikit-learn model during training. This model is then serialized and logged to the tracking server. When a victim loads the model, the malicious pickle object is deserialized, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious LightGBM scikit-learn model with a specially crafted pickle object and log it to a location accessible by the victim. The victim then needs to load this model."
