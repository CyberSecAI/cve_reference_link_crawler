```
{
  "CVE-2024-4418": {
    "Root cause": "A race condition in libvirt's virNetClientIOEventLoop() method where a stack-allocated `virNetClientIOEventData` structure's pointer is used in the `virNetClientIOEventFD` callback after the stack frame has been freed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user could potentially access `virtproxyd` without authenticating. Remote users would still need to authenticate. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, could allow a user to escape their otherwise limited access.",
    "Attack vectors": "The `virtproxyd` daemon can be used to trigger requests which could potentially exercise the bug.  Specifically, a user can make requests that exercise the affected code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local unprivileged user access or authenticated remote user. For local users, no authentication is required."
