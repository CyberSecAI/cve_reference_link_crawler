| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-05-02 12:29:32 UTC  ``` A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free bug was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop().  Quoting libvirt maintainer Daniel P. Berrangé: The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests which could potentially exercise the bug. If libvirt is configured with fine grained access control, this could in theory let a user escape their otherwise limited access. A local unprivileged user can access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could exercise it.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-05-02 12:31:33 UTC  ``` Red Hat would like to thank Martin Širokov for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-05-02 12:33:37 UTC  ``` Created libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2278618](show_bug.cgi?id=2278618 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-4418 libvirt: stack use-after-free in virNetClientIOEventLoop() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-05-06 09:35:54 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/8074d64dc2eca846d6a61efe1a9b7428a0ce1dd1>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-08 02:45:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:4351 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4351](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4351)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-09 12:52:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:4432 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4432](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4432)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2278616#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-23 16:22:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:4757 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4757](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4757)   ``` |  |
