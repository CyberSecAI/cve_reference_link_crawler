Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36668:

**CVE-2021-36668: URL Injection in inSync Client**

*   **Root Cause:** The inSync Electron UI has a vulnerability where it is susceptible to URL injection via the port parameter. This vulnerability arises because the application interprets a port number beginning with "@" sign as username/password in a URL, resulting in unintended consequences.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **URL Injection:** The application improperly handles the port parameter in URLs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.
    *   **NodeJS Code Execution:** By controlling the URL, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary NodeJS code within the Electron UI context.
    *   The Electron app was running an out of date version, without Context Isolation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary NodeJS code.
    *   This can lead to further compromise, potentially including data theft, privilege escalation (if the NodeJS code allows), or other malicious actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, as this vulnerability impacts the Electron UI, which is typically accessed by a logged-in user.
    *   **Manipulation of Port Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the port parameter in a URL to inject arbitrary content.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target system.
    *   **Ability to Modify inSync configuration:** Attacker must be able to manipulate the port number parameter, which is part of the inSync application URL.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities in Druva inSync (from linked research):**

The research details four CVEs:

*   **CVE-2021-36665:** Insecure deserialization in `inSyncUpgradeDaemon` allowing arbitrary code execution as root. An attacker can supply a malicious upgrade package.
*   **CVE-2021-36666:** Code injection via arbitrary dynamic library loading. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable to load a malicious dylib which can then be used to read the secrets from the keychain.
*   **CVE-2021-36667:** OS command injection in the local HTTP server due to an unsanitized call to `os.system`, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as the user running the service.
*   **CVE-2021-36668:** The URL injection vulnerability described above, which allows arbitrary NodeJS code execution in the Electron UI.
