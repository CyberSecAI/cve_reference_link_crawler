- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element within API requests is always an object. When a string is provided instead, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and subsequent device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. The code lacks proper checks to ensure the `param` element is a JSON object before attempting to access its members using the subscription operator. This leads to an assertion failure when a non-object type (like a string) is passed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes, and the device reboots, disrupting its normal operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint with a JSON body where the `param` field is a string instead of an object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device. While many of the vulnerable APIs require an authenticated session, the report notes that the TALOS-2021-1420 vulnerability can be used to bypass authentication, meaning an attacker does not need to authenticate if that vulnerability is also present.

Specifically for CVE-2021-44364:

- The vulnerability exists in the `SetWifi` API where the `param` is expected to be a JSON object but is provided as a string, triggering the assertion.
