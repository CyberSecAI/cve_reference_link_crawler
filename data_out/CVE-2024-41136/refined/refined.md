- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection in the HPE Aruba Networking EdgeConnect SD-WAN gateway's Command Line Interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, authenticated access to the command-line interface of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the command-line interface. They also need user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
