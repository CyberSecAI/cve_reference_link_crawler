Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `exportRegistrations` function of the Mollie Forms plugin. This function is responsible for exporting payment data collected by the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of proper authorization checks before allowing access to the `exportRegistrations` function. Specifically, the function does not verify if the current user has the necessary permissions to export data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker with low-level privileges (subscriber access or higher) can exploit this vulnerability to export sensitive payment data collected by the plugin, potentially exposing customer information and transaction details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Function:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerable `exportRegistrations` function through an HTTP request, bypassing the intended access controls.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user of the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability, but requires minimal permissions (subscriber role or higher).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account on the WordPress site.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** The attacker needs a role with at least "subscriber" level access.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL structure to trigger the vulnerable functionality
