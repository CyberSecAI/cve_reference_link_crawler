Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Fastly plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Specifically, the plugin lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically identified as a "Subscriber") can perform actions that should require higher privileges. This can lead to various impacts depending on the specific function exposed, potentially allowing for data modification, service disruption, or other unauthorized actions. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the plugin, which does not properly check user permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user with the "Subscriber" role within the WordPress instance. They do not require any special admin privileges.
