High

GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3
Jul 4, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 2.6.0

## Patched versions

4.2.10, 4.1.18

## Description

### Summary

By crafting specific activities, an attacker can extend the audience of a post they do not own to other Mastodon users on a target server, thus gaining access to the contents of a post not intended for them.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to read any followers-only or private mention message as long as all the following requirements are met:

* they know the protocol identifier for the target message
* they control an account on a Mastodon server that has legitimate access to the target message

### Severity

High

8.2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
