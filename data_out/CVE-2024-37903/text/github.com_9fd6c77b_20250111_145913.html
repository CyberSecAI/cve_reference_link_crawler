# Mastodon

Warning

**This release is an important security release fixing a major security issue.**

A corresponding security release is available for the [4.2.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.10).

## Changelog

### Security

* Fix incorrect permission checking on multiple API endpoints ([GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7))
* Fix incorrect authorship checking when processing some activities (CVE-2024-37903, [GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3))
* Fix ongoing streaming sessions not being invalidated when application tokens get revoked ([GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx))
* Update dependencies

### Changed

* Change preview cards generation to skip unusually long URLs ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30854))
* Change search modifiers to be case-insensitive ([Gargron](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30865))
* Change `STATSD_ADDR` handling to emit a warning rather than crashing if the address is unreachable ([timothyjrogers](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30691))
* Change PWA start URL from `/home` to `/` ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/27377))

### Fixed

* Fix scheduled statuses scheduled in less than 5 minutes being immediately published ([danielmbrasil](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30584))
* Fix encoding detection for link cards ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30780))
* Fix `/admin/accounts/:account_id/statuses/:id` for edited posts with media attachments ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30819))

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v4.1.18, use `git fetch && git checkout v4.1.18`.

Note

As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: `docker exec mastodon_db_1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name_of_the_backup.dump`

Important

Mastodon is now performing stricter checks to prevent client IP address spoofing. This means that if one of your reverse proxy is not on Mastodon's local network, you will need to set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IP` accordingly, listing the IP address of every trusted reverse-proxy (including local network ones). See [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#trusted_proxy_ip) for more information.

### Dependencies

Warning

The minimum required Ruby version has been bumped to 3.0 in Mastodon v4.1.14.

External dependencies have not changed compared to v4.1.14, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 14, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 4.1.17.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

1. Restart all Mastodon processes
