# Mastodon

Warning

**This release is an important security release fixing a major security issue.**

A corresponding security release is available for the [4.2.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.10).

## Changelog

### Security

* Fix incorrect permission checking on multiple API endpoints ([GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7))
* Fix incorrect authorship checking when processing some activities (CVE-2024-37903, [GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3))
* Fix ongoing streaming sessions not being invalidated when application tokens get revoked ([GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx))
* Update dependencies

### Changed

* Change preview cards generation to skip unusually long URLs ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30854))
* Change search modifiers to be case-insensitive ([Gargron](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30865))
* Change `STATSD_ADDR` handling to emit a warning rather than crashing if the address is unreachable ([timothyjrogers](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30691))
* Change PWA start URL from `/home` to `/` ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/27377))

### Fixed

* Fix scheduled statuses scheduled in less than 5 minutes being immediately published ([danielmbrasil](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30584))
* Fix encoding detection for link cards ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30780))
* Fix `/admin/accounts/:account_id/statuses/:id` for edited posts with media attachments ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30819))

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v4.1.18, use `git fetch && git checkout v4.1.18`.

Note

As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: `docker exec mastodon_db_1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name_of_the_backup.dump`

Important

Mastodon is now performing stricter checks to prevent client IP address spoofing. This means that if one of your reverse proxy is not on Mastodon's local network, you will need to set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IP` accordingly, listing the IP address of every trusted reverse-proxy (including local network ones). See [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#trusted_proxy_ip) for more information.

### Dependencies

Warning

The minimum required Ruby version has been bumped to 3.0 in Mastodon v4.1.14.

External dependencies have not changed compared to v4.1.14, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 14, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 4.1.17.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

1. Restart all Mastodon processes

# Improper authorship check on audience extension for existing posts

High

[renchap](/renchap)
published
GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3
Jul 4, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 2.6.0

## Patched versions

4.2.10, 4.1.18

## Description

### Summary

By crafting specific activities, an attacker can extend the audience of a post they do not own to other Mastodon users on a target server, thus gaining access to the contents of a post not intended for them.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to read any followers-only or private mention message as long as all the following requirements are met:

* they know the protocol identifier for the target message
* they control an account on a Mastodon server that has legitimate access to the target message

### Severity

High

8.2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

# Mastodon

Warning

**This release is an important security release fixing a major security issue.**

A corresponding security release is available for the [4.1.x branch](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.18).

Note

If you are using nightly builds, **do not use this release** but update to `nightly.2024-07-05-security` or newer instead. If you are on the `main` branch, update to the latest commit.

## Changelog

### Security

* Fix incorrect permission checking on multiple API endpoints ([GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-58x8-3qxw-6hm7))
* Fix incorrect authorship checking when processing some activities (CVE-2024-37903, [GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3))
* Fix ongoing streaming sessions not being invalidated when application tokens get revoked ([GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-vp5r-5pgw-jwqx))
* Update dependencies

### Added

* Add yarn version specification to avoid confusion with Yarn 3 and Yarn 4

### Changed

* Change preview cards generation to skip unusually long URLs ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30854))
* Change search modifiers to be case-insensitive ([Gargron](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30865))
* Change `STATSD_ADDR` handling to emit a warning rather than crashing if the address is unreachable ([timothyjrogers](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30691))
* Change PWA start URL from `/home` to `/` ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/27377))

### Removed

* Removed dependency on `posix-spawn` ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/18559))

### Fixed

* Fix scheduled statuses scheduled in less than 5 minutes being immediately published ([danielmbrasil](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30584))
* Fix encoding detection for link cards ([oneiros](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30780))
* Fix `/admin/accounts/:account_id/statuses/:id` for edited posts with media attachments ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30819))
* Fix duplicate `@context` attribute in user archive export ([ClearlyClaire](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/30653))

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v4.2.10, use `git fetch && git checkout v4.2.10`.

Note

As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: `docker exec mastodon_db_1 pg_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name_of_the_backup.dump`

Important

Mastodon is now performing stricter checks to prevent client IP address spoofing. This means that if one of your reverse proxy is not on Mastodon's local network, you will need to set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IP` accordingly, listing the IP address of every trusted reverse-proxy (including local network ones). See [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#trusted_proxy_ip) for more information.

### Dependencies

With the exception of Ruby's recommended version, external dependencies have not changed since v4.2.0, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 3.0 to 3.2
* PostgreSQL: 10 or newer
* Elasticsearch (recommended, for full-text search): 7.x (OpenSearch should also work)
* LibreTranslate (optional, for translations): 1.3.3 or newer
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: 16 or newer
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

### Update steps

Tip

The `charlock_holmes` gem may fail to build on some systems with recent versions of `gcc`.

If you run into such an issue, try `BUNDLE_BUILD__CHARLOCK_HOLMES="--with-cxxflags=-std=c++17" bundle install`.

The following instructions are for updating from 4.2.9.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
2. Restart all Mastodon processes

**Using Docker:**

1. Restart all Mastodon processes
