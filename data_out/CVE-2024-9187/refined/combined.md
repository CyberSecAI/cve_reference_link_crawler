### Description

The Read more By Adam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the deleteRm() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete read more buttons.
