The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35870.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the `smb2_reconnect_server()` function. This occurs because `smb2_reconnect_server()` attempts to access a session that is being concurrently torn down by another thread executing `__cifs_put_smb_ses()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free (UAF): The primary vulnerability is a UAF, where a session structure is accessed after it has been freed.
- Race Condition: The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the `smb2_reconnect_server()` worker thread and the thread executing `__cifs_put_smb_ses()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System Crash: The UAF leads to a general protection fault, resulting in a system crash.
- Potential for Further Exploitation: Although not detailed, UAF vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Disconnection/Reconnection: The vulnerability is triggered when a client experiences a disconnection from the server. When the client attempts to reconnect, the `smb2_reconnect_server()` worker thread is invoked.
- Threading: The vulnerability exploits a race condition between the `smb2_reconnect_server()` worker thread and another thread that is tearing down the session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a network disconnection with a SMB server.
- No special user privileges seem to be required to trigger this vulnerability, it can be triggered by standard user operations like mounting and unmounting.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs due to the following sequence:
1. A client has a connection to a server.
2. Another thread attempts to terminate a session by calling `__cifs_put_smb_ses()`, which decrements the session count and sets its status to `SES_EXITING`.
3. However, the `smb2_reconnect_server()` worker thread attempts to reconnect which triggers the use of the ipc before the session structure is completely torn down
4. The `smb2_reconnect_server` attempts to access the session's data, but the data is already in the process of being freed by `__cifs_put_smb_ses()`, leading to the UAF.

**Fix:**
The fix involves ensuring that the session status is unconditionally set to `SES_EXITING` and that no other threads can alter the status during the teardown process. Also, the tree disconnect is moved before the status change.
