Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2936

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes, specifically the `_id` attribute of widgets within the Sydney Toolbox plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected via the `_id` attribute of widgets. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed whenever a user accesses a page containing the affected widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Data Theft:** This can lead to various malicious activities like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could also alter the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, as it involves an attacker sending malicious input to the WordPress application.
*   **Widget Attribute Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `_id` attribute of a widget when creating or editing content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Modify Widget Content:**  The attacker needs to be able to create or modify widgets on the website.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Sydney Toolbox plugin up to and including 1.26.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.27 by adding output escaping to the `_id` attribute.
* The fix is implemented by using `esc_attr()` and `esc_url()` functions.
* The vulnerable code is located in `inc/elementor/block-slider.php`, specifically where the `_id` and background image URL are used when creating HTML attributes for the slide element.
