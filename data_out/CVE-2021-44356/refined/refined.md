```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `SetAudioAlarm`'s JSON `param` parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, accessing it using subscription operator, but the code does not validate the type of the JSON element leading to an assertion failure and denial of service.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation: The application does not validate the type of the JSON element before accessing it, leading to an assertion failure."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially-crafted HTTP request that results in a reboot of the device. The `cgiserver.cgi` process will terminate due to the assertion, which will prevent it from sending heartbeats, and eventually cause the device to reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the /cgi-bin/api.cgi endpoint with a JSON payload in the body that contains the `SetAudioAlarm` command, and an empty string as the value of the 'param' key.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While most of these commands require a logged-in user, the report notes that it's possible to use TALOS-2021-1420 to perform these API calls without authentication, this is not explicit to the current CVE but it's mentioned."
