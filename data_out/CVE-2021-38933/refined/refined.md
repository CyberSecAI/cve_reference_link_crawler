- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms in IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not specify the exact attack vector, but it implies that the vulnerability lies in the cryptographic processing of the product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify the exact capabilities/position but implies that the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept/access the encrypted information that is processed by the vulnerable software.
