…lback

The ub_result pointer passed to unbound_resolver_callback by
libunbound can be NULL if the query was for something malformed
like `.1` or `[.1]`.  If it is, we now set a 'ns_r_formerr' result
and return instead of crashing with a SEGV.  This causes pjproject
to simply cancel the transaction with a "No answer record in the DNS
response" error.  The existing "off nominal" unit test was also
updated to check this condition.

Although not necessary for this fix, we also made
ast_dns_resolver_completed() tolerant of a NULL result.

manager.c: Add entries to Originate blacklist

Added Reload and DBdeltree to the list of dialplan application that
can't be executed via the Originate manager action without also
having write SYSTEM permissions.

Added CURL, DB*, FILE, ODBC and REALTIME* to the list of dialplan
functions that can't be executed via the Originate manager action
without also having write SYSTEM permissions.

If the Queue application is attempted to be run by the Originate
manager action and an AGI parameter is specified in the app data,
it'll be rejected unless the manager user has either the AGI or
SYSTEM permissions.

…lback

The ub_result pointer passed to unbound_resolver_callback by
libunbound can be NULL if the query was for something malformed
like `.1` or `[.1]`.  If it is, we now set a 'ns_r_formerr' result
and return instead of crashing with a SEGV.  This causes pjproject
to simply cancel the transaction with a "No answer record in the DNS
response" error.  The existing "off nominal" unit test was also
updated to check this condition.

Although not necessary for this fix, we also made
ast_dns_resolver_completed() tolerant of a NULL result.

manager.c: Add entries to Originate blacklist

```
Added Reload and DBdeltree to the list of dialplan application that
can't be executed via the Originate manager action without also
having write SYSTEM permissions.

Added CURL, DB*, FILE, ODBC and REALTIME* to the list of dialplan
functions that can't be executed via the Originate manager action
without also having write SYSTEM permissions.

If the Queue application is attempted to be run by the Originate
manager action and an AGI parameter is specified in the app data,
it'll be rejected unless the manager user has either the AGI or
SYSTEM permissions.

…lback

The ub_result pointer passed to unbound_resolver_callback by
libunbound can be NULL if the query was for something malformed
like `.1` or `[.1]`.  If it is, we now set a 'ns_r_formerr' result
and return instead of crashing with a SEGV.  This causes pjproject
to simply cancel the transaction with a "No answer record in the DNS
response" error.  The existing "off nominal" unit test was also
updated to check this condition.

Although not necessary for this fix, we also made
ast_dns_resolver_completed() tolerant of a NULL result.

# A malformed Contact or Record-Route URI in an incoming SIP request can cause Asterisk to crash when res\_resolver\_unbound is used

## Package

## Description

### Impact

If Asterisk attempts to send a SIP request to a URI whose host portion starts with `.1` or `[.1]`, and res\_resolver\_unbound is loaded, Asterisk will crash with a SEGV.

The URI can be set a number of ways:

* When Asterisk receives a SIP request from a client with such a malformed Contact or Record-Route URI and the incoming endpoint's `rewrite_contact` parameter is `false`, when Asterisk subsequently sends a request back to the client using that malformed URI it will crash with a SEGV. Setting `rewrite_contact` to `true` prevents the crash by rewriting the URI to contain the sender's IP address and port. NOTE: An unauthenticated client can only trigger the crash if anonymous calling is allowed, which should rarely be the case.
* An authorized dialplan author sets the dialstring of the Dial application to a include a malformed URI instead of an extension. Example: `PJSIP/<endpoint>/sip:.1`
* An AMI or ARI user with Originate permissions sets the Channel parameter to use a malformed URI instead of an extension. Example: `PJSIP.<endpoint>/sip:.1`.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to one of the following versions: 18.24.3, 20.9.3, 21.4.3, certified-18.9-cert12, certified-20.7-cert3.

### Workarounds

Do one or both of the following:

* Disable res\_resolver\_unbound by setting `noload = res_resolver_unbound.so` in modules.conf.
* Set `rewrite_contact = yes` on all PJSIP endpoints. NOTE: This may not be appropriate for all Asterisk configurations.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
