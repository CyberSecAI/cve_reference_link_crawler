- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of symlinks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A malicious app can create symlinks to protected regions of the disk due to insufficient symlink validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application can potentially gain unauthorized access to or modify protected areas of the disk, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation involves a malicious application creating specially crafted symlinks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious application running on the system.
