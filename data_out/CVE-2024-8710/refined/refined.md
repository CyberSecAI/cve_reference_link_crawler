Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `/model/viewProduct.php` file of the Inventory Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including product information, user details, or any other information the database contains.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Beyond just reading data, an attacker could manipulate or delete records in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server itself or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `id` parameter of an HTTP request, typically a GET request, sent to `/model/viewProduct.php`.
- **Burp Suite or similar:** Tools like Burp Suite are used to intercept and modify the HTTP request, allowing injection of malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application, either locally or remotely.
- **Understanding of HTTP:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests to modify parameters.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL queries.
- **Tools:** Using a proxy like Burp Suite and a tool like SQLmap are part of the exploit process.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerable system is the "Inventory-Management System - 1.0", available at the provided link.
- The file identified as vulnerable is `/Inventory-Management/model/viewProduct.php`.
- The provided steps in the Github content show how to use Burp Suite to intercept a request, copy it to file, and use SQLmap to confirm the vulnerability exists.
- VulDB submission #404976 confirms the presence of SQL injection in the "id" parameter of the system.
