- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dynamic Data Mapping module in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not properly restrict access to Document and Media files when they are downloaded via a Form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is caused by insufficient access control in the Dynamic Data Mapping module, allowing unauthorized download of files via crafted URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download any file from Document and Media without proper authorization, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that bypasses access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the Liferay instance, but does not need any prior authentication or privileged access. The attack can be performed remotely with no special user interaction.
