  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not require the user's current password when changing their password. Additionally, the password change request lacks a CSRF token, allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing current password check during password change.",
      "Absence of CSRF token validation for password change requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can change a user's password without knowing their current password and without their consent. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over user accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious link or webpage crafted by the attacker that triggers a password change request when accessed by a logged-in user."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
       "Ability to craft a malicious link or web page that targets the vulnerable password change request endpoint.",
