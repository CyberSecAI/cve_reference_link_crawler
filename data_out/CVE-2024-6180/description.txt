The EventON plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'eventon_import_settings' ajax action in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.15. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings, including adding stored cross-site scripting to settings options displayed on event calendar pages.
