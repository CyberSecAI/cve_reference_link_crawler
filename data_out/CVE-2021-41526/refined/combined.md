# MindManager 23 - full disclosure

Resending! Thank you for your efforts.

GitHub - pawlokk/mindmanager-poc: public disclosure<<https://github.com/pawlokk/mindmanager-poc>>

Affected application: MindManager23_setup.exe

Platform: Windows

Issue: Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer Repair Mode (EXE hijacking race condition)

Discovered and reported by: Pawel Karwowski and Julian Horoszkiewicz (Eviden Red Team)

Proposed mitigation: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/disablemsi>

Reasoning for public disclosure: Sitting on this indefinitely in the long run benefits threat actors (the issue is
trivial to find), while keeping users and administrators in the dark, unaware of the risk.

What is the vendor's position? According to the vendor it is not their responsibility, as the vulnerability lies in a
3rd party component (CVE-2021-41526). This doesn't mean that their software isn't vulnerable, though. We originally
reported this issue to vendor on 22.08.2023. Since then, we could not convince them to release a fix, even despite
involving US CERT into coordination efforts. After prolonged period of exchanging messages back and forth, we agreed
with CERT that in this situation public disclosure is the proper course of action.

What's the vulnerability? On systems with MindManager23 installed, it is possible for regular users to trigger the
installer in "repair" mode, by issuing the following command: msiexec.exe /fa PATH_TO_INSTALLER_FILE.msi

This triggers the msiexec service, which carries the repair process, running multiple actions and, among others,
creates files inside of the C:\Users\pk\AppData\Local\Temp directory, which have their filenames dynamically generated,
in the following pattern: "wac.tmp", for example, wac98DF.tmp. The process then uses the generated wac****.tmp file
(executable) running as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM to write to, and load an image of itself.

Since the C:\Users\pk\AppData\Local\ directory is owned by the regular user, the C:\Users\pk\AppData\Local\Temp\
directory inherits the permissions, making it possible for the regular user to interfere with the contents of the
directory, for example by overwriting the dynamically generated DLL\EXE files.

The privilege escalation in Mind Manager installer is caused by its use of a known vulnerable component - Flexera
Installshield, affected by CVE-2021-41526. Mind Manager should use an up-to-date version of the Flexera Installshield -
or repacakge the MSI so it does not support "repair mode", or requires administrative privileges to run it.

What is the exploitation process? Exploitation is done with the use of a powershell script that runs the .MSI file,
checks for the presence and creation of our legit DLL\EXE of interest, and repeatedly copies the Proof of Concept
DLL\EXE into the Appdata\Local\Temp directory, effectively overwriting the legit DLL\EXE file. After being ran, the PoC
DLL\EXE file creates a poc.txt file in C:\Users\Public, together with the command line that called it, and whoami
output.

Kind regards,

# MNDT-2021-0011

Flexera Revenera InstallShield for Windows prior to version 2021 R2 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability during MSI repair for the MSI built with InstallScript custom action.

## Impact

High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker SYSTEM level privileges.

## Exploitability

Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2021-41526

## Technical Details

During MSI repair, InstallScript custom actions, if configured in the project, will be executed by extracting the InstallScript engine files to a unique folder in the user’s TEMP directory and then executed.

InstallScript engine files contain an executable named ISBEW64.EXE, which will be executed during the InstallScript code execution. As a result, during MSI repair, a low privilege user can invoke the operation and attain privilege escalation to “NT Authority/SYSTEM” by replacing ISBEW64.EXE in the TEMP folder with a malicious one.

## Resolution

The issue was fixed in version 2021 R2. Update to this version to address the vulnerability.
