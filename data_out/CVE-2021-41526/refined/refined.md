Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Flexera Revenera InstallShield for Windows, specifically during MSI repair operations when InstallScript custom actions are involved. The vulnerability stems from the way InstallShield extracts and executes the InstallScript engine files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** During MSI repair, InstallShield extracts the InstallScript engine files, including `ISBEW64.EXE`, to a user's temporary directory (`%TEMP%`).
2.  **Lack of Access Control:** The temporary directory, while being within user's profile, inherits the user's permissions, allowing them to modify files within, including the extracted `ISBEW64.EXE` executable.
3.  **Unsafe Execution:** The `ISBEW64.EXE` file, which is executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, can be replaced by a malicious executable. This enables a local privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a local unprivileged attacker to gain `SYSTEM` level privileges on the vulnerable Windows system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **MSI Repair Trigger:** The attack is triggered by initiating an MSI repair operation, specifically on MSI packages that use InstallScript custom actions. This can be done by running the command: `msiexec.exe /fa PATH_TO_INSTALLER_FILE.msi`
2.  **File Replacement:** The attacker replaces the legitimate `ISBEW64.EXE` file in the temporary directory with a malicious executable before it is executed by the InstallScript engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target Windows system.
2.  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user (does not require administrative privileges).
3.  **Ability to Write to %TEMP%:** The attacker must be able to write to the user's temporary directory.
4.  **Knowledge of vulnerable MSI packages**: The attacker needs to be aware of MSI packages using InstallScript custom actions.

**Additional Details from the provided content**

*   **Vendor's Response:** The vendor of the affected application (MindManager) initially considered it a third-party issue (Flexera InstallShield) and did not release a fix, even after involving US CERT. The vendor was urged to update their Flexera InstallShield version, repackage the MSI to remove repair mode, or require admin privileges for repair.
*   **Exploitation Process (MindManager Case):** A PowerShell script is used to trigger the MSI repair process and overwrite the dynamically generated `wac****.tmp` executable in the temp directory with a malicious executable before it's executed by the installer running with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Patch Information:**  The vulnerability was fixed in Flexera Revenera InstallShield version 2021 R2.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was reported to Flexera Revenera on 18-Nov-2021, confirmed on 24-Nov-2021, and a patch was released on 17-Dec-2021.
