The individual vulnerabilities documented on this VMSA for ESXi have severity Important but combining these issues will result in Critical severity.

##### **3a. Use-after-free vulnerability in XHCI USB controller (CVE-2024-22252)**

**Description**

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a use-after-free vulnerability in the XHCI USB controller. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [9.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) for Workstation/Fusion and in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [8.4](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) for ESXi.

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is contained within the VMX sandbox whereas, on Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.

**[1]** While Broadcom does not mention end-of-life products in the Security Advisories, due to the critical severity of these vulnerabilities Broadcom has made a patch available to customers with extended support for ESXi 6.7 ([6.7U3u](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202403001.html)), 6.5 ([6.5U3v)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/rn/esxi650-202403001.html) and [VCF 3.x](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/96717).

**[2]** Because of the severity of these issues, Broadcom has made additional patches available for ESXi 8.0 U1. If you do not plan to update your environment to ESXi 8.0 Update 2b (build # 23305546), use 8.0 Update 1d to update your ESXi hosts of version 8.0 Update 1c (build # 22088125) and earlier for these security fixes. The supported update path from 8.0 Update 1d is to ESXi 8.0 Update 2b or later. For more information, see the [Product Interoperability Matrix](https://interopmatrix.vmware.com/Upgrade?productId=1&isHidePatch=false&isHideLegacyReleases=true).
