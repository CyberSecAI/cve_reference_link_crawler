Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

## CVE-2022-22576

# OAUTH2 bearer bypass in connection re-use

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27th 2022 - [Permalink](/docs/CVE-2022-22576.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl might reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly
making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same
credentials as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled
protocols: SMTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (OpenLDAP only).

libcurl maintains a pool of live connections after a transfer has
completed (sometimes called the connection cache). This pool of
connections is then gone through when a new transfer is requested and if
there is a live connection available that can be reused, it is preferred
instead of creating a new one.

Due to this security vulnerability, a connection that is successfully
created and authenticated with a username + OAUTH2 bearer could
subsequently be erroneously reused even for user + [other OAUTH2
bearer], even though that might not even be a valid bearer. This could
lead to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious
actor.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-22576 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/19a05c908f7d8b>

Note that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/852aa5ad351ea53e5f>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Set the bearer string as password *as well* when using
OAUTH2 bearer authentication with these protocols.

## TIMELINE

It was first reported to the curl project on March 18 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 18.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. These flaws may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a
denial of service attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.64.0-4+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
