## CVE-2022-22576

# OAUTH2 bearer bypass in connection re-use

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27th 2022 - [Permalink](/docs/CVE-2022-22576.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl might reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly
making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same
credentials as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled
protocols: SMTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (OpenLDAP only).

libcurl maintains a pool of live connections after a transfer has
completed (sometimes called the connection cache). This pool of
connections is then gone through when a new transfer is requested and if
there is a live connection available that can be reused, it is preferred
instead of creating a new one.

Due to this security vulnerability, a connection that is successfully
created and authenticated with a username + OAUTH2 bearer could
subsequently be erroneously reused even for user + [other OAUTH2
bearer], even though that might not even be a valid bearer. This could
lead to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious
actor.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-22576 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) to and including [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.33.0](vuln-7.33.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/19a05c908f7d8b>

Note that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/852aa5ad351ea53e5f>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Set the bearer string as password *as well* when using
OAUTH2 bearer authentication with these protocols.

## TIMELINE

It was first reported to the curl project on March 18 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on April 18.

libcurl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
