## Improvements

### Support for OPTIONS method for CORS preflight requests

In this release, Magnolia brings two new filter implementations that
handle CORS preflight requests:

* `info.magnolia.module.site.filters.SiteAwareCorsFilter`
* `info.magnolia.cors.SelfConfiguredCorsFilter`

When an OPTIONS HTTP request is received, Magnolia responds with headers
that describe delivery capabilities based on the URI of the request and
on active security and site configurations.

Developers can now configure CORS headers to be returned for such
requests via either a site configuration or a configuration on the CORS
filter.

Example configuration for a site called `foo`:

/modules/multisite/config/sites/foo/cors.yaml

```
rest:
  allowedHeaders:
    - '*'
  allowedMethods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - OPTIONS
  allowedOrigins:
    - https://magnolia-cms.com
    - https://example.com
  uris:
    rest:
      patternString: /.rest/*
```

Same configuration on the CORS filter:

![Configuration on the CORS filter](../../_images/6-2-4-corsFilterConfig.png)

[MAGNOLIA-7215](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7215),
[MGNLSITE-101](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLSITE-101)

### Resolver of asset links in rich text fields

When configuring a Magnolia
[v2
delivery endpoint](../../Developing/API/Delivery-API/), you can use a reference resolver for asset links in
rich text fields. The resolver converts UUID-based asset links to links
with an absolute or relative URL. For the resolver properties, see
[Resolving
asset links in rich text fields](../../Developing/API/Delivery-API/Resolving-references-with-the-delivery-endpoint/#_resolving_asset_links_in_rich_text_fields).

Example fragment of a REST response with the word `Kyoto` functioning
as a link to an asset called `kyoto.jpg` and with the UUID
`0a3bb34f-b49f-4e02-a9e9-e46cf860b612`:

```
<p>Experience the still beauty that permeates and surrounds <a href=\"${link:{uuid:{0a3bb34f-b49f-4e02-a9e9-e46cf860b612},repository:{dam},path:{/untitled}}}\">Kyoto</a>.</p>
```

A fragment showing the converted link:

```
<p>Experience the still beauty that permeates and surrounds <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/fallback/dam/jcr:0a3bb34f-b49f-4e02-a9e9-e46cf860b612/kyoto.jpg\">Kyoto</a>.</p>
```

[MGNLREST-196](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLREST-196)

### Asset names numbered on duplication

If you duplicate an asset, a number will be appended to its name (left).
Previously, with no such number, it was difficult to tell the original
and the duplicate apart (right).

![Asset names numbered on duplication example](../../_images/MGNLDAM-817.png)

[MGNLDAM-817](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-817)

### Timeout for locking mechanism

There is now a five-minute timeout for
[the
locking mechanism](../../Administration/Architecture/Publishing/#_locking) to mitigate an issue where nodes are locked even
after publishing. For more details about this issue, see
[EEPUBLISH-28](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/EEPUBLISH-28).

In addition, logging of publishing operations on the
[Receiver](../../Administration/Instances/Receivers/) has been moved from
the TRACE level to the DEBUG level.

[PUBLISHING-90](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PUBLISHING-90)

### Improved observation mechanism

When a new version of a content node is created in one workspace, the
improved Magnolia observation mechanism (`info.magnolia.observation.*`)
makes sure that Magnolia does not react unnecessarily to any event that
creates a node in `/jcr:system`.

[MAGNOLIA-7858](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7858)

### Better user experience in tree view

To improve column filtering in the tree view, the following has been
implemented:

* When at least one column filter is active, the tree view uses a flat
  structure. This is similar to the *Magnolia 5 UI* search view, but now
  the views are not switched.
* When all column filters are empty, the tree view reverts to the
  default structure.

[MGNLUI-6225](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6225)

### New API to configure default values in form fields

Default values must be applied to form fields explicitly. To facilitate
this, the `EditorView#applyDefaults()` API has been introduced.

A
[select
field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Select-field/) that uses an option list can now specify an option (string) as a
default value, while a JCR select field can specify a UUID or path.

[MGNLUI-5852](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-5852)

### Deprecated upload field

As of this release, both
[UploadFieldDefinition](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.public.releases/archive/info/magnolia/ui/magnolia-ui-framework/6.2.4/magnolia-ui-framework-6.2.4-javadoc.jar/%21/info/magnolia/ui/field/UploadFieldDefinition.html) and
[UploadViewDefinition](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.public.releases/archive/info/magnolia/ui/magnolia-ui-framework/6.2.4/magnolia-ui-framework-6.2.4-javadoc.jar/%21/info/magnolia/ui/editor/UploadViewDefinition.html) are
deprecated. In addition,
[DamUploadFieldDefinition](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.public.releases/archive/info/magnolia/dam/magnolia-dam-app/3.0.4/magnolia-dam-app-3.0.4-javadoc.jar/%21/info/magnolia/dam/app/field/DamUploadFieldDefinition.html)
is no longer annotated as a field type.

|  | Do not use `UploadFieldDefinition` to upload assets directly to an app workspace. It is best to store your assets in the [DAM](../../Features/Digital-asset-management/) workspace and link to them using a [link field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/).   `DamUploadFieldDefinition` makes only sense in the context of the [Magnolia Assets subapp](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Assets-app/Magnolia-Assets-subapp/). Do not use it generically in any other context. |
| --- | --- |

[MGNLUI-5886](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-5886)

### New password field for *Magnolia 6 UI*

`PasswordFieldDefinition` renders a
[text
field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Text-field/) that masks input values when used only with custom actions. Note
that passwords can be revealed in plain text when the field is used in
dialogs with a standard `commit` action.

For more information, see
[Password
field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Password-field/).

[MGNLUI-5537](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-5537)

### `jcrChildNodeProvider` used by default with JCR multi field

`jcrChildNodeProvider` is now the
[item
provider](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/Item-providers/) used by default in
[info.magnolia.ui.field.JcrMultiFieldDefinition](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.public.releases/archive/info/magnolia/ui/magnolia-ui-framework-jcr/6.2.4/magnolia-ui-framework-jcr-6.2.4-javadoc.jar/%21/info/magnolia/ui/field/JcrMultiFieldDefinition.html).

[MGNLUI-6221](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6221)

### New availability rule to check depth of JCR item

The `jcrDepthRule` action availability type returns `true` if the item
is within the specified depth range.

[MGNLUI-6192](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6192)

### Clear node name behavior in content type apps

To avoid any confusion between the `name` and `jcrName` properties:

* Apps generated from content types use `name` instead of `jcrName`.
* The JCR Browser app shows only real node names regardless of whether `jcrName` is configured.

[MGNLUI-6334](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6334)

### Support for Java 7 locale IDs

From this release, you can use
[Java
8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html) or [Java
7](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase7locales.html) locale IDs in configuration. To refer to the Dutch spoken in Belgium,
for example, you may use either `nl-BE` or `nl_BE`.

[MAGNOLIA-7897](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7897)

## Library updates

This release comes with third-party library updates to fix some security
and compatibility issues as well as improve performance. The following
are the most notable updates:

* HttpClient updated to 4.5.13
  ([BUILD-411](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-411)).
* RESTEasy and Jackson updated to 4.5.8.Final and 2.11.1 respectively
  ([BUILD-403](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-403)).
* SmallRye updated to 1.6.2
  ([BUILD-409](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-409)).
* Tomcat updated to 9.0.39
  ([MGNLTOMCAT-17](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLTOMCAT-17)).

We keep the details of security-related fixes private in line with our
[security policy](../../Administration/Security/Security-policy/).
[Contact our Support team](../../Support/) if you need more information.

## Notable bug fixes

The following issues have been resolved where:

* In the Byte Buddy library, `ByteBuddyMutableWrapperHelper` did not
  properly cache the generated proxy classes
  ([MAGNOLIA-7893](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7893)).
* In the
  [Content
  Translation Support module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Translation-Support-module/), exporting translation files failed when
  dialogs were defined using *Magnolia 6 UI*
  ([MGNLCTS-116](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLCTS-116)).
* In the
  [link
  field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/) ([MGNLUI-6126](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6126)):

  + The chooser dialog failed to open after reconfiguring a field with
    existing content.
  + An empty field was rendered after deleting the stored reference.

To solve performance issues when exporting large files, the
`prettyPrint` property in
[JcrExportCommand](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.public.releases/archive/info/magnolia/magnolia-core/6.2.4/magnolia-core-6.2.4-javadoc.jar/%21/info/magnolia/importexport/command/JcrExportCommand.html) is
now disabled by default in Java 11+
([MAGNOLIA-7890](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7890)).

As part of a security fix, `HtmlColumnRenderer` now supports only the
`class`, `title`, `style` and `target` attributes
([MGNLUI-6380](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6380),
restricted access).

## Security advisory

We have fixed several security issues (including vulnerabilities to
deserialization, SSRF and XSS attacks) with this release. We keep the
details of those fixes private in line with our
[security policy](../../Administration/Security/Security-policy/).
[Contact our Support team](../../Support/) if you need more information.

## Others

### WebSphere, WildFly/EAP and WebLogic application servers in maintenance mode

As of this release, the compatibility modules for the following
application servers are in maintenance mode:

* IBM WebSphere and WebSphere Liberty
* JBoss WildFly and EAP
* Oracle WebLogic

We provide support for these servers, but we do not proactively test
them for future releases. In line with this change, we no longer provide
the associated webapps:

* `magnolia-dx-core-websphere-webapp`
* `magnolia-dx-core-wildfly-webapp`
* `magnolia-dx-core-weblogic-webapp`

All information about deploying Magnolia to these servers has been moved
to the [Deploying Magnolia as WAR file](https://wiki.magnolia-cms.com/display/WIKI/Deploying%2BMagnolia%2Bas%2BWAR%2Bfile) page of our Community Wiki.
