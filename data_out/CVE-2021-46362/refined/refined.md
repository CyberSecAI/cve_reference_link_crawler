Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46362:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of FreeMarker template engine in the registration and forgotten password forms, which allows for dynamic content generation in emails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The "fullname" parameter is vulnerable to SSTI, allowing an attacker to inject malicious FreeMarker code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Filtering:** While there is some filtering of double and single quotes, it is not sufficient to prevent exploitation. Attackers can bypass restrictions by using other parameters, such as "username," to construct the full payload.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the SSTI vulnerability can lead to RCE, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker injects malicious code through the registration or forgotten password forms, specifically targeting the "fullname" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted requests to the vulnerable forms (registration or forgotten password) on the Magnolia CMS instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a file on a server they control that the vulnerable application can download.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves splitting a FreeMarker payload across the "username" and "fullname" parameters. The "username" parameter is used to store the malicious code, while the "fullname" parameter uses a FreeMarker substring function to concatenate the payload and execute it.
*   The exploit uses two steps to obtain RCE due to character restrictions in the username:
    1.  The first step is to download an exploit file containing a reverse shell command using `wget`.
    2.  The second step is to execute the downloaded exploit using `bash`.
* The specific vulnerable versions are Magnolia CMS <= 6.2.3.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor provided a fix for this vulnerability in version 6.2.4.
* The vendor's advisory is linked in the provided text.
