Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a weakness in Argo CD's brute-force protection mechanism. This mechanism uses a cache to track login attempts, which has a limited size. By overflowing this cache with login attempts for numerous different usernames, an attacker can evict the failed login attempts of the target user (e.g. the admin account), effectively bypassing the rate limiting and brute-force protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Cache Size:** The cache used to store failed login attempts is limited to 1000 entries, which can be easily overflowed.
*   **Vulnerable Cache Eviction Logic:** The eviction logic randomly removes a cached entry. This is problematic as it doesn't prioritize retaining login failures of the user targeted in a brute-force attack. The admin user could be evicted from cache allowing the attacker to attempt more logins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Brute-Force Protection:** An attacker can bypass rate limiting and brute force protections, allowing them to attempt a much larger amount of login attempts, which is previously patched in CVE-2020-8827.
*   **Accelerated Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can perform brute-force attacks at an accelerated rate, targeting the default admin account.
*   **Compromise of Admin Account:** This significantly increases the likelihood of gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
*   **Login Page:** The vulnerability is exploited by interacting with the application's login page.
*   **Cache Overflow:** The core of the attack involves overflowing the cache by sending numerous login requests with different usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Argo CD instance.
*   **Knowledge of Login Page:** The attacker needs to know the location of the login page.
*   **Ability to Send Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability since the attack occurs prior to authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability allows for a much higher login attempt rate (230 attempts in 15 minutes) compared to the intended behavior, effectively making the previously patched rate limits useless.
*   The fix involves increasing the default cache size and implement a more secure cache eviction strategy, excluding the admin and the currently attempting user from being removed from cache.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 5.4 (Moderate), with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N. The changed scope is because the vulnerability impacts the overall security of the application rather than just the targeted component.
