- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded password within the `infactory` command of the InRouter302 console. This password is used to access privileged functionalities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hard-coded password. The system decrypts a hardcoded, hex-encoded string using a hardcoded AES key, and then compares this decrypted string with user-provided input for authentication within the 'infactory' command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the `infactory` menu which provides access to privileged commands, allowing for a range of operations including rebooting the system, hardware configuration and more.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a network request to the InRouter302 console via telnet or ssh, followed by issuing the `infactory` command and providing the hard-coded password, or bypassing the password prompt entirely to access the privileged menu and commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low-privileged user credentials to access the router's console and send the `infactory` command with the correct hardcoded password or find another way to bypass this password check.
