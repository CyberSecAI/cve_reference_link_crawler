- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer in the HTTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the HTTP server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability. Authentication is not required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the affected Actiontec WCB6200Q router. No authentication is needed.
