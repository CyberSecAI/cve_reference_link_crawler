Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The CheckUser extension's Special:Investigate feature did not properly check the revision deletion status of log events. It failed to store the log ID associated with logged actions, preventing it from looking up the suppression status.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is that suppressed log events were being exposed to users who did not have the necessary "oversight" permissions to view them.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** The CheckUser extension lacked proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to suppressed log data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized users, specifically checkusers without oversight permissions, could view sensitive information that was intended to be hidden, compromising user privacy and potentially leading to other issues.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Special:Investigate interface within the CheckUser extension. An attacker would need to have checkuser rights but not oversight permissions to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be a user with checkuser permissions on the wiki.
    *   They would need to access the Special:Investigate interface.
    *   They would specifically need to lack oversight permissions, as users with oversight would already have the ability to see suppressed log events.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided information gives a good insight into the vulnerability, detailing the underlying cause, the impact, and how the fix was implemented.
* The fix involved adding the log\_id to the CheckUser extension, allowing it to determine if a log event was suppressed or not.
* The fix was implemented across two commits that addressed the issue.
