### @bbovenzi **[bbovenzi](/bbovenzi)** commented [Feb 22, 2023](#issue-1595828271) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

`Airflow.run` is broken. It tries to start an executor. From the UI, users should use Clear instead. This PR removes the Run buttons from the UI (we will only show clear or mark failure/success).

Note: Since it is broken, I feel like this counts as a bug fix for 2.5.2. But if removing a UI element is too drastic I'm fine to move this to 2.6.0 instead

Before:
