### @timvisee **[timvisee](/timvisee)** commented [Mar 18, 2024](#issue-2192944730)

Fix arbitrary path traversal in our full snapshot API.

We now enforce snapshot files to be within their snapshot directories.

A simple integration test is added to assert this behavior.

### All Submissions:

* Contributions should target the `dev` branch. Did you create your branch from `dev`?
* Have you followed the guidelines in our Contributing document?
* Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](../../../pulls) for the same update/change?

### New Feature Submissions:

1. Does your submission pass tests?
2. Have you formatted your code locally using `cargo +nightly fmt --all` command prior to submission?
3. Have you checked your code using `cargo clippy --all --all-features` command?

Sorry, something went wrong.
