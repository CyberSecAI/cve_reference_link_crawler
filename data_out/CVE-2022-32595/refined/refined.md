- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incorrect bounds check within the widevine component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation, no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are required for exploitation.
