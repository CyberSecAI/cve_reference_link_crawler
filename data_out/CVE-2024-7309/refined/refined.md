{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'school' parameter of the entry.php file, allowing the injection of malicious script code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, and other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user can craft a POST request to entry.php with a payload in the 'school' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit a POST request to the vulnerable 'entry.php' file with a malicious script in the 'school' parameter."
