  "cve": "CVE-2021-26344",
  "description": "An out of bounds memory write when processing the AMD PSP1 Configuration Block (APCB) could allow an attacker with access the ability to modify the BIOS image, and the ability to sign the resulting image, to potentially modify the APCB block resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds memory write during the processing of the AMD PSP1 Configuration Block (APCB).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory write"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker with the ability to modify the BIOS image and sign the resulting image can exploit this vulnerability by modifying the APCB block.",
