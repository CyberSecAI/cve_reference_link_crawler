Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2140

**Vulnerability Description:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Ultimate Addons for Beaver Builder â€“ Lite plugin for WordPress, specifically within the Advanced Icons widget.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when rendering the Advanced Icons widget. Specifically, the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the vulnerable widget is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script injection: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into a page.
- The injected scripts will execute when a user views the page, potentially leading to:
  - Account compromise
  - Data theft
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the Advanced Icons widget of the plugin.
- An attacker could insert malicious code within the link field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges. This is because the attacker needs to be able to modify the content using the Beaver Builder editor.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is located in the file `ultimate-addons-for-beaver-builder-lite/modules/advanced-icon/includes/frontend.php`.
The following code snippet is vulnerable
```php
echo '<a class="adv-icon-link adv-icon-' . esc_attr( $icon_count ) . '" href="' . $icon->link . '" target="' . esc_attr( $icon->link_target ) . '" ' . sanitize_text_field( BB_Ultimate_Addon_Helper::get_link_rel( $icon->link_target, $icon->link_nofollow, 0 ) ) . '>'; //phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped
```
The `href` attribute was not being sanitized with `esc_url()`, allowing the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript such as `javascript:alert(1)`

**Patch:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.5.8 by applying `esc_url()` to the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag in the following code:
```php
echo '<a class="adv-icon-link adv-icon-' . esc_attr( $icon_count ) . '" href="' . esc_url( $icon->link ) . '" target="' . esc_attr( $icon->link_target ) . '" ' . sanitize_text_field( BB_Ultimate_Addon_Helper::get_link_rel( $icon->link_target, $icon->link_nofollow, 0 ) ) . '>'; //phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was reported by Patchstack and patched in version 1.5.8 of the plugin.
- Other files also had changes with unescaped attributes corrected, likely part of the broader security fix for this version.
