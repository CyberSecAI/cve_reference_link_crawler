Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Radio Player WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.0.73) is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows a malicious actor to cause the website to make requests to arbitrary domains, potentially controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information of other services running on the system. This is possible by making requests from the server to internal or external resources that would not normally be accessible.
*   **Arbitrary Request Execution:** A successful attack would allow execution of arbitrary website requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable Radio Player plugin. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the SSRF vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, requiring no specific privileges.
