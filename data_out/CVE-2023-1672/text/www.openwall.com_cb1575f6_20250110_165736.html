Subject: CVE-2023-1672: race condition in Tang exposes private keys to other
 processes

Hello all,

Tang (<https://github.com/latchset/tang>) is an open source project that
is used to bind data to network presence. It is commonly used along with
Clevis clients to provide for unattended LUKS decryption of server
storage volumes within the realms of a network, where a trusted Tang
server is situated.

CENSUS identified that the Tang software in versions 11, 12 and 13 (and
possibly previous versions) is vulnerable to a form of race condition,
where the Tang private keys become exposed for a small time window to
other users on the same host. The issue is tracked as CVE-2023-1672.
More information regarding the vulnerability can be found here:
<https://census-labs.com/news/2023/06/15/race-tang/>

Users are recommended to upgrade to Tang version 14 where the issue has
been sufficiently addressed.

Best regards,

Brian McDermott
