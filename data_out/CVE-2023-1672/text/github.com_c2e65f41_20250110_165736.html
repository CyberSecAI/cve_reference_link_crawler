This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix race condition when creating/rotating keys ([#123](https://github.com/latchset/tang/pull/123))

```
When we create/rotate keys using either the tangd-keygen and
tangd-rotate-keys helpers, there is a small window between the
keys being created and then the proper ownership permissions being
set. This also happens when there are no keys and tang creates a
pair of keys itself.

In certain situations, such as the keys directory having wide open
permissions, a user with local access could exploit this race
condition and read the keys before they are set to more restrictive
permissions.

To prevent this issue, we now set the default umask to 0337 before
creating the files, so that they are already created with restrictive
permissions; afterwards, we set the proper ownership as usual.

Issue reported by Brian McDermott of CENSUS labs.
