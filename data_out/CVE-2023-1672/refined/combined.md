Fix race condition when creating/rotating keys ([#123](https://github.com/latchset/tang/pull/123))

```
When we create/rotate keys using either the tangd-keygen and
tangd-rotate-keys helpers, there is a small window between the
keys being created and then the proper ownership permissions being
set. This also happens when there are no keys and tang creates a
pair of keys itself.

In certain situations, such as the keys directory having wide open
permissions, a user with local access could exploit this race
condition and read the keys before they are set to more restrictive
permissions.

To prevent this issue, we now set the default umask to 0337 before
creating the files, so that they are already created with restrictive
permissions; afterwards, we set the proper ownership as usual.

Issue reported by Brian McDermott of CENSUS labs.

Subject: CVE-2023-1672: race condition in Tang exposes private keys to other
 processes

Hello all,

Tang (<https://github.com/latchset/tang>) is an open source project that
is used to bind data to network presence. It is commonly used along with
Clevis clients to provide for unattended LUKS decryption of server
storage volumes within the realms of a network, where a trusted Tang
server is situated.

CENSUS identified that the Tang software in versions 11, 12 and 13 (and
possibly previous versions) is vulnerable to a form of race condition,
where the Tang private keys become exposed for a small time window to
other users on the same host. The issue is tracked as CVE-2023-1672.
More information regarding the vulnerability can be found here:
<https://census-labs.com/news/2023/06/15/race-tang/>

Users are recommended to upgrade to Tang version 14 where the issue has
been sufficiently addressed.

Best regards,

Brian McDermott

Package        : tang
Version        : 7-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-1672
Debian Bug     : 1038119

It was discovered that there was a race condition in Tang, a
network-based cryptographic binding server. This flaw resulted in a
small time window whereby newly-generated private keys were readable
by other processes on the same machine.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
7-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tang packages.

For the detailed security status of tang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tang>
