- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module "SoNice Etiquetage" lacks proper input sanitization when handling file paths for downloading labels. Specifically, it doesn't adequately restrict the path provided by the user, allowing path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-22**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)
    - Lack of permission control
    - Lack of control in pathname construction
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, including:
        - Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers.
        - Exfiltrating modules with all versions.
        - Stealing table prefixes to facilitate SQL injection.
        - Bypassing WAF/htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files, such as logs.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise.
    - Possible GDPR violation due to the potential exposure of personal information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires no privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. A guest user can initiate the attack remotely over the network.
