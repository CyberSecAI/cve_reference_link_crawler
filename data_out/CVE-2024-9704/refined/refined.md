Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9704

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'dvk_social_sharing' shortcode. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize shortcode attributes before outputting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page. This code will execute whenever a user accesses the page.
- **Account Takeover/Malicious Activity:**  The injected scripts could be used to perform various malicious actions, including redirecting users, stealing cookies/sessions, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'dvk_social_sharing' shortcode.
- **Malicious Attribute Values:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript by providing crafted attribute values within the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to create/edit posts containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Access to Post Editor:** Attacker needs the ability to create or edit content (pages/posts) where they can insert the vulnerable shortcode with malicious attributes.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the "Social Sharing (by Danny)" plugin up to and including 1.3.7 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.8. The fix involved escaping shortcode arguments before outputting them, preventing stored XSS.
- **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was reported by Peter Thaleikis.
- **CVSS Score:** 6.4 (Medium) with vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
