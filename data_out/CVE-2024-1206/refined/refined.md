### CVE-2024-1206
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of the 'recipes' parameter within the WP Recipe Maker plugin, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the code directly uses the input in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in database queries. This allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code, potentially altering or extracting sensitive data.
  - **Missing Authorization:** The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users with subscriber-level access or higher, indicating a missing authorization check on the import functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, or other confidential information.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Through SQL injection, an attacker can also modify data within the database, possibly leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes to the website's content.

**Attack vectors:**
  - The primary attack vector is through the 'recipes' parameter during the import process of the WP Recipe Maker plugin. This is an AJAX action, which allows a malicious actor to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least a subscriber role or above.
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send malicious requests.
