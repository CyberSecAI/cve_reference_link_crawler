[**View CSAF**](https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF)

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v4 8.7**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor**: Unitronics
* **Equipment**: Vision Legacy series
* **Vulnerability**: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to log in to the Remote HMI feature, where the PLC may be factory reset, stopped, and restarted.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Unitronics Vision Legacy series PLCs are affected:

* Vision 230: All versions
* Vision 280: All versions
* Vision 290: All versions
* Vision 530: All versions
* Vision 120: All versions

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format CWE-257**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/257.html)

Unitronics Vision Legacy series PLCs allow a remote, unauthenticated individual to retrieve the 'Information Mode' password in plaintext.

[CVE-2024-1480](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-1480) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2024-1480](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-1480). A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Israel

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Reid Wightman of Dragos reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Unitronics recommends users to:

* Change the default 1111 "Info Mode" password via SI 253.
* Restrict Ethernet access to the PLC having an Ethernet card using: 1. Implementing PLC multi-factor access using SB 314. 2. Apply a multi-factor VPN to protect the service from remote access.

Please follow Unitronics published recommendations or [contact Unitronics technical support](https://support.unitronics.com/index.php) for more information.

Dragos recommends users to restrict access to the PLC on TCP/20256 by either changing the default programmer port, or apply a multi-factor VPN to protect the service from remote access.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.

## 5. UPDATE HISTORY

* April 18, 2024: Initial Publication
* April 30, 2024: (Update A ) Added Unitronics Mitigations
