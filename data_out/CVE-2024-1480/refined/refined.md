Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1480

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Unitronics Vision Legacy series PLCs store the "Information Mode" password in a recoverable format, specifically plaintext. This allows for unauthorized retrieval of the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-257:** Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format. The primary vulnerability is the storage of the "Information Mode" password in plaintext, making it easily accessible to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in to the Remote HMI feature of the PLC.
- With access to the Remote HMI, an attacker can factory reset, stop, and restart the PLC. This can disrupt operations, cause equipment damage, and impact industrial processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access, allowing attackers to target systems from outside the local network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to retrieve the password, simplifying the exploitation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable PLC. This implies they would need access to the network where the PLC is connected.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Unitronics Vision 230, 280, 290, 530 and 120 series PLCs.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 and CVSS v4 score of 8.7, indicating high severity.
- Dragos reported the vulnerability to CISA and has also published an advisory, as well as detection rules for their platform.
- The affected PLCs are deployed worldwide, including in critical infrastructure sectors like Water and Wastewater.
- Mitigations include changing the default password, restricting network access, using multi-factor authentication, and implementing VPNs.
