- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure default configuration of the internal SFTP server. The SFTP server is not configured to limit file access to a single base directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure SFTP server configuration allowing access outside the user's home directory.
    - Default SFTP user group is the same as the TNMS service user, providing access to sensitive files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can read and modify sensitive TNMS files and configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the SFTP service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an attacker with valid SFTP credentials.
