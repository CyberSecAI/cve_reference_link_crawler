{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the BIOS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability occurs due to a race condition where a DMA transaction is performed with a specific timing during a System Management Interrupt (SMI). This allows a malicious actor to potentially alter the state of the system during the SMI handler execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution on the affected system. This can lead to complete system compromise including data theft, modification and denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local authenticated user with physical access to the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user with administrative privileges (high) and physical access to the system. They also need the capability to craft and time a DMA transaction to trigger the race condition during a System Management Interrupt (SMI)."
