WordPress 6.22BeaverBuilder Pro 2.7.0.5
I’ve spent a considerable amount of time trying out different plugins that will give me a category dropdown with the option to choose the categories for display, that would also work with BeaverBuilder / Beaver Themer. This one does the trick! It’s better than BB’s own Categories Widget, and very stable. Great work!

I used it on a big project of mine with Woocommerce categories. It works perfectly, it only needs an option for multiple childs selection. Hope it will be added with an update.
