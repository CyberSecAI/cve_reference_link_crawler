{
  "CVE-2024-26859": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "Root cause": "Race condition during EEH error recovery in the bnx2x driver.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Use-after-free due to concurrent access and freeing of SGE (Scatter/Gather Element) memory.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "System crash due to kernel NULL pointer dereference.",
      "Attack vectors": "The race condition occurs during EEH (Error Handling) error recovery and device reset triggered by transmit timeout logic.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trigger an EEH error condition which will cause a device reset. This can potentially be triggered through network activity causing driver timeouts."
