{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The function `get_bytes_per_element` could return 0 if no `source_format` matched, which would lead to division by zero errors when the result was later used as a denominator.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Division by zero"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to division by zero error.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when a specific combination of display modes and settings cause `get_bytes_per_element` to not match any cases, and return 0, leading to a divide by zero when its return value is used as a denominator.",
    "required_capabilities": "A user with the ability to control the display settings or mode."

  "fix": "The `get_bytes_per_element` function is modified to initialize the return value to 1 instead of 0, ensuring that it always returns a non-zero value.",
