In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Initialize get_bytes_per_element's default to 1

Variables, used as denominators and maybe not assigned to other values,
should not be 0. bytes_per_element_y & bytes_per_element_c are
initialized by get_bytes_per_element() which should never return 0.

This fixes 10 DIVIDE_BY_ZERO issues reported by Coverity.
