In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gsmi: fix null-deref in gsmi_get_variable

We can get EFI variables without fetching the attribute, so we must
allow for that in gsmi.

commit 859748255b43 ("efi: pstore: Omit efivars caching EFI varstore
access layer") added a new get_variable call with attr=NULL, which
triggers panic in gsmi.
