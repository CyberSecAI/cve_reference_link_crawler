- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically HTML elements, in confirmation pop-ups, leading to them being rendered instead of escaped.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization/escaping in confirmation pop-ups.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the confirmation pop-up, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions when a victim interacts with the pop-up.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious HTML into specific user input fields. The injected payload will be executed when the confirmation pop-up is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L) to the Checkmk instance. The attack also requires user interaction (UI:R) with the malicious payload.
