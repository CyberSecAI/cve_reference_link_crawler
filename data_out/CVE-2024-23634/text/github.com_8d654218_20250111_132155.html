For requests using the file, url or external upload methods with a zip mime type:

1. An exception will be thrown if the renamed .zip file is an existing directory instead of replacing the directory with the zip file.
2. If unzipping is unsuccessful or the primary store file could not be found, all uploaded files are deleted. Current behavior is to delete the zip file after successful unzipping only and leave the unzipped files behind if unzipping was partially successful or the primary store file could not be found.

Additionally, for requests using the external upload method with a zip mime type:

1. An exception will be thrown early if the external file is a directory since unzipping is guaranteed to fail later anyways.
2. The external file will be left as is and be copied in to GEOSERVER\_DATA\_DIR/data for unzipping rather than allowing potentially harmful manipulation of external files.

All other file upload requests are not affected.

* There is an issue in the [GeoServer Jira](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS/summary) (except for changes that do not affect administrators or end users in any way).
* Commit message(s) must be in the form `[GEOS-XYZWV] Title of the Jira ticket`.

| [@aaime](https://github.com/aaime), any chance you could take a look at this? This primarily fixes a potential security issue with the REST external upload method for ZIP files. |
