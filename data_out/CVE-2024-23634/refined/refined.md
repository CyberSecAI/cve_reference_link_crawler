  "CVE-2024-23634": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way GeoServer handles file renaming during external uploads of zip files via the REST API. Specifically, when a file is uploaded using the 'external' method, GeoServer attempts to rename it to a '.zip' file before unzipping. However, it fails to properly check if the source file is a directory, or if the destination already exists, before performing the rename, or if the rename is performed on a file or directory that is not within the datadir.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation: The application fails to validate the type of the file to be renamed or copied during the external upload process.",
      "Arbitrary File Rename: The application allows renaming files or directories that are outside of the intended data directory.",
       "Insufficient checks for destination resource type: When performing a rename or copy operation, the application does not verify that the destination resource is not a directory, or if the destination exists."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated administrator can exploit this vulnerability to rename arbitrary files and directories. This can lead to a denial of service by breaking GeoServer's configuration or data, and in some cases, reverting to default settings. Renaming non-GeoServer files could also result in a denial of service, depending on the specific environment.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the REST API's Coverage Store or Data Store upload endpoints using the 'external' upload method. This method is used when the file is located outside the GeoServer data directory.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with the ability to modify stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API. They must also know the path of a file or directory they want to rename on the server."
