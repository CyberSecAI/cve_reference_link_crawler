Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `node-eventsource` module not properly enforcing the same-origin policy during HTTP redirects. Specifically, when the module encounters a redirect to a different origin, it fails to strip sensitive headers like "Authorization" and "Cookie" from the subsequent request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak where sensitive headers (cookies, authorization tokens) intended for the original domain are inadvertently sent to a different domain during a redirect. This violates the same-origin policy.
- **Lack of Header Stripping:** The code failed to remove sensitive headers before following a cross-origin redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** An attacker controlling a malicious server could potentially receive sensitive user data (cookies, auth tokens) if the `node-eventsource` client is redirected to their server. This data could then be used to impersonate or otherwise compromise the user's account or session.
- **Session Hijacking:** With access to session cookies, an attacker could hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access to their account.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Authorization tokens, if leaked, could be used to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Redirects:** The attack vector involves exploiting HTTP redirects (301, 302, 307) to force the client to send sensitive headers to a different origin.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** While not explicit in this description, this vulnerability is also exploitable in a MitM attack where a malicious actor injects a redirect response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control of a Malicious Server:** The attacker must control a server that can receive the redirected request and capture the leaked headers.
- **Redirection Setup:** The attacker must be able to influence the server the client connects to initially to trigger a redirect to the attacker-controlled server.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**
- The provided content from github.com includes the specific code fix that was implemented for the vulnerability, showing how the sensitive headers `cookie` and `authorization` are removed before following redirects to a different origin. It also provides details about how the vulnerability was detected, through a failing test case that was implemented.
