Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2341

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin "Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin"

**Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.6.7.7

**Root Cause:** Insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of proper preparation in existing SQL queries. Specifically, the `keys` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection. The plugin fails to sanitize user input in the `keys` parameter before using it in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with "subscriber" access or higher can exploit this vulnerability to append additional SQL queries to existing ones. This allows them to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP requests by authenticated users. The vulnerability is triggered through a request containing the malicious SQL injection in the `keys` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.

**More Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is present in multiple files, where user-provided arguments are concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization (e.g., `includes/class-appointment-meta-model.php`, `includes/class-appointment-model.php`).
*   The fix involves using `$wpdb->prepare()` to properly sanitize and prepare SQL queries, which prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*  The specific vulnerable parameter is `keys`
*  The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Zając - CERT PL

**Patched Version:** 1.6.7.9
