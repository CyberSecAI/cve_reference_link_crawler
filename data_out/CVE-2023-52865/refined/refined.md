Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of the `mtk_alloc_clk_data()` function in the `drivers/clk/mediatek/clk-mt6797.c` file. If `mtk_alloc_clk_data()` fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, and the code proceeds to dereference this NULL pointer leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference which can lead to a crash. The code does not check if `mtk_alloc_clk_data` returns a valid pointer before using it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **System Crash:** If the memory allocation fails, the NULL pointer dereference will cause the kernel to crash resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Memory Exhaustion**: An attacker could potentially trigger this by exhausting the available memory resources of the system making the memory allocation fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to trigger the code paths that call `mtk_topckgen_init` or `mtk_infrasys_init` or `mtk_infrasys_init_early` in a scenario where memory allocation fails, which is possible under resource constrained environment.

**Additional notes:**

-   The provided patches add the necessary checks for the return value of `mtk_alloc_clk_data()`, preventing the NULL pointer dereference and handling the allocation failure by either returning an error or early exiting.
-   The fix involves adding `if (!clk_data) return -ENOMEM;` after calling `mtk_alloc_clk_data` in `mtk_topckgen_init` and `mtk_infrasys_init` and `if (!infra_clk_data) return;` after calling `mtk_alloc_clk_data` in `mtk_infrasys_init_early`.
