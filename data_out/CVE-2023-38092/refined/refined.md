- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `importDataObject` method, which lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient length validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having a target user visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability.
