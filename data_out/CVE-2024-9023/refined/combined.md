## Description

WebAuthn is a new way for you to authenticate in web. It helps you replace your passwords with devices like Passkeys, USB Keys, fingerprint scanners, Windows Hello compatible cameras, FaceID/TouchID and more. Using WebAuthn, you can login to your a website with a glance or touch.

When using WebAuthn, you just need to click once and perform a simple verification on the authenticator, then you are logged in. **No password needed.** If your device supports Passkey, your authenticator can roam seamlessly across multiple devices for a more convenient login experience.

WP-WebAuthn is a plug-in for WordPress to enable WebAuthn on your site. Just download and install it, and you are in the future of web authentication.

WP-WebAuthn also supports usernameless authentication.

This plugin has 4 built-in shortcodes and 4 built-in Gutenberg blocks, so you can add components like register form to frontend pages.

Please refer to the [documentation](http://doc.flyhigher.top/wp-webauthn) before using the plugin.

**PHP extensions gmp and mbstring are required.**

**WebAuthn requires HTTPS connection or `localhost` to function normally.**

You can contribute to this plugin on [GitHub](https://github.com/yrccondor/wp-webauthn).

Please note that this plugin does NOT support Internet Explorer (including IE 11). To use FaceID or TouchID, you need to use iOS/iPadOS 14+.

#### Security and Privacy

WebAuthn has become a W3C Recommendation since March 2019, which enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users using hardware authenticators. WebAuthn focuses on both security and privacy, it offers the possibility to create a secure authentication process without having to transfer any private data such as recognition data and fingerprint data. It will be the future of web authentication.

#### GDPR Friendly

When authenticating with WebAuthn, no private data will leave user’s device and no third-party involvement. The credentials transferred are not associate to any user’s information but only for authentication. It’s GDPR Friendly.

Simply the best login solution for Wordpress. They are working on adding MagicLink support. With Web-Auth(Passkeys) and as a fallback MagicLink, Passwords are finally gone for good

### Description

The WP-WebAuthn plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wwa\_login\_form shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
