Here's the information about CVE-2018-2797 extracted from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unbounded memory allocation during deserialization in the `TabularDataSupport` class of the JMX component in OpenJDK. This is due to insufficient checks on the data being deserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking during deserialization in the `TabularDataSupport` class. This allows an attacker to control the amount of memory allocated during the deserialization process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the unbounded memory allocation, an attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the memory resources of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Deserialization:** The attack vector is through the deserialization process of the `TabularDataSupport` class.
*   **Remote:** While not explicitly specified in all documents, some of them state that the issue may be remotely exploitable without requiring authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide data to an application that deserializes data using the vulnerable `TabularDataSupport` class. This can be achieved in various ways, like through a network connection or by manipulating files processed by the application.
*   No authentication is explicitly required according to the information.
*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious payload to trigger the unbounded memory allocation during deserialization.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified by the tracking number `8189985` within OpenJDK.
*   The vulnerability is present in IBM Java SE version 7 and 8, as well as Oracle Java SE.
*   The vulnerability is present in the JMX component of OpenJDK.
