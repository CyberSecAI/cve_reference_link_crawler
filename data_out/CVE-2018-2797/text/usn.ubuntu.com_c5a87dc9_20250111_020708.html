## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [openjdk-7](/security/cves?package=openjdk-7) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not correctly

perform merging of multiple sections for the same file listed in JAR

archive file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to modify

attributes in a manifest without invalidating the signature.

([CVE-2018-2790](/security/CVE-2018-2790))

Francesco Palmarini, Marco Squarcina, Mauro Tempesta, and Riccardo Focardi

discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not restrict which

classes could be used when deserializing keys from the JCEKS key stores. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a JCEKS key store to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-2794](/security/CVE-2018-2794))

It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK in some situations

did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing

deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-2795](/security/CVE-2018-2795))

It was discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK in some

situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when

performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-2796](/security/CVE-2018-2796))

It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK in some situations did

not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing

deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-2797](/security/CVE-2018-2797))

It was discovered that the AWT component of OpenJDK in some situations did

not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing

deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-2798](/security/CVE-2018-2798))

It was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK in some situations did

not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing

deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-2799](/security/CVE-2018-2799))

Moritz Bechler discovered that the RMI component of OpenJDK enabled HTTP

transport for RMI servers by default. A remote attacker could use this to

gain access to restricted services. ([CVE-2018-2800](/security/CVE-2018-2800))

It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the Hotspot component of

OpenJDK affecting confidentiality, data integrity, and availability. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an Java application that caused

a denial of service or bypassed sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2018-2814](/security/CVE-2018-2814))

Apostolos Giannakidis discovered that the Serialization component of

OpenJDK did not properly bound memory allocations in some situations. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-2815](/security/CVE-2018-2815))
