The provided content describes a fix for a resource leak vulnerability in the `pt_core_init()` function of the AMD PTDMA driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect error handling within the `pt_core_init()` function led to resources being leaked and attempts to free unallocated resources. Specifically, the `goto` statements in the error handling path were in the wrong order.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource leak: Due to the incorrect `goto` order in the error handling, allocated memory or other resources were not being freed if an error occurred during the initialization process.
- Use-after-free: Attempts were made to free resources that had not been allocated yet, leading to a potential use-after-free situation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The resource leak could eventually lead to system instability or denial of service if the initialization process failed repeatedly. While the use-after-free was not directly exploitable, it could lead to undefined behavior and potentially more serious vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the initialization of the PTDMA driver. An attacker could potentially exploit this by causing an error during this initialization process, for example, by providing invalid device configurations or causing a resource allocation failure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the initialization of the PTDMA driver with conditions that result in an error during the setup, requiring some level of control over the system.
