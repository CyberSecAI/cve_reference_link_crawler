- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition does not correctly restrict frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain. This can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient restriction of frame objects or UI layers from other applications/domains.
- **Impact of exploitation:** User confusion about which interface they are interacting with, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks where a malicious page is embedded in an iframe, making the user think they are interacting with the legitimate application.
- **Attack vectors:** Embedding a B2Bi page within an iframe on an attacker's website could potentially be an attack vector, though restricted by the `X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN` header in place.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website where they can embed the iframe. However, to fully exploit this, the attacker would need access to the same web server hosting B2Bi, which implies admin access, due to the presence of  `X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN` header. The attacker would have to be an administrator.
