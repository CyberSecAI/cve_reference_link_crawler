# Security Bulletin: IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition does not correctly restrict frame objects

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-42011](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/265508)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Sterling B2B Integrator | 6.2 |
| IBM Sterling B2B Integrator | 6.1 |

## Remediation/Fixes

B2Bi has already has X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN response header, which means that the content in an iFrame needs to come from same host to which the http request is made.  So the B2Bi page can’t be embedded in an iFrame in attacker’s web site unless the attacker has the access to the web server that hosts B2Bi, which means they would have to be an administrator.  Please note that this fix is already part of the affected releases of B2Bi and no update or patch is required.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

* Provide careful separation of duties between Server administrator and B2Bi privileged users who have access to B2Bi's dashboard.
* No patch or update is required to B2Bi because the affected releases already contain the restricting header.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
