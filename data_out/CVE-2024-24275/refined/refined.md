Root cause of vulnerability:
The Teamwire Windows desktop client, which is based on NW.js, failed to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied HTML code in various places like search results and group names before rendering it. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code due to the use of the AngularJS `trustAsHtml` function without prior sanitization.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) through unsanitized HTML in search results and group names.
- Remote code execution (RCE) due to the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript, which can be used to run OS commands using Node.js.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution on the victim's system. Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the victim's computer.
- Unauthorized access to the victim's system.
- Potentially full control over the victimâ€™s system.

Attack vectors:
- Crafted messages with malicious HTML/JavaScript are shown in search results.
- Specially crafted group names containing malicious HTML/JavaScript.
- Invitation of users to a group with a malicious name.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to be able to send messages or create groups within the Teamwire application.
- The attacker needs to entice a victim to view the message or the group with the injected malicious payload either via chat or search.
