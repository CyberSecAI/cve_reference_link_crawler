Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-39780:

**Vulnerability Summary:**

The ASUS RT-AX55 router is susceptible to command injection vulnerabilities. Multiple attack vectors exist, all stemming from the improper handling of user-supplied input within the device's firmware. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from how the `sbin/rc` binary processes certain HTTP request parameters and NVRAM variables. These parameters/variables are concatenated into shell commands, without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `sbin/rc` binary when processing specific HTTP request parameters and NVRAM variables. The code directly concatenates these values into system commands, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is command injection. Attackers can insert arbitrary shell commands via HTTP requests and NVRAM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the router, including:
  - Network manipulation.
  - Data exfiltration.
  - Installation of malware.
  - Denial-of-service.
  - The attacker could potentially gain a persistent foothold in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors involve sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/start_apply.htm` endpoint. The following parameters can be abused to achieve command injection:

1.  **`oauth_google_auth_code`:**
    - The value of this NVRAM parameter is concatenated to a system command within functions `FUN_000bc540` and `FUN_000b95b4`, triggered via `action_script=oauth_google_gen_token_email` and  `action_script=oauth_google_drive_gen_token` respectively.
2.  **`oauth_google_refresh_token`:**
    - The value of this NVRAM parameter is concatenated to a system command within the function `FUN_000bc648`, triggered via `action_script=oauth_google_check_token_status`.
3. **`oauth_google_drive_refresh_token`**:
    -The value of this NVRAM parameter is concatenated to a system command within the function `FUN_000bc864`, triggered via `action_script=oauth_google_drive_check_token_status`.
4.  **`qos_bw_rulelist`:**
    - The third substring of the value of this NVRAM parameter (split by ">") is written to the `/tmp/qos` script, and then executed via the `_eval` function, triggered via `action_script=restart_qos`.
5.  **`wan0_ipaddr`:**
    - The value of this NVRAM parameter is written to the `/jffs/ca_files/generate.sh` script, and then executed, triggered via `action_script=ipsec_force_gen_cert`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This generally implies being on the same local network as the router, or having remote access through a vulnerable service or VPN.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the router's web interface to exploit this vulnerability.

**Specific Exploits in Detail:**

The provided documents show that the attacker can set the NVRAM variables `oauth_google_auth_code`, `oauth_google_refresh_token`, `oauth_google_drive_refresh_token`,`qos_bw_rulelist`, and `wan0_ipaddr` using a crafted HTTP request. They then trigger command execution by sending another HTTP request containing specific `action_script` parameters. For example:

- To exploit `oauth_google_auth_code`:
  - Request 1 sets the `oauth_google_auth_code` NVRAM variable to  ``'telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 888'``.
  - Request 2 triggers the vulnerability by setting `action_script` to `oauth_google_gen_token_email`.

- To exploit `oauth_google_refresh_token`:
   - Request 1 sets the `oauth_google_refresh_token` NVRAM variable to ``'telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1111'``.
   - Request 2 triggers the vulnerability by setting `action_script` to `oauth_google_check_token_status`.

- To exploit `oauth_google_drive_refresh_token`:
   - Request 1 sets the `oauth_google_drive_refresh_token` NVRAM variable to ``'telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 999'``.
    - Request 2 triggers the vulnerability by setting `action_script` to `oauth_google_drive_check_token_status`.
-To exploit `qos_bw_rulelist`:
  - Request 1 sets `qos_bw_rulelist` to `1>A0:29:19:17:70:32>`telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 3333`>5120>0`
  - Request 2 triggers the vulnerability by setting `action_script` to `restart_qos`.
- To exploit `wan0_ipaddr`:
  - Request 1 sets `wan0_ipaddr` to ``ls>/tmp/888``.
  - Request 2 triggers the vulnerability by setting `action_script` to `ipsec_force_gen_cert`.

**Vulnerability Fix:**

The suggested fix is to filter out specific characters such as single quotes, backticks, semicolons, pipes, ampersands, dollar signs, line feeds, and double quotation marks from the vulnerable input fields (`oauth_google_auth_code`, `oauth_google_refresh_token`, `oauth_google_drive_refresh_token`,`qos_bw_rulelist` and `wan0_ipaddr`) before using them in shell commands.

In summary, CVE-2023-39780 describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities on the ASUS RT-AX55 router that can be exploited by authenticated users. The router firmware does not properly sanitize user-controlled parameters before using them in shell commands, which can result in full compromise of the device.
