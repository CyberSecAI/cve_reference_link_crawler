The provided content is related to CVE-2023-0094.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the plugin not properly validating and escaping shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post where the shortcode is embedded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page/post which will be executed in the victim's browser when the page is viewed. This can lead to various impacts, including:
- Stealing sensitive information
- Redirecting the user to malicious sites
- Performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode attributes. Specifically, the `map_height` attribute of the `vc_ugm_map` shortcode is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have at least the "contributor" role on the affected WordPress site. This role allows the user to create posts and pages, thus enabling them to embed the malicious shortcode. The WPBakery Page Builder plugin is also required for exploitation.
