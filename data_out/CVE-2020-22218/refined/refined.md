Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `_libssh2_packet_add()` function within the libssh2 library. Specifically, it involves a potential use of uninitialized memory due to an incorrect handling of `malloc(0)`. If `malloc(0)` does not return `NULL` and the allocated memory is subsequently used, it might result in access to uninitialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Use of Uninitialized Value: The core issue is that memory allocated by `malloc(0)` might not be initialized, leading to unpredictable data being used if the `payload` is used later.
- Potential Out-of-Bounds Access: The Debian security advisory mentions that this could allow attackers to access out-of-bounds memory, likely because the uninitialized data is used in an offset calculation or similar operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): According to both the Debian and NetApp advisories, successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition. This can be caused by the program crashing when trying to access invalid memory.
- Remote Information Disclosure: The Debian advisory also suggests that this vulnerability can lead to remote information disclosure. This is likely because uninitialized memory may contain sensitive data, which is then exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious SSH Server: An attacker controlling a malicious SSH server can trigger this vulnerability when a client connects to the server. The malicious server sends specific data or packet sequences that exploit the issue in the client-side libssh2 library.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control an SSH server that a vulnerable client connects to.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious packets that exploit the vulnerability in the client's libssh2 library.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix involves checking if `total_num` is zero and returning an error if it is, preventing the allocation and use of uninitialized memory when `malloc(0)` is called.
-   The vulnerability is present in libssh2 version 1.10.0.
-   The vulnerability was also addressed by moving the zero-length check for `total_num` to an earlier point in the code.

In summary, CVE-2020-22218 is a vulnerability in libssh2 where a malicious SSH server can trigger a use-of-uninitialized-value in the client, leading to a potential denial of service and information disclosure by sending crafted packets that exploit the library.
