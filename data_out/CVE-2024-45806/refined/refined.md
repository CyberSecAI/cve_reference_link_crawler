- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Envoy's default configuration treats all RFC1918 private address ranges as internal and trusted, allowing external clients to manipulate Envoy headers, specifically `x-envoy` headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate trust boundary configuration; default trust of RFC1918 addresses as internal which allows external sources to manipulate the `x-envoy` headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can bypass security controls, access sensitive data, or disrupt services within the mesh. This may include bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, altering routing decisions, and causing denial-of-service conditions.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attacks. An external attacker can send requests with malicious `x-envoy` headers to the Envoy proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Envoy proxy. They do not need any privileges or user interaction to perform the attack.

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description, specifically by mentioning the use of `x-envoy` headers and providing example curl command for the PoC. It also specifies that the default behavior is controlled by the runtime guard `envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`.
