{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Qualcomm LMh thermal driver was missing a check for SCM (Secure Channel Manager) availability during the probe stage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing check for SCM availability",
      "Potential null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference could occur if the SCM is not available when the driver attempts to access it, leading to a system crash or denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by loading the Qualcomm LMh thermal driver on a system where the SCM is not available.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to load the Qualcomm LMh thermal driver on the target system. No specific privilege is mentioned."
