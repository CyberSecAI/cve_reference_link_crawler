- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection and input sanitization/escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    - Lack of CSRF protection
    - Missing sanitization and escaping of user inputs
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the plugin settings. When an administrator visits the affected page in the WordPress admin panel, the malicious script will be executed in their browser. This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, redirection, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in administrator into opening a specially crafted HTML page that submits a form containing the malicious payload via a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to open a malicious HTML file. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
