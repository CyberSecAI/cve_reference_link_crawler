# ItemStack meta injection

High

[rubenwardy](/rubenwardy)
published
GHSA-hwj2-xf72-r4cf
Jan 26, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=5.3.0

## Patched versions

5.4.0

## Description

### Impact

If a mod saves user input in an ItemStack's metadata, then this can be abused by an attacker to add or modify other meta fields of the same item stack.

What this allows depends on what mods do with the meta data:

* If a mod uses meta to match keys with doors/chests, then this issue would allow attackers to craft keys to match any door/chest.
* Some mods create items from item meta, which would allow attackers to get unlimited quantities of arbitrary items.
* Denial of Service attacks.
* Before 5.2, this could be used for Remote Code Execution

### Patches

[b5956bd](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commit/b5956bde259faa240a81060ff4e598e25ad52dae)

### Workarounds

It is recommended that you update to Minetest 5.4+ or cherry-pick the patch.

Alternatively, you can workaround this issue by removing control characters before setting ItemStack meta:

```
value = value:gsub("[\x01\x02\x03]", "")
meta:set_string("key", value)
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H
