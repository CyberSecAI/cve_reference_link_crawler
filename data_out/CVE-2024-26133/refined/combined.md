## [Upgrade guide for EventStoreDB 22.10](#upgrade-guide-for-eventstoredb-22-10)

Packages are available on our [website](https://www.eventstore.com/downloads) and can be installed via [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/EventStore/EventStore-OSS), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/eventstore-oss), or [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/eventstore/eventstore/tags?page=1&name=22.10). See detailed commands/instructions for each platform.

### [Upgrade procedure](#upgrade-procedure)

An online rolling upgrade can be done from these versions of EventStoreDB, directly to 22.10.4:

* Previous versions of 22.10.x
* 22.6
* 21.10
* 20.10

Follow the upgrade procedure below on each node, starting with a follower node:

1. Stop the node.
2. Upgrade EventstoreDB to 22.10 and update configuration.
3. Start the node.
4. Wait for the node to become a follower or read-only replica.
5. Repeat on the next node.

As illustrated below:

![EventStoreDB upgrade procedure for each node](/assets/upgrade-procedure-HBEwsSQL.png)

EventStoreDB upgrade procedure for each node

Upgrading the cluster in this manner keeps the cluster online and able to service requests. There may still be disruptions to your services during the upgrade, namely:

* Client connections may be disconnected when nodes go offline, or when elections take place.
* The cluster is less fault-tolerant while a node is offline for an upgrade because the cluster requires a quorum of nodes to be online to service write requests.
* Replicating large amounts of data to a node can have a performance impact on the Leader in the cluster.

### [Breaking changes from version 21.10](#breaking-changes-from-version-21-10)

If you are upgrading from 21.10 or earlier, then you need to be aware of a breaking change in the TCP proto.

#### [Proto2 upgraded to Proto3 (TCP)](#proto2-upgraded-to-proto3-tcp)

The server now uses Proto3 for messages sent over TCP. This affects both replication and the legacy dotnet client.

EventStoreDB nodes on version 22.10 cannot replicate data to version 21.10 and below, but older nodes can still replicate to version 22.10 and above. Follow the [upgrade procedure](#upgrade-procedure) and ensure that the Leader node is the last node to be upgraded to avoid any issues.

### [Breaking changes from version 20.10](#breaking-changes-from-version-20-10)

If you are upgrading from 20.10, then you need to be aware of the following breaking changes:

#### [Log files rotation](#log-files-rotation)

Proper log rotation to on disk logging was added in 21.10. To accomplish this, the file names for both the stats and regular logs now include a date-stamp. i.e., log-statsYYYYMMDD.json and logYYYYMMDD.json, respectively.

#### [Intermediate Certificates](#intermediate-certificates)

Support for intermediate certificates was added in EventStoreDB version 21.10. If you are using intermediate certificates on a previous version and rely on the AIA URL to build the full chain, the configuration will no longer work and will print the following error on startup:

> Failed to build the certificate chain with the node's own certificate up to the root

Announcing a New Versioning Strategy

# Announcing a New Versioning Strategy

[Mat McLoughlin](https://www.kurrent.io/blog/author/mat-mcloughlin)  |  17 May 2020

There’s a lot of changes happening at Event Store, with an increase in team size and a new vision for taking Event Store to the next level.

As part of these changes, we are updating our versioning and release strategy. This is to make it clearer to our customers when they can expect a new release and how long we will support it for.

From the next release (that would have been called V6) we will commit to putting out three supported releases a year in February, June and October.

These releases will be versioned with the year and month, for example:

* 20.2
* 20.6
* 20.10

The February and June releases will be normal releases and we will support them for a period of 4 months. The October release will be our long term support (LTS) release and we will support them for a period of 24 months, until October 2022.

There will still be patch releases between major versions to address bugs and possible performance improvements.

Alongside these new versions, we are introducing nightly and stable builds. We will release the nightly builds each day and the stable builds on a semi-regular basis. We won’t support these builds but they will offer our customers the opportunity to get early access to new features. It will also give some visibility as to what is expected in the next official release.

The nightly builds are already [available](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/releases) and stable builds will become available soon after the 20.6 release.

Finally, we will be breaking cadence between the client and server releases. This is mainly due to us introducing clients in multiple languages such as .NET, Java, Go, and NodeJS. These clients will generally be versioned separately and newer clients will follow a more traditional strategy starting at v1.0.0. The latest released versions of each client will support both current and previous releases of EventStoreDB where possible. Each client will state in its own release notes which versions they support, and pre-release versions of clients may not support the full range of server versions.

# Potential password leak in the EventStoreDB Projections Subsystem

High

[hayley-jean](/hayley-jean)
published
GHSA-6r53-v8hj-x684
Feb 21, 2024

## Package

eventstore-oss

## Affected versions

<=23.10.0
<=22.10.4
<=21.10.10
<=20.10.5

## Patched versions

23.10.1
22.10.5
21.10.11
20.10.6

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been identified in the projections subsystem by the Event Store Ltd engineering team and a security release has been published for all LTS versions.

Only database instances that use custom projections are affected by this vulnerability.

User passwords may become accessible to those who have access to the chunk files on disk, and users who have read access to system streams. Only users in the `$admins` group can access system streams by default.

The vulnerability is present in EventStoreDB versions **v20** through **v23**. Each affected LTS release is receiving a patch with the fix, regardless of its current support status.

### Recommended Action

1. Upgrade EventStoreDB: Event Store Cloud customers follow the instructions in the [cloud upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/ops/#upgrading-eventstoredb-version). Otherwise follow the instructions in the [standard upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v23.10/upgrade-guide.html).
2. Reset the passwords for current and previous members of `$admins` and `$ops` groups.
3. If a password was reused in any other system, reset it in those systems to a unique password to follow best practices.

### Patches

This patch is to be applied to the following releases (you can also [read more about our versioning strategy](https://www.eventstore.com/blog/new-version-strategy)):

* Update ESDB 23.10.x to ESDB 23.10.1
* Update ESDB 22.10.x to ESDB 22.10.5
* Update ESDB 21.10.x to ESDB 21.10.11
* Update ESDB 20.10.x to ESDB 20.10.6

### Workarounds

If an upgrade cannot be done immediately, reset the passwords for current and previous members of `$admins` and `$ops` groups.

Avoid creating custom projections until the patch has been applied.

## [Resizing cluster nodes](#resizing-cluster-nodes)

Clusters can be expanded on-demand, to accommodate database growth, through the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc).

You can choose a larger or smaller node size. See also the cloud [sizing guide](/cloud/provision/sizing.html) for general guidance.

Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To resize a cluster in the console, navigate to the clusters view and select *Resize Cluster*.

![cluster list](/assets/Resize01DropDown-Dv-rnARH.png)

cluster list

On the detail page, specify the new cluster size and click on *Resize Cluster*.

![cluster_expand_detail](/assets/Resize02Selection-DerRSBJY.png)

cluster\_expand\_detail

Depending on your configuration, downtime may vary. Resizing a single-node ESDB instance requires downtime, while resizing a 3-node cluster uses a rolling upgrade, ensuring zero downtime.

In the cluster view, you can see that the resize is in progress.

![cluster_expand_detail](/assets/Resize04Progress-DWOv8nTG.png)

cluster\_expand\_detail

Once the resize operation is complete, the new cluster size will show in the cluster view.

![cluster_expand_detail](/assets/Resize05Complete-DjulMCKb.png)

cluster\_expand\_detail

esc

To resize a cluster with the command line, use the `clusters resize` command, where `--target_size` is the target instance size. Possible values are: F1, C4, M8, M16, M32, M64, M128.

```
esc mesdb clusters resize \
    --target-size C4 \
    --id cn7dd2do0aekgb8nbf20 \
    --project-id cn62uolo0aegb5icm0bg \
    --org-id 9bsv0s4qu99g029v5560
```
## [Upgrading EventStoreDB version](#upgrading-eventstoredb-version)

Clusters can be upgraded to a later version on-demand through the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc).

Note

Limitations:

* At this time, clusters can only be updated to a minor version of the current version. Upgrading to a major version is part of a future release. Until that point, if you need to upgrade to a major server version, you should perform a [backup](#manual-backup) and [restore](#restore-from-backup) to a new cluster. When restoring the backup, you can choose the EventStoreDB version you need. You can then switch your applications over to the connection string for the new cluster.
Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To upgrade a cluster in the console, navigate to the clusters view and select *Upgrade Cluster*.

To upgrade a cluster with the command line, use the `clusters upgrade` command, where `--target_tag` is the version you want to upgrade to. This must include the full version, e.g. 23.10.0.

```
esc mesdb clusters upgrade \
    --target-tag 23.10.0 \
    --id cn7dd2do0aekgb8nbf20 \
    --project-id cn62uolo0aegb5icm0bg \
    --org-id 9bsv0s4qu99g029v5560
```
## [Expanding disks](#expanding-disks)

Disks can be expanded on-demand, to accommodate database growth, through the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc)

See also the cloud [sizing guide](/cloud/provision/sizing.html) for general guidance.

Note

Limitations:

* on AWS expanding disks is subject to a rate limit, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyVolume.html) for more information.
Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To expand disks in the console, navigate to the clusters view and click on the *Expand Disks* icon.

On the detail page, specify the new disk size (as well as the disk IOPS and throughput when using the AWS GP3 disk type) and click on *Expand cluster disk*.

![cluster_expand_detail](/assets/disk_expand_detail-DmOEinR3.png)

cluster\_expand\_detail

esc

To expand disks with the command line, use the `clusters expand` command, where `--id` is the cluster id.

```
esc mesdb clusters expand \
    --disk-size-in-gb 16 --id c3fi17to0aer9r834480 \
    --project-id c3fhvdto0aepmg0789m0 \
    --org-id bt77lfqrh41scaatc180
```
## [Event Store Cloud Jobs](#event-store-cloud-jobs)

The Event Store Cloud runs scheduled jobs on the user's behalf. All of these jobs consist of a human-readable description and a schedule.

Currently, the following jobs are supported:

* [Scheduled backups](#scheduled-backups)

### [Job Schedules](#job-schedules)

The schedule format used by the Event Store Cloud CLI tool and API is a simplified subset of [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview), in the future we may support more cron features.

The supported subset is:

* for the first field, minute:
  + a wildcard `*`
  + a number between `0` and `59` (inclusive).
  + a rate, written as a wildcard divided by a number. E.g: `*/15`
* For the second field, hour:
  + a wildcard `*`
  + a number must be between `0` and `23` (inclusive)
  + a rate, written as a wildcard divided by a number. E.g: `*/1`
* for the third field, day of month:
  + a wildcard `*`
* for the fourth field, month:
  + a wildcard `*`
* for the fifth field, day of the week:
  + a wildcard `*`
  + a number between `0` and `7` (inclusive), Sunday to Saturday

```
 ┌───────────── Minute: wildcard, number (0 - 59), rate
 │ ┌─────────── Hour: wildcard, number (0 - 23), rate
 │ │ ┌───────── Day of the month: wildcard
 │ │ │ ┌─────── Month: wildcard
 │ │ │ │ ┌───── Day of the week: wildcard, number (0 - 7)
 │ │ │ │ │
 * * * * *
```

Note

Scheduled backups have a minimum frequency of 60 minutes. Currently, it is not possible to schedule backups more frequently.

#### [Examples:](#examples)

`0 */1 * * *` runs a job once an hour, at minute 00.

`0 12 * * 1` runs a job at 12:00 PM on Monday.

`30 13 * * 0` runs a job at 13:30 PM on Sunday.

## [Manual Backup](#manual-backup)

Backups can be created on demand using the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc).

Manually created backups appear in the console alongside backups created by scheduled jobs.

To see the status of the backup, navigate to the `Backups` section of the console. There you can see all backups created manually or by a scheduled job.

![one off backup](/assets/one_off_backup-BTAutuA-.png)

one off backup

You can customise the backup label using a combination of free-text and predefined variables:

* **index—**: the auto-incremented value with the number of backups. You can format it as:
  + decimal: `index:decimal` (*default*),
  + hexadecimal: `index:hex`.
* **cluster**: value from the cluster information:
  + description: `cluster:description` (*default*),
  + id: `cluster:id`,
  + cloud provider: `cluster:provider`
* **datetime**: timestamp of when backup was made. You can format it as:
  + UTC time: `datetime:utc` (*default*),
  + [RFC 822](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/#z28): `datetime:rfc822`,
  + [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time): `datetime:unix`,
  + [JSON](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): `datetime:json`,
  + [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339): `datetime:rfc3339`,

Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To create a backup in the console, navigate to the clusters view and click on the *Create backup* icon. In the popup, click the `Create one-off backup` button.

![take backup](/assets/take_backup-CBjSJv9T.png)

take backup

esc

To create a backup, use the `backups create` command:

```
esc mesdb backups create --description "on demand backup" \
    --source-cluster-id c1eut65o0aeu6ojco7a0 \
    --project-id btfjev2rh41scaatc1k0

BackupId("c1ev3l5o0aeu6ojco7b0")
```

To see the status of the backup use the `backups get` command:

```
esc mesdb backups get --project-id btfjev2rh41scaatc1k0 \
    --id c1ev3l5o0aeu6ojco7b0

Backup { id: BackupId("c1ev3l5o0aeu6ojco7b0"),
project_id: ProjectId("btfjev2rh41scaatc1k0"),
source_cluster_id: ClusterId("c1eut65o0aeu6ojco7a0"),
source_cluster_description: "Demo-Backup",
description: "on demand backup", size_gb: 8,
provider: Aws, region: "eu-central-1",
status: "available", created: "2021-03-26T14:38:12Z",
linked_resource: None }
```
## [Scheduled Backups](#scheduled-backups)

Scheduled backups can be created through the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc)

Scheduled backup jobs can be run as frequently as once an hour. After each successful backup, older backups created by the same job will be automatically deleted based on the provided configuration.

Note

Multiple scheduled backups can target the same cluster. However, if schedules overlap, one of the jobs will fail as the first backup job will already lock the cluster.

For example, you could create one scheduled backup that executes every hour, along with a second scheduled backup that executes once a week. Backups from these scheduled jobs are pruned independently regardless of their age, so if both saved a maximum of four backups, the oldest backup from the weekly job might be close to a month old, while the hourly job's backups would never be older than a fraction of a day.

Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To create a scheduled backup in the console, navigate to the clusters view and click on the *create backup* icon and then on `Create backup schedule`.

![take backup](/assets/take_backup-CBjSJv9T.png)

Choose a description, the frequency as well as the number of backups to keep before pruning. Finally, click the `Create backup schedule` button.

![take scheduled backup](/assets/take_scheduled_backup-CUDKJ07a.png)

Backups created this way appear in the console alongside backups created manually. All backups created by the same job will be grouped together in one row, which can be expanded by clicking the down arrow icon on the right side of the row.

![list of scheduled backup](/assets/one_off_restore_scheduled-DSz4vwag.png)

list of scheduled backup

To see the status on the scheduled backup jobs, navigate to the `Jobs` section of the console.

![backup jobs](/assets/jobs_scheduled_backup-Ce7KalzF.png)

backup jobs

There you can see all backups created by a job, as well as their history, which operations have failed (if any).

Note

A backup might fail, for instance, if a cluster is locked by another operation when the backup tries to run. Such a locking operation could be the disk expand or manual backup.

esc

A scheduled backup can be created using the Event Store Cloud CLI by using the `orchestrate` subcommand.

The following call will create a new scheduled backup of the cluster with ID `c196ogto0aeqohe3ommq`:

```
esc orchestrate jobs create \
    --description 'My Hourly Backup' \
    --schedule '0 */1 * * *' scheduled-backup \
    --description '{cluster} Hourly Backup {datetime:RFC3339}' \
    --max-backup-count 2 \
    --cluster-id c196ogto0aeqohe3ommq
```

For details on the scheduled field, see [Job Schedules](/cloud/ops/).

To list current jobs, run:

```
esc orchestrate jobs list
```

To view the history of a job, run:

```
esc orchestrate history list --job-id <job-id>
```
## [Restore from backup](#restore-from-backup)

Restores can be done on demand using the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc).

Note

Restoring a backup will create a new cluster

The topology of the new cluster does not need to be the same as the source of the backup: you can restore a 3 nodes cluster backup to a single node one. Do make sure that the disk size of the target cluster is large enough.

Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To restore a backup, navigate to the `Backups` section fo the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and click on the `Restore` icon of the backup you want to restore.

![one off restore backup](/assets/one_off_restore_scheduled-DSz4vwag.png)

one off restore backup

Backups are restored as new clusters. You will be then redirected to the usual provisioning page, where you can choose your cluster parameters. Note that you are not limited to restoring the backup to exactly the same cluster as the cluster for which the backup was taken. You can change the cluster topology, the database software version, and the instance size. You cannot restore between different cloud providers though.

![one off restore cluster backup](/assets/one_off_restore_cluster-CLPpynM9.png)

one off restore cluster backup

esc

As you cannot restore to the existing cluster, you should use the `source-backup-id` option of the `mesdb clusters create` command. When the backup id is provided, the CLI tool will create a new cluster using the provided backup.

Example: restoring the backup with ID `c10dvoarh41lb9otkdrg` to an F1 single node instance.

```
$ esc mesdb clusters create \
    --description "restore" \
    --source-backup-id c10dvoarh41lb9otkdrg \
    --instance-type F1 --disk-size-in-gb 10 \
    --disk-type GP2 --network-id c10dr5qrh41lbabqa2j0 \
    --projection-level off --server-version 20.10 \
    --topology single-node  --project-id c10d0h2rh41lba1v92k0
```

The output will display the new cluster ID:

```
ClusterId("c1mnqjdo0aembuk4ljo0")
```

You can then get the new cluster status with the following command:

```
$ esc mesdb clusters get --id c1mnqjdo0aembuk4ljo0 \
    --project-id c10d0h2rh41lba1v92k0 --json
```

The output will be similar to:

```
{
    "id": "c1mnqjdo0aembuk4ljo0",
    "organizationId": "bt77lfqrh41scaatc180",
    "projectId": "c10d0h2rh41lba1v92k0",

## [Protecting the cluster from removal](#protecting-the-cluster-from-removal)

Cluster can be protected from accidental removal using the [Cloud Console](https://console.eventstore.cloud/) and the [Event Store Cloud CLI](https://github.com/EventStore/esc).

This feature will require an extra step to unprotect the cluster before it will be possible to remove it.

Cloud ConsoleescCloud Console

To protect a cluster, navigate to the clusters view and click on the *Protect Cluster* icon.

To protect a cluster, you need to update a value of `protected` parameter to `true`:

```
esc mesdb clusters update --id cis4pcid60b5q96r8hm0 --protected true
```

To unprotect a cluster, you need to update it to `false`:

```
esc mesdb clusters update --id cis4pcid60b5q96r8hm0 --protected false
```

EventStoreDB Security Release: 23.10, 22.10, 21.10 and 20.10 For CVE-2024-26133

# EventStoreDB Security Release: 23.10, 22.10, 21.10 and 20.10 For CVE-2024-26133

[Event Store Team](https://www.kurrent.io/blog/author/event-store-team)  |  20 February 2024

* [Release Notes](https://www.kurrent.io/blog/tag/release-notes "More posts tagged Release Notes")

The official EventStoreDB security release for versions 23.10, 22.10, 21.10, and 20.10 is now available.

The versions in this security release contain an important security fix for [CVE-2024-26133](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/security/advisories/GHSA-6r53-v8hj-x684). We strongly recommend following the action items below and that all EventStoreDB installations be upgraded to one of these versions.

For Event Store Cloud customers, follow the instructions in the [cloud upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/ops/#upgrading-eventstoredb-version).

We are dedicated to ensuring all aspects of Event Store Ltd products are held to the highest security standards. We have therefore applied the fix to all affected LTS releases of EventStoreDB, including those that are currently out of support.  You can access and subscribe to any security alerts [here](/alerts).

This security fix is applied in the following versions (you can also [read more about our versioning strategy](/blog/new-version-strategy)):

Update ESDB 23.10.0 to ESDB 23.10.1
Update ESDB 22.10.x to ESDB 22.10.5
Update ESDB 21.10.x to ESDB 21.10.11
Update ESDB 20.10.x to ESDB 20.10.6

If you need help planning your upgrade or want to discuss support, please [contact us](/contact).

## EventStoreDB Vulnerability CVE-2024-26133

A vulnerability has been identified in the projections subsystem by the Event Store Ltd engineering team and has been fixed in this release.

Only database instances that use custom projections are affected by this vulnerability.

User passwords may become accessible to those who have access to the chunk files on disk, and users who have read access to system streams. Only users in the $admins group can access system streams by default.

## Recommended action

1. Upgrade EventStoreDB: Event Store Cloud customers follow the instructions in the [cloud upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/ops/#upgrading-eventstoredb-version). Otherwise follow the instructions in the [standard upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v23.10/upgrade-guide.html).
2. Reset the passwords for current and previous members of $admins and $ops groups.
3. If a password was reused in any other system, reset it in those systems to a unique password to follow best practices.

## Where can I get the packages?

Event Store Cloud customers should upgrade to the latest LTS package. For more details, see the [cloud upgrade guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/ops/#upgrading-eventstoredb-version).

Downloads for versions 23.10 and 22.10 are available on our [website](/downloads/).
