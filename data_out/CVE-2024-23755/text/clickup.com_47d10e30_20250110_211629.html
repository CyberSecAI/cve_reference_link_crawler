## DEFINITIONS

#### CVEÂ

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a dictionary of common names (CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation.

##### CVSSÂ

Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a vendor agnostic, industry open standard designed to convey the severity of a vulnerability. CVSS scores may be used to determine the urgency for update deployment within an organization and can range from 0.0 (no vulnerability) to 10.0 (critical). ClickUp uses CVSSv3 in vulnerability assessments to present an immutable characterization of security vulnerabilities. ClickUp assigns all relevant security vulnerabilities a non-zero score. Customers performing their own risk assessments of vulnerabilities that may impact them can benefit from using the same industry-recognized CVSS metrics.

#### MitigationsÂ

Mitigations are existing conditions that a potential attacker would need to overcome to mount a successful attack or that would limit the severity of an attack. Examples of such conditions include default settings, common configurations and general best practices.Â
WorkaroundsÂ
Workarounds are settings or configuration changes that a user or administrator can apply to help protect against an attack.
