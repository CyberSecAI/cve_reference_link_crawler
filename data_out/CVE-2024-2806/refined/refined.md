{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `addWifiMacFilter` function in Tenda AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi firmware is vulnerable to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `deviceId` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to provide an overly long string that overwrites the return address on the stack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By overwriting the return address, an attacker can control the execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution. This could allow the attacker to take complete control of the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint with an overly long value for the `deviceId` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, implying network access to the device."
