- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the Data Warehouse component of OnCommand Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to access the Data Warehouse component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can view limited configuration data, view operations, or perform privileged operations on the administrative interface. This could potentially lead to a disruption of service for the OnCommand Insight Data Warehouse. However, the attacker cannot access collected data, manage other Data Warehouse users, or access other OnCommand Insight components.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) with low attack complexity (AC:L), requiring no user interaction (UI:N) and no privileges (PR:N) .
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
