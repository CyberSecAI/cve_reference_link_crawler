Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45236:

**CVE-2024-45236**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Fort not properly handling signed objects with empty `signedAttrs`. Specifically, Fort accesses the elements of the `signedAttrs` set without checking if it's empty.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a missing check for an empty set before accessing its elements, leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a crash, potentially leading to the unavailability of Route Origin Validation.
*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious RPKI repository, which descends from a trusted Trust Anchor, can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty `signedAttributes` field.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control an RPKI repository that a Fort validator instance trusts. This allows the attacker to serve malicious RPKI objects to the vulnerable validator.
