{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of authorization checks on direct requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The application fails to verify if a user is authorized to perform certain actions or if they have been authenticated. This allows for direct access to resources without proper authorization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can export the application's source code which includes C#, JavaScript, and CSS files. This can expose sensitive information and potentially lead to further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct requests to application resources.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make direct requests to the application, likely via the web interface, and does not need to be authenticated or authorized."
