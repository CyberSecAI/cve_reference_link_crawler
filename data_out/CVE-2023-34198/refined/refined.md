Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When an interface configured in "DHCP client mode" is turned off, the network objects (IP addresses) associated with that interface are incorrectly changed to "any" in the firewall filter rules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of network objects associated with DHCP client interfaces when the interface is disabled. Specifically, the network object should not be treated as "any".
- This incorrect behavior affects how filter rules are applied.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Filter rules using network objects associated with a disabled DHCP client interface will now apply to any network traffic rather than being restricted to the specific IP range provided by DHCP.
-  This could lead to a bypass of intended firewall rules and might allow unintended network traffic based on these rules, which could lead to a loss of Integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is "Adjacent Network".
- An attacker in the adjacent network may potentially exploit the vulnerability if specific filter rules are configured and then the interface is disabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the filter rule configuration and the state of the DHCP interface of the targeted system.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory notes that using network objects created from DHCP interfaces in filter rules is unusual.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 and CVSS temporal score of 3.9.
- The fix is available in specific versions of Stormshield Network Security (SNS).
- A workaround is provided, suggesting either assigning a temporary IP address rather than DHCP, or not using interface network objects when the interface is disabled.
