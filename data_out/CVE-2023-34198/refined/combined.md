| Analysis | Impacted version |
| --- | --- |
| If a filter rule is created with a network object created from an interface in â**DHCP client mode**â, and that interface is turned to **off**, the network object is considered as â**Any**â.  **Note**: network object created from an interface in â**DHCP client mode**â (like ânetwork\_) covers adjacent network provided by the DHCP service. So itâs typically restricted to distributed IP and his gateway, provided by the ISP. Usage of this network object in filtering rules is really unusual.  Â  Â | * SNS 1.0.0 to 3.7.36 * SNS 3.8.0 to 3.11.24 * SNS 4.0.0 to 4.3.18 * SNS 4.4.0 to 4.6.5 * SNS 4.7.0 |

| Workaround solution | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| * If you disable an interface in DHCP client mode, set a temporary IP address rather than DHCP. * Do not use interfaceâs network objects if the interface is in DHCP mode and disabled. | The following versions fix this vulnerability   * 3.7.37 * 3.11.25 * 4.3.19 * 4.6.6 * 4.7.1 |
