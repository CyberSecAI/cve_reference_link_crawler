- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The bulk import feature allows a privileged user to upload files to the root installation directory of the system without proper validation or sanitization of the file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
    - Improper handling of file paths during the bulk import operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution or tamper with system files by replacing specific files in the root installation directory.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged user account.
