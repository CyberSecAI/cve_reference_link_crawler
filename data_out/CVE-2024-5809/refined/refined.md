Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WP Ajax Contact Form plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter (`eid`) before outputting it back into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page viewed by an administrator. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:

*   Session hijacking: Stealing the admin's session cookie to gain unauthorized access.
*   Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the website.
*   Malware distribution: Redirecting the admin to a website that downloads malicious software.
*   Data theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data accessible to the admin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is triggered when a logged-in administrator visits a malicious HTML page.
*   The malicious page contains a form that uses a crafted `eid` parameter.
*   The form is automatically submitted, sending the malicious script to the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page or control a page where they can inject a malicious form that will be automatically submitted to the vulnerable page within the targeted wordpress install.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening the malicious page, usually via social engineering techniques (e.g. sending a link via email or chat) .

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in WP Ajax Contact Form plugin versions 2.2.2 and below.
* There is no known fix for this vulnerability as of the provided information.
* The provided proof of concept code shows how an attacker can inject the `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload, demonstrating a successful XSS execution.
