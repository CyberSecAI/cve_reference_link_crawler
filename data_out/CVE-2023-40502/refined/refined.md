- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the `cropImage` command implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal leading to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the affected system. This occurs in the context of the SYSTEM user.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability without requiring authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is needed, thus the attacker could be unauthenticated on the network.
