- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe handling of file protocol handlers, leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can persuade a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. The attacker needs to observe the transmitted traffic in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to craft a malicious link that triggers the application's file protocol handler.
    - Ability to observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position.
