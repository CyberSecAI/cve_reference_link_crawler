For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. The updates are part of the Cisco Webex service, and no customer action is necessary to get these software updates. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-app-ZjNm8X8j>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affected Cisco Webex App and were addressed through the Cisco Webex service, which is cloud based. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20395: Cisco Webex App Session Token Exposure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.  This vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwj36941](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36941), [CSCwj36943](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36943)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20395Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  **CVE-2024-20395: Cisco Webex App Windows Protocol Handler Credential Exposure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.  This vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwj36947](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36947)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20396Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has addressed these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex, which is cloud based. No user action is required.  Customers who need additional information are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank Maxime Escourbiac of CERT Michelin and Yassine Bengana of Abicom for reporting these vulnerabilities.
