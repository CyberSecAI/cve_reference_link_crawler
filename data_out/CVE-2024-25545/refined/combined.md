Arbitrary Code Execution in Weave Desktop

 [Raw](/khronokernel/b68709335aa097752423f5d6844c3aa3/raw/7b0ee8555400a80ef5ebf4fc50098e967ee798fb/CVE-2024-25545.md)

[**CVE-2024-25545.md**](#file-cve-2024-25545-md)

# CVE-2024-25545 - Arbitrary Code Execution in Weave Desktop

On January 9th, 2024, Weave was notified through their [responsible disclosure system](bugbounty%40getweave.com) that Weave version 7.78.10 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution and as of April 9th, 2024, is still vulnerable.

Note while Weave does list a [paid bug bounty on their site](https://www.getweave.com/en-ca/security/), no compensation was given.

## Affected Products

* Weave Desktop
  + Affected: All current versions (7.78.10 through 7.84.1 confirmed)
  + Fixed: N/A

## Vulnerability Details

Due to Weave Desktop being built with the nwjs (version 92.0.4515.107), the framework implements the ability to pass arbitrary JavaScript to the application. With TCC inheritance in macOS, the malicious script gain additional privileges such as Microphone and Camera access normally blocked by the operating system for user approval.

Additionally any systems that rely on code signature checks can be spoofed into using Weave's ID, which can be used to bypass security checks.
