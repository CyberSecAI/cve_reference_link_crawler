Root cause of vulnerability: Weave Desktop is built with nwjs, which allows the passing of arbitrary JavaScript to the application.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: 
  - Arbitrary code execution due to the use of nwjs.
  - TCC inheritance in macOS allows malicious scripts to gain additional privileges like Microphone and Camera access.
  - Code signature checks can be bypassed by spoofing Weave's ID.

Impact of exploitation: 
  - Arbitrary code execution on the affected machine.
  - Unauthorized access to Microphone and Camera on macOS.
  - Bypassing of security checks relying on code signatures.

Attack vectors: Passing arbitrary JavaScript to the Weave Desktop application.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to pass arbitrary JavaScript to the Weave Desktop application.
