The provided content is related to CVE-2022-47194.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is insecure default settings in Ghost CMS, which allows stored XSS via the "twitter" field in user profiles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the user's "twitter" field.
- Insecure default installation of Ghost CMS where user-created pages can have equal privileges to administrator users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to administrator via XSS.
- Arbitrary Javascript injection.
- A malicious user can inject Javascript, which will execute when an administrator visits or previews a post by the attacker. This enables the attacker to perform administrative tasks via XSS, allowing them to gain full control of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with low-level access (e.g., Contributor) can send a crafted HTTP request to modify the user's profile, specifically the "twitter" field.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a higher-level user previews or visits a post by the malicious user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in Ghost CMS.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Ghost CMS server.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator into visiting a page where the malicious Javascript is executed.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects malicious Javascript into the "twitter" field of a user profile via a PUT request to `/ghost/api/admin/users/{user_id}/?include=roles`.
- The payload `</script><script>alert('XSS')</script>` is used as an example.
