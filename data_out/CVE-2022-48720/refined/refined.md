The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48720.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The macsec netdev notify handler was not properly handling the `NETDEV_UNREGISTER` event when hardware offloading was enabled. It was only releasing software resources but not notifying the underlay driver to clean up its macsec offload resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Resource leak in the macsec driver when hardware offloading is used and the network device is unregistered. Specifically, MACsec hardware offload resources were not being released when a network device was unregistered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The resource leak could potentially lead to system instability or denial of service if enough resources are leaked.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by unregistering a network device that has MACsec hardware offloading enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to unregister network devices.
