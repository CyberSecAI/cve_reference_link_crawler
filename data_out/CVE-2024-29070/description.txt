On versions before 2.1.4,Â session is not invalidated after logout. When the user logged in successfully, the Backend service returns "Authorization" as the front-end authentication credential. "Authorization" can still initiate requests and access data even after logout.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4
