- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The session is not invalidated after logout in Apache StreamPark versions prior to 2.1.4.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure session management where the "Authorization" token provided after successful login remains valid even after the user logs out.
- **Impact of exploitation:** After a user logs out, their "Authorization" token remains active and can be used to make unauthorized requests, potentially accessing data. This means a malicious actor could potentially continue to access the user's account even after they have logged out if they have access to this token.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can exploit this by gaining access to the "Authorization" token. This can potentially happen if the token is stored insecurely or is leaked. Then, the malicious actor can use this token to access data even after the original user logged out.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid "Authorization" token, which is provided by the backend service upon successful login. The attacker can obtain the token through means such as eavesdropping on network communication. They can then use the token even after the original user has logged out to access data.
