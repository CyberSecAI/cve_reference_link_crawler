Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks within the Tutor LMS Pro plugin for WordPress. Specifically, several functions such as `treport_quiz_atttempt_delete` and `tutor_gc_class_action` lack proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of authorization checks on critical functions. This means that the plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to execute certain actions.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Insecure Direct Object Reference, which means that a user is able to access resources/perform actions they should not have access to by directly referencing their identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions:** An attacker can perform administrative actions on the site, such as deleting comments, posts, or users, and viewing notifications, even with low-level access (Subscriber+).
*   **Potential for Site Compromise:** The ability to perform administrative functions can lead to significant damage to the site, including data loss, defacement, or complete takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs subscriber-level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least the subscriber role.
*   The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable functions of the Tutor LMS Pro plugin, possibly by crafting malicious HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects Tutor LMS Pro versions up to and including 2.7.2.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.3.
* The CVSS score is 7.1, which is considered "High."
* The vulnerability was discovered by Thanh Nam Tran.
