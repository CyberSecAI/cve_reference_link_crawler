{
  "CVE-2022-21324": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing Data Node jobs within MySQL Cluster, which can lead to a read past the end of an array.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information by reading beyond the bounds of an array. This can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication, requiring no special privileges other than network access to the vulnerable service. The advisory indicates this requires adjacent network access as opposed to remote, meaning the attacker needs to be within the same network."
