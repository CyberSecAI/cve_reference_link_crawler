- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code embedded within a vulnerable parameter (`upload_mode`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the crafted URL.
