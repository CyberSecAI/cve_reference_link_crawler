Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient filtering of user-supplied input in the `facid` parameter within the `card.php` file. The application uses a blacklist approach with regular expressions to filter out potentially malicious JavaScript event handlers. However, the `onbounce` event, used with the `marquee` HTML tag, was not included in the blacklist, allowing for a reflected XSS attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it echoes unfiltered user input from the `facid` parameter directly into the HTML output within the `formconfirm()` function.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application uses regular expressions to filter out dangerous event handlers. This approach is not comprehensive, and missing a single event like `onbounce` allowed for exploitation.
- **Blacklisting Approach:** Relying on a blacklist for sanitization instead of a whitelist is an inherently weak practice. It is difficult to anticipate and block all potential malicious patterns.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they click the crafted link.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting users to phishing sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL by injecting a JavaScript payload into the `facid` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker lures an authenticated user into clicking the malicious URL.
- **Browser Execution:** When the user clicks the crafted URL, the browser renders the HTML, causing the injected JavaScript code to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Dolibarr application to access the vulnerable `card.php` page.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the specific XSS payload, including the `marquee` tag with the `onbounce` event.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to click the manipulated URL.

**Additional Details:**
- **Filter Bypass:** The blog post describes how the `onbounce` event handler was missed by the regular expression filtering in the `testSqlAndScriptInject` function.
- **Specific Payload:** The provided payload uses the `marquee` tag with `behavior=alternate` and `onbounce` attributes to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.1 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
- **Mitigation:** The vendor has addressed the vulnerability in version 19.0.2 of Dolibarr by using the `GETPOSTINT` function to ensure that only integer data is used for `facid` parameter.
