- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `screenshot_sync` file of the `fredsmith utils` product's `Filename Handler` component.  An unspecified input leads to a predictable state.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable state vulnerability (CWE-341), potentially also information disclosure (CWE-200) and improper access control (CWE-284)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation of the vulnerability impacts confidentiality, where attackers can predict system states.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulation of the `screenshot_sync` filename with an unspecified input, leading to a predictable state. Attackers can potentially observe the system or network state to predict outputs. The attack can be partially remote.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the capability to manipulate the input to the `screenshot_sync` filename. Additionally, they need to be able to observe the system's state such as time and process IDs.
