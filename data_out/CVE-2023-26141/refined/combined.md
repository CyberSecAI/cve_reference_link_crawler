I just cherry picked it into the 6-x branch so it'll be in a future 6.5.10 release. No ETA for that.

The CVE seems misleading. This is only client-side validation and nothing is stopping me from making these requests myself, the DoS is still present.

I would think/hope that most already have the dashboard behind a rails constraint or something similar like the build-in enterprise authorization feature.

7.x does not seem to be backwards compatible. This seems like it should merit a prompt release for 6.x.

Agree. But for those of us who use Github Dependabot (or bundler-audit), this getting flagged as high raises questions and awkward conversations with anyone we need to share the reports with (ie: customers).

Upgrading to 7 will be a large effort for us.

I agree that it is quite low severity but I have no idea how to tell dependabot that and right now we have dependabot turned off because of this which is dangerous. Perhaps the greater issue here is that v7 is not backwards compatible and the transition guides are incomplete / confusing.

|  | When testing Sidekiq version 6.5.8 and reviewing the code for the current main release on their Github, the same functionality exists, which should indicate the newest version is vulnerable as well. |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | In the version 6.x of their codebase the vulnerability is on line 6 of https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/6-x/web/assets/javascripts/dashboard.js: |
|  | var timeInterval = parseInt(localStorage.sidekiqTimeInterval) || 5000; |
|  |  |
|  | If you look at the latest release in MAIN on line 60 in https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/web/assets/javascripts/dashboard-charts.js the localStorage.sidekiqTimeInterval is parsed using parseInt and set as the delay: |
|  | this.delay = parseInt(localStorage.sidekiqTimeInterval) || 5000; |
|  | this.startPolling(); |
|  | document.addEventListener("interval:update", this.handleUpdate.bind(this)); |
|  |  |
|  | This is then used on line 68 to set the polling interval: |
|  | this.\_interval = setInterval(this.poll.bind(this), this.delay); |
|  |  |
|  | When inserting values such as 1 here it correlates to 1000 polling requests a second (by default if nothing is set it is set to a value of 5000 which is 5000 milliseconds/5 seconds). The localstorage value sidekiqTimeInterval is not sanitized user input which causes a Denial of Service if a value such as "1", is used. The heavy traffic from the polling makes the site unusable and can potentially bring the site and server down. |
|  |  |
|  | The front end HTML input type="range" code for the app sets maximum and minimum values, but the local storage value being used doesn't get validated in the back end code to prevent abuse. For example, see line 18 https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/web/views/dashboard.erb: |
|  | <input id="sldr" type="range" min="2000" max="20000" step="1000" value="5000"/> |
|  |  |
|  | The "attacking" POC payload entered into the local storage value is "1". This is entered by loading the main/default Sidekiq page dashboard, opening developer tools in the browser, going to Memory-->Local Storage and changing the only local storage value there is to "1". Reload/refresh the page and then the site tries to load and freezes uncontrollably because of the 1000 polling requests a second |
|  |  |
|  | This vulnerability impacts the availability of the entire site using Sidekiq. The value that is not sanitized user input is in local storage, not the cookie. If cross-site scripting is found anywhere in the application an attacker can run JavaScript to pull or insert values in the local storage value, causing the Denial of Service. In my testing, I'm seeing at minimum hundreds/thousands of requests per second. |
|  |  |
|  | This specific instance of Sidekiq is running on an enterprise grade server that can take thousands of requests a second. Also, I'm not entirely sure what would happen if multiple users that had access to the dashboard performed the POC payload in the localstorage value. My guess is the attack would be amplified by 1000 requests a second per user. |

#### Introduced: 7 Sep 2023

[CVE-2023-26141  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26141) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `sidekiq` to version 6.5.10, 7.1.3 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption due to insufficient checks in the `dashboard-charts.js` file. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `localStorage` value which will cause excessive polling requests.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.9 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
