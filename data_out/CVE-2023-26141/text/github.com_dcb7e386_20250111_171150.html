I just cherry picked it into the 6-x branch so it'll be in a future 6.5.10 release. No ETA for that.

The CVE seems misleading. This is only client-side validation and nothing is stopping me from making these requests myself, the DoS is still present.

I would think/hope that most already have the dashboard behind a rails constraint or something similar like the build-in enterprise authorization feature.

7.x does not seem to be backwards compatible. This seems like it should merit a prompt release for 6.x.

Agree. But for those of us who use Github Dependabot (or bundler-audit), this getting flagged as high raises questions and awkward conversations with anyone we need to share the reports with (ie: customers).

Upgrading to 7 will be a large effort for us.

I agree that it is quite low severity but I have no idea how to tell dependabot that and right now we have dependabot turned off because of this which is dangerous. Perhaps the greater issue here is that v7 is not backwards compatible and the transition guides are incomplete / confusing.
