## Added

* Count datastore queries involved in Check resolution metadata ([#880](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/880))

  OpenFGA request logs and traces will now include a field `datastore_query_count` that shows how many queries were involved in a single Check resolution.
* Histogram metric to report the `datastore_query_count` per Check ([#924](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/932))

  This new metric can be used to report percentiles of the number of database queries required to resolve Check requests.
* Check request duration histogram labeled by method and datastore query count ([#950](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/950))

  The `request_duration_by_query_count_ms` metric reports the total request duration (in ms) labelled by the RPC method and ranges of observations for the `datastore_query_count`. This metrics allows operators of an OpenFGA server to report request duration percentiles for Check requests based on the number of database queries that were required to resolve the query.
* Optimize Check to avoid database lookups in some scenarios ([#932](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/932))
* CachedCheckResolver for caching Check subproblems ([#891](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/891))

  This experimental feature adds new caching capabilities to the OpenFGA server. It is an "opt-in" feature and thus must be enabled. To enable this feature you must specify the experimental flag `check-query-cache` and set the `--check-query-cache-enabled=true` flag.

  ```
  openfga run --experimentals check-query-cache --check-query-cache-enabled=true
  ```
* Server request logs now include the `user-agent` ([#943](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/943))

## Changed

* Default Check and ListObjects concurrency read limits ([#916](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/916))

  In our last release [v1.3.0](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.3.0) we modified the default behavior of Check and ListObjects such that it limits/restricts the degree of concurrency that is allowed for a single request. This change was unintended. This release reverts the default behavior back to unbounded concurrency limits (the prior default). The change mostly affects those using OpenFGA as a library.
* Bumped up to Go 1.21 ([#952](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/pull/952))

## Security

* Patches [CVE-2023-40579](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-jcf2-mxr2-gmqp) - see the CVE for more details
