- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `HiAdvancedGiftWrappingGiftWrappingModuleFrontController::addGiftWrappingCartValue()` method in the "Gift Wrapping Pro" module uses unsanitized input from `Tools::getValue('id_cart')` directly in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). The code fails to properly sanitize the `id_cart` parameter before using it in a database query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admin's AJAX scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP requests to the vulnerable front controller. The path to the module's controller can be concealed during exploitation, making it difficult to detect in standard frontend logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They can trigger the SQL injection with a simple HTTP request. The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
