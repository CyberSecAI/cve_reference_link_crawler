- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The encryption key is printed to the console when a privileged user executes a script to replace the Brocade SANnav Management Portal standby node.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (encryption key) via console output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could gain access to the encryption key, potentially leading to further compromise of the system, though the impact is classified as Confidentiality: High, Integrity: None, Availability: None.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires access to the console where the vulnerable script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a privileged user with access to the Brocade SANnav console and the ability to execute the script to replace the standby node.
