|  |  | # CVE-2024-47070 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \_Reported by [@efpi-bot](https://github.com/efpi-bot) from [LogicalTrust](https://logicaltrust.net/en/)\_ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Password authentication bypass via X-Forwarded-For HTTP header |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Summary |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability allows bypassing policies by adding X-Forwarded-For header with unparsable IP address, e.g. "a". This results in a possibility to authenticate/authorize to any account with known login or email address. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Since the default authentication flow uses a policy to enable the password stage only when there is no password stage selected on the Identification stage, this vulnerability can be used to skip this policy and continue without the password stage. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Am I affected |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This can be exploited for the following configurations: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - An attacker can access authentik without a reverse proxy (and `AUTHENTIK\_LISTEN\_\_TRUSTED\_PROXY\_CIDRS` is not configured properly) |
|  |  | - The reverse proxy configuration does not correctly overwrite X-Forwarded-For |
|  |  | - Policies (User and group bindings do \_not\_ apply) are bound to authentication/authorization flows |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Patches |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | authentik 2024.6.5 and 2024.8.3 fix this issue. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Workarounds |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Ensure the X-Forwarded-For header is always set by the reverse proxy, and is always set to a correct IP. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In addition you can manually change the \_Failure result\_ option on policy bindings to \_Pass\_, which will prevent any stages from being skipped if a malicious request is received. |
|  |  |  |
