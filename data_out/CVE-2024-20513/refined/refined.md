- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient entropy for handlers used during SSL VPN session establishment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Predictable session handlers, which can be brute-forced.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) for targeted users, termination of targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing users to reauthenticate.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Unauthenticated attacker: Brute-forcing valid session handlers.
  - Authenticated attacker: Connecting to the AnyConnect VPN to retrieve a valid session handler and predict further valid session handlers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the affected device's VPN service. Authenticated attackers need valid VPN credentials to establish an initial session.
