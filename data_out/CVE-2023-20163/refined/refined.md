- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker with administrator-level privileges can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user. Chaining further issues could lead to privilege escalation to root, gaining complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected Cisco ISE device and be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
