  Hello, I am on Fedora 30, I use keepass 2.41.

  I was reading journalctl with system logs when I suddenly see that keepass logs my passwords !

  I am very surprised and try to understand what happens, I think it could be an error log of keepass.

  I can give the message which is not so implicit :

  date linux.home keepass.desktop[2465]: mypassword

  It could also be related to copy clipboard error I do not know.

  If you have any idea, please let me know

  KeePass doesn't keep logs.

  This is still happening (runnin on Fedora 31). I just found out about it today when I was troubleshooting something else related to KeePass. I've been watching my logs, and it doesn't do it all the time, but pretty frequently. I think it might have something to do with mono? Usually the logs look something like this:

  keepass.desktop[2241]: mypasswordmypassword2anotherpassword

  systemd[1872]: gnome-launched-keepass.desktop-2241.scope: Succeeded.

  systemd[1872]: gnome-launched-keepass.desktop-2241.scope: Consumed 8min 15.555s CPU time.

  But I found one nearby that said (probably related to the problem I was trying to look into):

  keepass.desktop[2589]: mono: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :1.

  I noticed that when it does log my passwords, it will kind of do it in bulk. Sometimes several passwords on the same line, other times several lines with the same password. Most of the time it's just one password on one line though. Often it's immediately followed by an error message from some other application. Maybe it only happens if there's another logged event and the password is still in the buffer?

  Needless to say, this is concerning. I checked with a couple other friends who both also run KeePass on Fedora, and they are seeing it as well. Still trying to find a way to consistantly reproduce it.

  Do you know if the passwords were in the clipboard or typed?

  Mostly clipboard, I think. It's hard to know; I've not been able to find a consistant way to reproduce it, though it happens several times a day, from what I can see in my logs. One of my friends doesn't ever use the autotype feature, and it shows up in their logs. Also, from what I can see, it's almost always passwords for me, and rarely usernames (though they do show up from time to time), which also points to clipboard--if i'm copying and pasting, it means I'm likely logging through terminal through ssh and can't use autotype.

  New development (maybe). After doing a bunch of updates the other day, I've noticed a lot fewer instances of this in journalctl. After watching it all day yesturday, with no passwords getting logged, I was getting a little bit hopeful.

  Looking back this morning, though, I found that it basically logged every password I used yesturday in one single entry when I logged off. Maybe that's one way to reproduce it (by logging off or shutting down)? I'll have to keep an eye on it and see.

  Can you make the logging more verbose to try to catch the culprit?

  Hmmm... well, I was concerned about having my passwords exposed at this point, so I deleted all my user logs (the error only ends up in user.journal files, not system.journal).

  I've also started using KeePassXC for now, but I do have one last log entry from today when I closed KeePass. Here's the verbose output:

  Just in case it helps, this is the log imediately preceding the keepass one:

  I run syncthing, but my friends, who also see passwords, don't.

  I've fired up a Fedora machine and installed KeePass, but I can't see any KeePass info in the logs.

  How are you viewing the log?

  cheers, Paul
