#### #11793 Unretire rpms/keepass Closed: Fixed a year ago by kevin. Opened a year ago by tpokorra.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

Keepass was retired by the maintainer at the time because of a CVE issue that was not fixed upstream. This has been fixed by now. There are people in the Fedora Community that still need keepass, because they have issues with keepassxc.

* When do you need this?

It is not urgent.

* When is this no longer needed or useful?

It seems there is still a need for keepass.

* If we cannot complete your request, what is the impact?

Not a problem for me, but for some people it would be disappointing.

by the way, the EPEL branch was not retired. I have not been updating that though for a while.

As the package has been retired for more than 8 weeks, re-review is likely required:

What branches do you need unretired? Just rawhide/f40? Or others?

I would need rawhide, f39 and f38. The latter two does not seem to exist currently due to how long the package has been retired for.

Yeah, you will need to request new branches there, but I needed to know because they were still blocked in koji. ;)

ok, everything should be unretired now. Let me know if you have any issues with it.
