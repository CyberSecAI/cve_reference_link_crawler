  Hi,

  I just notice that my passwords are showing up in systemd journal after I copy them from keepass. I'm running fedora 27.

  keepass-2.36-3.fc27.x86\_64

  here is an example log entry (password redacted)

  keepass.desktop[11262]: <PASSWORD REDACTED="">XGetWindowProperty[\_NET\_ACTIVE\_WINDOW] failed (code=1)

  -HW

  Do you have xsel and xdotool installed? KeePass uses them if they exist.

  Try with and without them installed.

  I have both installed. They are both fedora keepass rpm dependancies. I wasn't able to remove them without breaking the keepass rpm dependancy chain. I've found that this problem is only happening when I'm using gnome3 on wayland. When i switch to gnome3 on X it doesn't happen.

  Seems like time for a bug report for wayland.

  Hello,

  I am facing the same problem: content of cut or paste actions are recorded in journalctl !!!

  example of recorded message:

  dec. 02 19:11:58 localhost.localdomain keepass.desktop[6230]: <clipboardcontent></clipboardcontent>

  This is done with delay :

  CtrC (clipboard is C1)

  CtrC (clipboard is C2)

  CtrC (clipboard is C3)

  -> Display of C1 in journal

  Ctrc (clipboard is C4)

  -> Display of C2 in journal

  I am running a fresh fedora 33.

  This is very scary, ie recording of all my user/password in clear in system journal when using them. A bug (very nasty one as keepass usage = leak of user/password through system logs.) ? a rootkit ?

  Can anybody reproduce such situation ?

  It's a Fedora thing and I've not seen a solution.

  Hello,

  This reproducible problem is then a clear keepass VULNERABILITY (even the source may be the fedora env) and keepass fedora users should be aware of it : I would suggest to initiate a CVE. Where to do that ?

    keepass does not manage you OS and its bad way of handling data. its NOT a keepass vulernabailty

    If you tell someone you password is neither a keepass vulnerability.

  How is this a KeePass vulnerability? Once something is copied to the clipboard, KeePass has no control over it. Copying passwords to the clipboard is a risk the user can chose to take or not take.

  There is already a warning at <https://keepass.info/help/kb/faq.html#clipovr> that says that other programs may record the contents of the clipboard.

  Hello,

  Don't you think that those two things are different ? :

  - using clipboard is at risk of malicious software accessing it

  - normal usage of keepass on fedora may leak credentials in clear in system journal.

  I do. The first one is a weakness, the second is a flaw.

  Fedora users must be aware of the problem. Other idea : what about having a paragraph in the security/security issues section of the keepass website ?

  I haven't noticed any other program (mail, office, browser, etc) for which using clipboard has a side effect of content being recorded in system journal. So even it is not directly done by keepass, could it has a relation with the way keepass relies on clipboard facility ?

  > could it has a relation with the way keepass relies on clipboard facility ?

  This is the reason. KeePass uses mono and workarounds for mono issues.

  If you are not happy with this situation you would be advised to use a native password manager, like KeeWeb or KeePassXC.

  Hello Paul,

  Who would be happy in using a password manager to increase its security and discovering by any chance that the solution leaks its credentials in clear in system logs ? The no warning information about this known problem as well as a perceived posture "not in my source code, not my problem" let me thinking that keepass has still not developed a full security conscience since the past 2016 disastrous initial position on its Man in the Middle flaw. That is a pity for such a good product, open source with great supporting community. Thanks for the tip, i am going to switch, sadly, to another password manager.

  No other program logs clipboard to the system log.

  Clipboard content is logged only when Keepass clears it. How is that an OS problem?

  Work around is to disable Keepass clipboard clearing in Fedora 35

  It does not occur in Windows, for which KeePass is written.
