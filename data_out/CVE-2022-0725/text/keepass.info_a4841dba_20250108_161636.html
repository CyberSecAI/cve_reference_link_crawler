Any software by other developers that is using the name "KeePass" in the software's name without any direct non-numeric/non-special prefix/suffix is abusing the name "KeePass" and we do not recommend such software. For example, "KeePassDroid" is ok, but "KeePass Droid" is not. |  | Contributed/Unofficial KeePass Packages | | | --- | --- | |  | [KeePass 2.x for Debian/Ubuntu Linux](https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/17d1bd26/)     [KeePass 2.x for Fedora Linux](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/keepass/keepass/)    [KeePass 2.x for OpenSUSE Linux](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Mono/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/src/)   [KeePass 2.x for Gentoo Linux](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/keepass)    [KeePass 2.x for Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/keepass/)    [KeePass 2.x for MacOS](download/p_macosx/index.html)   [KeePass 2.x for FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/security/keepass/)   [KeePass 2.x for Other Unix-like Systems](help/v2/setup.html#mono)   [KeePass 1.x for PortableApps.com Platform™](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/keepass_portable)    [KeePass 2.x for PortableApps.com Platform™](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/keepass-pro-portable)   [KeePass 1.x for U3 Devices](download/p_u3/)   [KeePass 2.x for U3 Devices](download/p_u3/)    [KeePass 1.x for Preinstalled Environments (PE)](http://xtremee.orgfree.com/Plugin_KeePass.html)       [KeePass 2.x for Turbo](https://hub.turbo.net/run/keepass/keepass) |  | Other Downloads and Resources | | | --- | --- | |  | Source code packages, containing everything you need to build your own `KeePass.exe` and plugins (source code, resources, build scripts, ...):  [KeePass 2.57.1 Source Code Package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/files/KeePass%202.x/2.57.1/KeePass-2.57.1-Source.zip/download)  [KeePass 1.42 Source Code Package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/files/KeePass%201.x/1.42/KeePass-1.42-Src.zip/download)   MSI packages (for network administrators only; regular users should use the installer or the ZIP package; the 2.x MSI requires Windows 7 or higher):  [KeePass 2.57.1 MSI Package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/files/KeePass%202.x/2.57.1/KeePass-2.57.1.msi/download)  [KeePass 1.42 MSI Package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/files/KeePass%201.x/1.42/KeePass-1.42.msi/download)    [Integrity: Hashes and OpenPGP Signatures](integrity.html), [.NET Public Keys](integrity_netpk.html)    [Downloads Archive (Old KeePass Releases, ...)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/files/)   [Alternative Download Sites](links.html#sites) | |  |
