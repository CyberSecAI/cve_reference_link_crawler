## Introduction

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of
the X selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

* #### To read a file into the X selection:

  xsel < file

  after which you can paste the file's contents into any X application
  with the middle mouse button, as though you had highlighted its text.
  xsel will read in the file contents exactly, whereas manual
  highlighting invariably breaks lines and transforms tabs into spaces.
  This is especially handy for copying in large files.

* #### To write the X selection to a file:

  xsel > file

  after which file will contain exactly the contents of the X
  selection, without trailing newlines and spaces and crap.

XSel is more than just cat for the X selection.

* #### Append to the X selection:

  xsel --append < file

* #### To follow a growing file:

  xsel --follow < file

  to make the X selection follow standard input as it grows (like
  tail -f).

## Advanced features

XSel also lets you access some of the more esoteric features of the X
selection:

* #### Delete the contents of the selection

  xsel --delete

  Will cause the program in which text is selected to delete that text. This
  really works, you can try it on xedit to remotely delete text in
  the editor window.

* #### Manipulate the secondary selection

  The X Window System maintains two selections, the usual *primary*
  selection and a *secondary*, which isn't used much ...
  XSel lets you use the secondary selection, for example:

  #### To get and set the secondary selection:

  xsel --secondary < file

  xsel --secondary > file

  #### To swap the primary and secondary selections:

  xsel --exchange

  So for example you can store useful text in the secondary selection and
  retrieve it later.

  * #### Manipulate the clipboard selection

    Similarly, X has a *clipboard* selection. You can use the standard
    xclipboard program to manage a history of selected text, and you
    can use xsel to actually get text into that clipboard:

    xsel --clipboard < file

  * #### Make the selection contents persist in memory

    Normally the X selection only exists as long as the program it was selected
    in is running. Further, some buggy applications tend to forget their selection
    text after a little while. If you run:

    xsel --keep

    after selecting some important text, xsel will copy the text into
    its own memory so you can paste it elsewhere even if the original program
    exits or crashes.

Naturally all these options have single character equivalents, and
xsel --help provides usage information.
For complete details, see the [xsel man page](xsel.1x.html).
