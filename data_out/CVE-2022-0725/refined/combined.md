I tried it on F35 with gnome (Xorg and wayland) and also Plasma (Xorg and wayland). Please clarify more detailed how to reproduce. Maybe clipit or something else is needed.  As this bug is the root cause to orphan keepass from fedora, I propose to get a detailed info on how to reproduce (and therefore find ways to fix). If this bug is not 100% reproducable, we should un-orphan the package.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c16)  Sandipan Roy    2022-07-27 17:43:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1899751](attachment.cgi?id=1899751) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1899751&action=edit) POC  Steps to Reproduce:  Step 1: Run "journalctl -f" in a terminal window.

If someone finds a solution, well lets go for it. Otherwise we should get rid of keepass and use <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/keepassxc> instead.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c20)  Dr. Tilmann Bubeck    2022-07-28 14:40:58 UTC  ``` Thanks for all the provided information.

From what I was able to gather so far, Kee extension does not support KeePassXC. While KeePassXC has its own Firefox extension, this is probably going to be problematic if the extensions are synchronised across OSes. It would be great if this problem could be fixed. Both discussions on sourceforge [1][2] refer to Fedora specifically which is interesting to say at least. I tried running with selinux set to permissive but it did not help. [1] <https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/33d6afdc/> [2] <https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/da7546b7e1/>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c22)  Robert Bartecki    2023-01-12 09:59:01 UTC  ``` KeePassXC is also missing the KeePass2 feature called "Synchronize with File" which is useful in case you use more than one computer and keep passwords in one file. With KeePassXC and other alternatives you can only overwrite your *.kbdx file with a newer one which sometimes may cause data loss. In KeePass2 you can synchronize just the entries which changed in both local file and a received file (eg. on usb stick). Basically you can add some entries on computer 1 and other entries on computer 2, than open KeePass2 and synchronize those two files - changes are merged.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c23)  Peter Oliver    2023-01-12 13:14:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to Robert Bartecki from [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c22)) > KeePassXC is also missing the KeePass2 feature called "Synchronize with > File"  KeePassXC calls this "Merge From Database...".   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c24)  Dominik Reichl    2023-05-21 10:47:51 UTC  ``` > The author of Keepass says it is written for Windows, and he does not care about Linux or Fedora.  That is not true. If you look into the changelogs of KeePass 2.x, you will notice that there frequently are improvements specific to Mono/Linux.  My position on [CVE-2022-0725](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0725) can be found here: <https://keepass.info/help/kb/sec_issues.html#fdslog>  Best regards, Dominik (KeePass author)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c25)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-21 10:52:42 UTC  ``` I believe I could still reproduce it on F37 and F38, I will retest. Did you test with the fedora package or with the prebuilt binary? The issue might be caused by the packaging.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c26)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-21 12:13:14 UTC  ``` I can reproduce it on Fedora 38, but only when starting keepass from the packaged icon. mono /usr/lib/keepass/KeePass.exe or keepass from command line leak no information to the journal. I tried changing the Exec entry in the desktop file to either of the above (from keepass %u) but neither did help. The original reproducer seems to be with KDE whereas I am testing with gnome so DE appears not to be the culprit. I am experiencing this on both X11 and Wayland so it is not that either.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c27)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-21 12:20:45 UTC  ``` @zbyszek, do you have any idea why this might be happening? If not, whom do you think we could ask?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c28)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2023-05-22 10:15:02 UTC  ``` I have never used KeePass or its variants, but very superficially, this bug seems to be about the text "Password" and the actual password ending up in the system log. I don't think they are written there on purpose, but instead something (KeePass?) writes them to stdout, and stdout is connected to the journal. According to [comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c26), this only happens when started "from the packaged icon", i.e. when the program is started as a background service. Recent versions of KDE and gnome start various services as systemd units under the user instance, and those units have stdout and stderr connected to the journal.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c29)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2023-05-22 10:19:32 UTC  ``` My guess would be that if the KeePass is started manually as in [comment #26](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c26), stdout/stderr are connected to a tty, and the program doesn't write output to tty. Maybe it'd be enough to start it as 'keepass &>/tmp/log', run the steps from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c16), and do 'cat /tmp/log'?   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c30)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-22 10:47:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek from [comment #29](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c29)) > My guess would be that if the KeePass is started manually as in [comment #26](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c26), > stdout/stderr > are connected to a tty, and the program doesn't write output to tty.

Password appears in /tmp/log if I do this. Dominik, can you reproduce?   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c31)  Dominik Reichl    2023-05-22 13:59:47 UTC  ``` No, I cannot reproduce it. I just tried the following:  1. Install Fedora 38 (in a VM with clipboard sharing disabled) and all updates (using the 'Software' app). 2. sudo dnf install mono-devel 3. Download 'KeePass-2.53.1.zip' from <https://keepass.info/download.html> and extract it. 4. Open a Terminal and run 'journalctl -f'. 5. Open another Terminal tab and run 'mono KeePass.exe &>/tmp/log'. 6. Create a new database. Copy the password of the first example entry (the password is 'Password') to the clipboard and wait until KeePass clears it automatically (12 seconds). Do the same for the second example entry (password '12345'). Wait again and then close KeePass.  When inspecting the journalctl output, the KeePass output (Terminal) and the '/tmp/log' file, I cannot find the passwords. The journalctl output mainly contains window manager warnings, the KeePass output (Terminal) nothing and the '/tmp/log' file only a 'Gtk not found...' message; nothing seems to be related to the clipboard.  If xsel is installed, KeePass calls it for clipboard operations (transferring the data via stdin/stdout of xsel), because on some systems, Mono's clipboard methods do not work properly. On a new Fedora 38 system, xsel is not installed, thus I then installed xsel (sudo dnf install xsel) and repeated the test above, but the result is the same, i.e. I cannot find the passwords in any of the 3 locations.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c32)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-22 14:30:19 UTC  ``` Thank you for checking. Fedora package requires xsel so I have it installed. I can also reproduce the problem with the keepass binary from sourceforge and /tmp/log, the passwords appear in the said file. I will check what happens if I remove it.  Do you also have xdotool installed? It is another requirement of the package: <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/keepass/blob/1425aa4b6f1e1f52bb9166aec3886498d57387de/f/keepass.spec#_30>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c33)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-22 15:31:56 UTC  ``` I have now tested with xsel and xdotool removed. It appears that the problem is caused by xdotool. Without it only the following appears in the log:  $ cat /tmp/log  Gtk-Message: 17:25:53.335: Failed to load module "pk-gtk-module"  with xdotool installed:  $ cat /tmp/log  Gtk-Message: 17:27:37.801: Failed to load module "pk-gtk-module" XGetWindowProperty[_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW] failed (code=1) xdo_get_active_window reported an error xxxpasswordxxXGetWindowProperty[_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW] failed (code=1) xdo_get_active_window reported an error   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c34)  Dominik Reichl    2023-05-22 15:49:00 UTC  ``` Interesting, thanks! With xdotool installed, I can reproduce the issue now.  It is unclear to me where exactly the passwords come from, but it seems to be triggered by one of the clipboard workarounds (which involves calling xsel, xdotool and xprop in the background). Can you confirm that the issue is gone (even with xsel and xdotool installed) when running KeePass with the command line parameter "-wa-disable:1530"?   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c35)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-22 15:58:56 UTC  ``` With -wa-disable:1530 the log contains no passwords:  $ cat /tmp/log  Could not set X locale modifiers Gtk-Message: 17:54:54.712: Failed to load module "pk-gtk-module"   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c36)  Dominik Reichl    2023-05-25 15:06:58 UTC  ``` The issue seems to be reproducible with xsel alone. Copy something to the clipboard and run 'xsel --clear --clipboard > /tmp/log'; the log file then contains the previous clipboard content. This doesn't happen on all systems; on Fedora 38 (GNOME/Wayland) it happens, but the log file is empty on Ubuntu 23.04 (GNOME/Wayland), Kubuntu 23.04 (KDE/X11), Mint 21 (Cinnamon/X11) and Manjaro 22 (GNOME/X11).  I've looked into the source code of xsel, but don't have any idea what could be causing this, sorry. The root of the issue could also be outside of xsel.  When testing xsel on the systems above, I also tested whether the clipboard workarounds in KeePass are still required. Fortunately, the methods of the Clipboard class (implemented by Mono) now work fine on the systems above. So, the workarounds probably aren't required anymore for most users.  Therefore, the clipboard workarounds will be disabled by default in the next KeePass version (2.54, probably released in about 1-2 weeks). This avoids the CVE issue for KeePass.  Here's the latest development snapshot, if you want to test it: <https://keepass.info/filepool/KeePass_230525.zip>  If there are a few users who still need the clipboard workarounds, they can enable them explicitly with the command line parameter '-wa-enable:1530,1613'. In this case, the user should of course check whether the clipboard content is logged.  Thanks for your help!   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c37)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-25 15:22:59 UTC  ``` I am CCing xsel maintainer, maybe he can help.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c38)  Dr. Tilmann Bubeck    2023-05-25 17:41:50 UTC  ``` From the man page and source code of xsel you can see, that this is specified behaviour:         By default, this program outputs the selection without modification  if        both  standard  input  and standard output are terminals (ttys). Other‐        wise, the current selection is output if standard output is not a  ter‐        minal  (tty),  and the selection is set from standard input if standard        input is not a terminal (tty). If any input or output options are given        then the program behaves only in the requested mode.  This means, that if stdout is not a tty, then --output is assumed and therefore clipboard is printed before doing --clear. You can see this in the source code of xsel.c    /* Specify default behaviour based on input and output file types */   if (isatty(0) && isatty(1)) {     /* Interactive mode: both stdin and stdout are ttys */     do_input = False; dont_input = True;     do_output = False; dont_output = False;   } else if (!isatty(0) && !isatty(1)) {     /* Scripted: both stdin and stdout are NOT ttys */     do_input = False; dont_input = True;     do_output = True; dont_output = False;   } else {     /* Interactive, pipelined: one of stdin or stdout is a tty */     do_input = !isatty(0); dont_input = !do_input;     do_output = !isatty(1); dont_output = !do_output;   }  ....    /* handle output modes */   if (do_output || !dont_output) {     /* Get the current selection */     old_sel = get_selection_text (selection);     if (old_sel) printf ("%s", old_sel);   }   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c39)  Dr. Tilmann Bubeck    2023-05-26 06:02:26 UTC  ``` According to <https://vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/> it seems, that xsel has moved to <https://github.com/kfish/xsel>. There is already a xsel-1.2.1 available, which seems to have fixed that bug. The bug is, that "--clear" still does a "--output" because it stumbles over its handling with do_output and dont_output. So also updating xsel to 1.2.1 will fix this bug here.   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c40)  Dominik Reichl    2023-05-26 13:57:25 UTC  ``` I see; thanks!   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c41)  Julian Sikorski    2023-05-27 12:36:33 UTC  ``` Regarding as to why only Fedora appears to be affected: at least Ubuntu appears to ship 9bfc13d git snapshot from 2018. My educated guess is that the commit fixing the output logic is this one from 2010: <https://github.com/kfish/xsel/commit/79748acf3045546a4d8ae444de99bb7a07d16eb7> Fedora, on the other hand, ships 1.2.0 with only a handful of patches: <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/xsel/tree/rawhide> It still does not explain why on my machine both xsel and xdotool were needed to reproduce the problem. In any case, it appears that xsel is the culprit.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c42)  Julian Sikorski    2023-06-04 09:12:54 UTC  ``` I can confirm that with 2.54 the issue is gone without having to disable any workarounds manually.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c43)  Dominik Reichl    2023-06-05 10:44:56 UTC  ``` Great; thanks for testing it!   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c45)  Robert Bartecki    2023-11-19 17:38:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Peter Oliver from [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c23)) > (In reply to Robert Bartecki from [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=2052696#c22)) > > KeePassXC is also missing the KeePass2 feature called "Synchronize with > > File" >  > KeePassXC calls this "Merge From Database...".

# Package Review Process

In order for a new package to be added to Fedora,
the package must first undertake a formal review.
The process is governed by the FESCo approved [Package Review Policy](../../fesco/Package_review_policy/).

## Review Process

There are two roles in the review process,
that of the contributor and that of the reviewer.
This document presents both perspectives.

### Exemptions

Certain packages are exempted from the review process
as described in the [Applicability section of Package Review Policy](../../fesco/Package_review_policy/#what).
If an exemption is warranted,
the contributor can directly request a repository for the package.
The request to create a repo should include the `--exception` flag
instead of a bug number:

```
fedpkg request-repo --exception <package-name>
```

### Contributor

A Contributor is defined as someone who wants to submit
(and maintain)
a new package in Fedora.
To become a contributor,
you must follow the detailed instructions to [Joining the Package Maintainers](../Joining_the_Package_Maintainers/).

As a Contributor, you should have already made a package
which adheres to the [Packaging Guidelines](../../packaging-guidelines/)
and does not contain any [Forbidden Items](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items).

When you’re happy with your spec file,
you should then submit that SRPM to a package review.
Currently, this is done by following these steps:

* Put your spec file and SRPM somewhere on the Internet
  where it can be directly downloaded
  (just http(s), no registration pages or special download methods, please).
  If you have no place to put your spec and SRPM,
  use [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/).
* Fill out a [request for review in bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&format=fedora-review).
  Make absolutely certain to file this bug
  with an account tied to your FAS email address,
  otherwise your followup requests will be closed as invalid.

|  | If nobody comments on your review request, you might want to mail to a mailing list (for example, devel) or the [Package Review Swaps category](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/workflows/pkg-review-swap/91) on Fedora Discussion to ask for a "review swap". This is an offer to do a review of someone else’s package in exchange for them reviewing your package. This is usually one-for-one, or can be some other private arrangement depending on the difficulty of the respective packages. |
| --- | --- |

* If you are not member of the [packager](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/packager/) group, you need a sponsor.
  Add [FE-NEEDSPONSOR](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=FE-NEEDSPONSOR) to the bugs being blocked by your review request.
  For more information read [How to Get Sponsored into the Packager Group](../How_to_Get_Sponsored_into_the_Packager_Group/).
* If this is a "re-review" request needed to [claim ownership](../Package_Retirement_Process/#claiming)
  of a retired package, add `Unretirement` to the *Whiteboard* field.
* Wait for someone to review your package!
  At this point in the process, the `fedora-review` flag is blank,
  meaning that no reviewer is assigned.
* There may be comments from people that are not formally reviewing the package,
  they may add `NotReady` to the *Whiteboard* field,
  indication that the review request is not yet ready,
  because of some issues they report.
  After you have addressed them,
  please post the URLs to the updated SPEC and SRPM file
  and clear the Whiteboard.
  It is expected that you will respond to commentary,
  including updating your submission to address it;
  if you do not, your ticket will be closed.
* A reviewer takes on the task of reviewing your package.
  They will set the `fedora-review` flag to `?`.
* The reviewer will review your package.
  You should fix any blockers that the reviewer identifies.
  Once the reviewer is happy with the package,
  the `fedora-review` flag will be set to `+`,
  indicating that the package has passed review.
* If you have not yet been sponsored,
  request sponsorship by [raising an issue at packager-sponsors](https://pagure.io/packager-sponsors/issues).
* When your package passes the review
  you should use `fedpkg` to request a Git repository for it.
  Before you can request a Git repository for the package,
  you will need a [pagure.io api token](https://pagure.io/settings/token/new)
  with *Create a new ticket* ACL
  added into `~/.config/rpkg/fedpkg.conf`:

  ```
  [fedpkg.pagure]
  token = <generated-code>
  ```
* Request a Git repository for the package.
  For example, if the package name is `my-package`
  and the bugzilla review ticket is 12345,
  :

  ```
  fedpkg request-repo my-package 12345
  ```

  Check that your review bug is valid.
  It must have the `fedora-review` set to `+`,
  and it must be assigned to your reviewer.
  Otherwise your repository request will be closed as invalid.
* If you want to add your package to more Fedora releases
  and not just Rawhide,
  see [Requesting branches](../Package_Maintenance_Guide/#requesting_branches).
* When [fedora-scm-requests tickets](https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-scm-requests/issues)
  for the requested repository and branches are closed,
  checkout the package:

  ```
  fedpkg clone
  ```
* Now you can [import your SRPM package](../New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/#import_commit_and_build_your_package).
  Do a final check of spec file tags, etc.
* Request a Koji build by running `fedpkg build`.
  (You will need to set up [Kerberos for Fedora project](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Kerberos))
* Repeat the process for other branches you may have requested above:

  + Checkout given branch: `fedpkg switch-branch f40`
  + Let Koji build the package for this branch: `fedpkg build`
* Request updates for Fedora release branches, if necessary,
  using `fedpkg update`
  or another Bodhi interface as detailed in [Bodhi](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi).
* If possible, add your package to [Upstream Release Monitoring](../Upstream_Release_Monitoring/).
* To be notified if your package stops building successfully
  when dependencies are updated in Fedora,
  you can enable [Koschei](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koschei).
* You should make sure the review ticket is closed.
  You are welcome to close it
  once the package has been built on the requested branches.
  If you built for one of the Fedora release branches
  you can ask Bodhi to close the ticket for you
  when it completes the process.
  If you close the ticket yourself, use `NEXTRELEASE` as the resolution.

You do not need to go through the review process again
for subsequent package changes,
and should not reference the review ticket in subsequent updates
you create in Bodhi.

### Reviewer

The Reviewer is the person who chooses to review a package.

The Reviewer can be any Fedora account holder
who is a member of the [packager group](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/packager/).
(If the Contributor is not yet sponsored,
the review can still proceed to completion
but they will need to find a sponsor at some point.)

* Search [Package Review Tracker](https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/) for a review request
  that needs a reviewer: `fedora-review` flag is blank or the bug is assigned to `nobody@fedoraproject.org`.
* If you notice some issues that need to be solved
  before you want to start a formal review,
  add these issues in a comment
  and set the *Whiteboard* of the bug to contain `NotReady`.
  This helps other possible reviewers
  to notice that the review request is not yet ready for further review action.
* If you want to formally review the package,
  set the `fedora-review` flag to `?`
  and assign the bug to yourself.
* Review the package

  + Go through the MUST items listed in [Review Guidelines](../../packaging-guidelines/ReviewGuidelines/) .
  + Go through the SHOULD items in [Review Guidelines](../../packaging-guidelines/ReviewGuidelines/) .
  + The [FedoraReview](https://pagure.io/FedoraReview) tool
    (packaged as `fedora-review`)
    can help to automate this process.
* Include the text of your review in a comment in the ticket.
  For easy readability, simply use a regular comment
  instead of an attachment.
* Take one of the following actions:

  + **ACCEPT** - If the package is good, set the `fedora-review` flag to `+`.
    Do not close the review ticket yet - this will be done by the submitter
    once the package becomes available in Fedora.
  + **FAIL, LEGAL** - If the package is legally risky for whatever reason
    (known patent or copyright infringement, trademark concerns)
    close the bug as `WONTFIX`
    and leave an appropriate comment
    (i.e. *we don’t ship mp3, so stop submitting it*).
    Set the `fedora-review` flag to `-`,
    and have the review ticket block [FE-Legal](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=FE-Legal).
  + **FAIL, OTHER** - If the package is just way off
    or unsuitable for some other reason,
    and there is no simple fix,
    then close the bug as `WONTFIX`
    and leave an appropriate comment
    (i.e. *we don’t package pornography for redistribution, sorry.*
    Or, *this isn’t a specfile, it’s a McDonald’s menu, sorry.*)
    Set the `fedora-review` flag to `-`.
  + **NEEDSWORK** - Anything that isn’t explicitly failed should be left open
    while the submitter and reviewer work together to fix any potential issues.
    Mark the bug as `NEEDINFO`
    while waiting for the reviewer to respond to improvement requests.
    This makes it easier for reviewers to find open reviews
    which require their input.
* Once a package is flagged as `fedora-review +` (or `-`),
  the Reviewer’s job is done
  although they may be called upon to assist the Contributor
  with the import/build/update process
  and to ensure that the Contributor closes the ticket
  when the process is complete.

## Definitions for fedora-review flag Settings

| fedora-review | (BLANK) | Package Needs Review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fedora-review | ? | Package Under Review |
| fedora-review | - | Package Failed Review, dropped for legal or other issues. |
| fedora-review | + | Package Approved |

## Special blocker tickets

There are a few tickets which can be placed in the "Blocks" field
to indicate specific ticket statuses:

| FE-NEEDSPONSOR | The submitter requires a sponsor; the review can be done by anyone, but a sponsor will need to come and sponsor the submitter. |
| --- | --- |
| FE-DEADREVIEW | The review has been closed out because the submitter has left; users looking for packages to submit may find some possibilities in these dead tickets. |
| FE-Legal | The package is currently awaiting review by the legal team. |

## The Whiteboard

To save time for reviewers,
the [New, reviewable Fedora package review tickets](https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/reviewable.html) page
will hide certain tickets which are not reviewable.
The *Whiteboard* field can be used
to mark a ticket with various additional bits of status
which will cause it to be hidden
or displayed differently.

| NotReady | The package is not yet ready for review. It is possible to open a review ticket, mark it as NotReady, and continue to work on it until it’s ready to be seen by a reviewer. |
| --- | --- |
| BuildFails | The package fails to build. |
| AwaitingSubmitter | The package review is stalled and cannot proceed without input from the submitter. |
| Trivial | The package is trivial to review. See below. |
| Unretirement | A re-review needed to [claim ownership](../Package_Retirement_Process/#claiming) of a retired package . |

The `Trivial` status is intended to indicate packages which,
as an aid to new reviewers,
are especially uncomplicated and easy to review.
A ticket should not be marked as being trivial unless:

* The package is known to build
  and a link to a scratch build is included.
* The ticket explains any rpmlint output which is present.
* The spec contains nothing which is unnecessary in modern Fedora
  (such as `BuildRoot:`, a `%clean` section or `%defattr`).
* The spec is free from excessive or complicated macro usage.
* The spec uses only the least complicated scriptlets
  which are taken directly from the [Scriptlets](../../packaging-guidelines/Scriptlets/) page.
* The package contains no daemons.
* The package is not especially security sensitive.
* The code has undergone a thorough inspection for licensing issues.
  Anomalies which would be found by `licensecheck` should be explained.

In short, this should be reserved only for those tickets
which should be easily approachable
by someone doing their first package review.

## Tracking of Package Requests

The [Package Review Tracker](https://fedoraproject.org/PackageReviewStatus/) provides various review-related reports
and a simple way to search for reviews
by package name or reporter name or others.

#### #11793 Unretire rpms/keepass Closed: Fixed a year ago by kevin. Opened a year ago by tpokorra.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

Keepass was retired by the maintainer at the time because of a CVE issue that was not fixed upstream. This has been fixed by now. There are people in the Fedora Community that still need keepass, because they have issues with keepassxc.

* When do you need this?

It is not urgent.

* When is this no longer needed or useful?

It seems there is still a need for keepass.

* If we cannot complete your request, what is the impact?

Not a problem for me, but for some people it would be disappointing.

As the package has been retired for more than 8 weeks, re-review is likely required:

I would need rawhide, f39 and f38. The latter two does not seem to exist currently due to how long the package has been retired for.

Yeah, you will need to request new branches there, but I needed to know because they were still blocked in koji. ;)

ok, everything should be unretired now. Let me know if you have any issues with it.

Patch by Taylan Ulrich B.

The man page states "If any input or output options are given then the
program behaves only in the requested mode.", but this doesn't seem to
be true.

The following will put out "bar", then change the primary selection to "foo".

echo foo | { echo bar | xsel -pi; xsel -po; }

The above example doesn't really make sense since the output of 'echo
foo' is not otherwise used. However, the following fails too:

echo foo | { echo "$(cat) bar" | xsel -pi; xsel -po; }

That one is a typical example of modifying data in a pipe before
passing it on to xsel -i, and then showing the result with an extra
xsel -o. The 'xsel -po' would surely not be expected to affect the
primary selection, but it does; it seems to read from stdin, which is
empty because it has been used up by cat, and put it into the primary
selection, effectively clearing it out.
(You might say "Put the 'xsel -po' outside the '{...}'.", but that
part could as well be a shell function or script, over which we'd have
no control.)

    { 'initial_values'  => {},
      'mdf'             => '/u/mdf/mdf-kospi200-woori2.20100910-10199.pcap',
      'branch'          => 'dev'
    },
```

Gasti and K. B. Rasmussen have presented attacks on the KDB and KDBX file formats based on unauthenticated header data. For KDB, this issue has allowed silent data removal attacks. For KDBX, the issue has allowed silent data corruption attacks. Both were minor security issues (confidentiality was not compromised).  **Status.** Header data authentication has been introduced for both KDB and KDBX in KeePass [1.24](../../news/n120901_1.24.html) and [2.20](../../news/n120908_2.20.html), in order to prevent the attacks. See also the release notes '[KeePass 1.24 and 2.20 Header Authentication](db_headerauth_upg.html)'. P. Gasti and K. B. Rasmussen published their paper in a responsible disclosure process, and the defenses in KeePass have been implemented before the issues were presented to the public.  `MemUtil.ArraysEqual` Susceptible to Timing Attack **Problem.** It has been reported that the method `MemUtil.ArraysEqual` is susceptible to a timing side-channel attack.  **Analysis.** The time required by `MemUtil.ArraysEqual` indeed depends on the data, but it is irrelevant. In a timing side-channel attack, an attacker analyzes the time that a cryptographic system requires to perform some operation and tries to deduce secret information from it. For KeePass, this is not applicable. KeePass is a desktop application and does not feature any server capabilities (especially, no automatic database opening can be triggered externally). If there is spyware on the PC that KeePass is running on, there are far more easy and efficient attacks for the spyware to steal passwords from KeePass than a timing side-channel attack (see also the section '[Specialized Spyware](../base/security.html#secspecattacks)' on the security page).  KeeFarce KeeFarce is *not* an attack (and the developer of the tool also nowhere declares it as attack or threat).  KeeFarce extracts information of a running KeePass process (with an open database) using a rather complicated method (using DLL injection). There are much simpler ways to achieve that. For example, a tool could send simulated keypresses to the KeePass window to export the data to a file (e.g. press `Alt+F`, `E`, `Tab`, `Space`, ...). Before that, a screenshot could be created and displayed above all windows in order to hide this procedure (and a user probably would not notice a screen freeze of one second). Alternatively, imagine a tool that captures your master password (keylogger) and your database file.  The actual problem here is running specialized spyware (as the same user and with the same rights, like KeeFarce assumes). If you are doing this, everything is over. An application cannot protect itself in such a case; all modern PC operating systems (Windows, Linux, ...) intentionally allow applications to manipulate other applications on the same level. See also the section '[Specialized Spyware](../base/security.html#secspecattacks)' on the security page.  Protections against generic (non-specialized) spyware can sometimes be implemented. For example, [Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation (TCATO)](../v2/autotype_obfuscation.html) is a way to protect auto-typed data from keyloggers, the [secure desktop](sec_desk.html) protects your master password from some keyloggers, [secure edit controls](../base/secedits.html) protect against password control spies, and so on. These protections only work against specific classes of generic spyware. For example, while TCATO protects against keyloggers, a spyware that is both a keylogger and a clipboard spy at the same time renders TCATO useless. Again, the actual problem is running spyware, not any insufficient protections. There is no protection against a spyware monitoring everything and allowed to do everything, except not running the spyware in the first place. Protections like TCATO might save you in the case of running some non-advanced spyware, but they are not a license for running any arbitrary spyware.  Neither KeePass nor any other password manager can magically run securely in a spyware-infected, insecure environment. Users still are responsible for the security of their PC. Do use anti-virus software, keep security-critical software up-to-date, use a proper firewall, only run software from trusted sources, do not open unknown e-mail attachments, etc.  Automatic Update Vulnerability There have been some articles about automatic KeePass updates being vulnerable. This section clarifies the situation and its resolution.  First of all, we would like to note that KeePass cannot update itself. KeePass does support checking for updates (optional; by downloading a version information file, comparing the available with the installed version number, and displaying a notification if necessary). However, it neither downloads nor installs any new version automatically. Users have to do this manually.  KeePass can be downloaded from many servers (SourceForge with its many mirror servers, FossHub, etc.).  All KeePass files containing executable code (files with the extension 'exe' or 'dll') are digitally signed using Authenticode. Instructions how to verify the digital signatures can be found in the FAQ: '[How to verify the digital signatures?](faq.html#sig)'.  The KeePass website links to SourceForge for downloading KeePass. However, even if SourceForge (or the KeePass website) is compromised and serves a malicious download, users who check the digital signature will notice the attack and will not run the malware. *Note that HTTPS cannot prevent an attack via a compromise of the download server; checking the digital signature does.*  The version information file was downloaded from the KeePass website over HTTP. Thus, a man in the middle (someone who can intercept your connection to the KeePass website) could have returned an incorrect version information file, possibly making KeePass display a notification that a new KeePass version is available. However, the next steps (downloading and installing the new version) must be carried out by the user manually, and here users who check the digital signature will notice the attack.  **Resolution.** In order to prevent a man in the middle from making KeePass display incorrect version information (even though this does not imply a successful attack, see above), the version information file is now digitally signed (using RSA-4096 and SHA-512). KeePass 2.34 and higher only accept such a digitally signed version information file. Furthermore, the version information file is now downloaded over HTTPS.  Write Access to Configuration File An attacker who has write access to the KeePass [configuration](../base/configuration.html) file can modify it maliciously. This is not really a security vulnerability of KeePass though.   * If the user has installed KeePass using the setup program, the   configuration file is stored in the user's application data directory   (in "%APPDATA%\KeePass"), which is within the user profile   directory ("%USERPROFILE%").   In this case, having write access to the KeePass configuration file is   typically equivalent to having write access to the user profile directory.   Someone who has write access to the user profile directory can   perform various kinds of attacks.   For example, the attacker could add malware in the startup folder   ("%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup";   the malware will run automatically after the next user logon),   modify desktop shortcuts (in "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop"),   manipulate the user's registry (file "%USERPROFILE%\NTUSER.DAT"),   modify configuration files of other applications   (for instance to make a browser open a malicious website automatically),   and so on. * If the user is using the portable version of KeePass,   the configuration file is stored in the application directory   (which contains the "KeePass.exe" file).   In this case, having write access to the KeePass configuration file is   typically equivalent to having write access to the application directory.   With this capability, an attacker can for instance simply replace the   "KeePass.exe" file by some malware.   In both cases, having write access to the KeePass configuration file typically implies that an attacker can actually perform much more powerful attacks than modifying the configuration file (and these attacks in the end can also affect KeePass, independent of a configuration file protection).  These attacks can only be prevented by keeping the environment secure (by using an anti-virus software, a firewall, not opening unknown e-mail attachments, etc.). KeePass cannot magically run securely in an insecure environment.  See also: [Specialized Spyware](../base/security.html#secspecattacks) and [Enforced Configuration](config_enf.html).  Exporting CSV Files With Application-Specific Expressions When exporting data to a CSV file, KeePass encodes certain characters (as required by the file format), but it does not filter any expressions supported by some other applications (not defined by the generic CSV file format). This may result in a certain behavior in such an application.  For example, when opening an exported CSV file in a spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc), this application may interpret/evaluate some data as formulas.  We think that this is not a problem in KeePass, but in the application that interprets/evaluates the application-specific expressions (which should ask the user whether/how to interpret the CSV file).  For a detailed explanation, see  '[CSV formula injection](https://bughunters.google.com/learn/invalid-reports/google-products/4965108570390528/csv-formula-injection)' on the Google Bug Hunters website.  Auto-Type Window/Sequence Matching The [auto-type](../base/autotype.html) feature simulates keypresses into another application, usually to perform a login. A keystroke sequence is associated with a target window via the title of the target window (for details, see the auto-type help page).  An advantage of this approach is that auto-type is compatible with almost all applications/windows; almost every window has a title. A disadvantage is that window titles are not unique. For example, a malicious website can use the same title as a legitimate website (which typically results in the browser window titles being the same).  Thus, the user is responsible for ensuring that the target window is legitimate. With regard to association, auto-type's security is the same as the security of the clipboard and drag&drop:   * When copying data to the clipboard, the user is responsible for pasting   the data only into a legitimate target window. * When dragging data, the user is responsible for dropping   the data only into a legitimate target window. * When auto-typing a keystroke sequence, the user is responsible for   ensuring that the target window is legitimate.   There of course are other data transfer methods (see the [plugins](../../plugins.html) page) that support a stronger association than via the target window title (and thus are more resistant against phishing). However, these either do not have anything to do with auto-type ([KeeForm](../../plugins.html#formfiller), [Kee](../../plugins.html#kee), etc.) or work only with specific applications ([WebAutoType](../../plugins.html#webautotype), [URL in Title Bar](../../plugins.html#urlintitle), etc.). The compatibility with basically all applications/windows is a design goal of auto-type.  We do not think that the clipboard, drag&drop and auto-type are security issues. Users who worry about transferring data to a malicious application/window can use one of the other data transfer methods.  .NET Framework Version For compatibility with as many systems as reasonably possible, KeePass is built in such a way that it runs with the .NET Framework 2.0 or higher. Nowadays, the .NET Framework 2.0 is outdated and not maintained anymore; it may have security vulnerabilities. However, the compatibility of KeePass with the .NET Framework 2.0 does *not* mean that KeePass inherits the security vulnerabilities of the .NET Framework 2.0 when running on a higher version.  KeePass is built/configured in such a way that it runs with the highest version of the .NET Frameworks installed on the PC. For example, if you have installed the .NET Frameworks 3.5 and 4.8 (both, in parallel) and start KeePass, then it runs with the .NET Framework 4.8.  Microsoft fully [supports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework) the latest version of the .NET Framework and keeps it up-to-date automatically via Windows Update.  Related: '[Is there a 64-bit version?](faq.html#x64)'.  Sensitive Data in Fedora System Log (CVE-2022-0725) On Fedora systems (other Linux systems do not seem to be affected), copying data to the clipboard may have resulted in the data to appear in the system log ('systemd' journal). This issue has been reported as CVE-2022-0725.  KeePass itself does not (and never did) write any sensitive data to a system log. The issue must have been caused by an external component (tool, framework or operating system component). CVE-2022-0725 incorrectly claims that it would be caused by a flaw in KeePass.  In order to avoid the issue, KeePass ≥ 2.54 uses a different method for copying data to the clipboard. | [Get KeePass](https://keepass.info/) |

  Hello, I am on Fedora 30, I use keepass 2.41.

  I was reading journalctl with system logs when I suddenly see that keepass logs my passwords !

  I am very surprised and try to understand what happens, I think it could be an error log of keepass.

  I can give the message which is not so implicit :

  date linux.home keepass.desktop[2465]: mypassword

  It could also be related to copy clipboard error I do not know.

  If you have any idea, please let me know

  KeePass doesn't keep logs.

  This is still happening (runnin on Fedora 31). I just found out about it today when I was troubleshooting something else related to KeePass. I've been watching my logs, and it doesn't do it all the time, but pretty frequently. I think it might have something to do with mono? Usually the logs look something like this:

  keepass.desktop[2241]: mypasswordmypassword2anotherpassword

  systemd[1872]: gnome-launched-keepass.desktop-2241.scope: Succeeded.

  systemd[1872]: gnome-launched-keepass.desktop-2241.scope: Consumed 8min 15.555s CPU time.

  But I found one nearby that said (probably related to the problem I was trying to look into):

  keepass.desktop[2589]: mono: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :1.

  I noticed that when it does log my passwords, it will kind of do it in bulk. Sometimes several passwords on the same line, other times several lines with the same password. Most of the time it's just one password on one line though. Often it's immediately followed by an error message from some other application. Maybe it only happens if there's another logged event and the password is still in the buffer?

  Needless to say, this is concerning. I checked with a couple other friends who both also run KeePass on Fedora, and they are seeing it as well. Still trying to find a way to consistantly reproduce it.

  Do you know if the passwords were in the clipboard or typed?

  Mostly clipboard, I think. It's hard to know; I've not been able to find a consistant way to reproduce it, though it happens several times a day, from what I can see in my logs. One of my friends doesn't ever use the autotype feature, and it shows up in their logs. Also, from what I can see, it's almost always passwords for me, and rarely usernames (though they do show up from time to time), which also points to clipboard--if i'm copying and pasting, it means I'm likely logging through terminal through ssh and can't use autotype.

  New development (maybe). After doing a bunch of updates the other day, I've noticed a lot fewer instances of this in journalctl. After watching it all day yesturday, with no passwords getting logged, I was getting a little bit hopeful.

  Looking back this morning, though, I found that it basically logged every password I used yesturday in one single entry when I logged off. Maybe that's one way to reproduce it (by logging off or shutting down)? I'll have to keep an eye on it and see.

  Can you make the logging more verbose to try to catch the culprit?

  Hmmm... well, I was concerned about having my passwords exposed at this point, so I deleted all my user logs (the error only ends up in user.journal files, not system.journal).

  I've also started using KeePassXC for now, but I do have one last log entry from today when I closed KeePass. Here's the verbose output:

  Just in case it helps, this is the log imediately preceding the keepass one:

  I run syncthing, but my friends, who also see passwords, don't.

  I've fired up a Fedora machine and installed KeePass, but I can't see any KeePass info in the logs.

  How are you viewing the log?

XSel -- manipulate the X selection.

Copyright (C) 2001 Conrad Parker <conrad@vergenet.net>

For updates see <http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/>

INTRODUCTION
============

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the
X selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

To read a file into the X selection:
------------------------------------

        xsel < file

after which you can paste the file's contents into any X application with
the middle mouse button, as though you had highlighted its text. XSel will
read in the file contents exactly, whereas manual highlighting invariably
breaks lines and transforms tabs into spaces. This is especially handy for
copying in large files.

To write the X selection to a file:
-----------------------------------

        xsel > file

after which file will contain exactly the contents of the X selection,
without trailing newlines and spaces and crap.

XSel is more than just cat for the X selection.

Append to the X selection:
--------------------------

        xsel --append < file

To follow a growing file:
-------------------------

        xsel --follow < file

to make the X selection follow standard input as it grows (like tail -f).

ADVANCED FEATURES
=================

XSel also lets you access some of the more esoteric features of the
X selection:

Delete the contents of the selection
------------------------------------

        xsel --delete

Will cause the program in which text is selected to delete that text. This
really works, you can try it on xedit to remotely delete text in the editor
window.

Manipulate the secondary selection
----------------------------------

The X Window System maintains two selections, the usual primary selection
and a secondary, which isn't used much ... XSel lets you use the secondary
selection, for example:

        To get and set the secondary selection:
        ---------------------------------------

        xsel --secondary < file
        xsel --secondary > file

        To swap the primary and secondary selections:
        ---------------------------------------------
        xsel --exchange

So for example you can store useful text in the secondary selection and
retrieve it later.

Manipulate the clipboard selection
----------------------------------

Similarly, X has a clipboard selection. You can use the standard xclipboard
program to manage a history of selected text, and you can use xsel to
actually get text into that clipboard:

        xsel --clipboard < file

Make the selection contents persist in memory
---------------------------------------------

Normally the X selection only exists as long as the program it was selected
in is running. Further, some buggy applications tend to forget their
selection text after a little while. If you run:

        xsel --keep

after selecting some important text, xsel will copy the text into its own
memory so you can paste it elsewhere even if the original program exits or crashes.

Further information
===================

Naturally all these options have single character equivalents, and

        xsel --help

provides usage information. For complete details, see the xsel(1x) man page.

DOWNLOAD
========

New versions of XSel are distributed in source form from:

        <http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/>

STANDARDS
=========

X11 ICCCM2
----------

XSel conforms to the X Window System Inter-Client Communication Conventions
Manual Version 2.0 (ICCCM2), including correct handling of TARGETS,
MULTIPLE, TIMESTAMP, and DELETE targets, INCR properties and large data
transfers.

My thoughts on ICCCM are available at:

%description
KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to
remember your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in
one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file.  You
only have to remember one single master password or select the key file
to unlock the whole database.

# Locally Syncing Open KeePassXC Database Between Two Computers

I have a KeePassXC database that I would like to keep synchronized between two computers. I'm aware that there are solutions involving the cloud (Drive, Dropbox, etc.), but putting my password database on the cloud makes me nervous, even if it is encrypted.

I've been exploring some local syncing options. However, since I often keep my database open on both computers (since I'm frequently switching back and forth between them), it would be ideal for me to make changes on one computer and have that change *immediately* propagate to the open database on the other computer (such that, say, somebody looking at my open database on the other computer would see an entry spontaneously appear, disappear, or change).

Does such a solution exist? If not, what solution would you recommend that offers the best balance of safety and convenience?

Thanks to the community for all of their help!

  Hi,

  I just notice that my passwords are showing up in systemd journal after I copy them from keepass. I'm running fedora 27.

  keepass-2.36-3.fc27.x86\_64

  here is an example log entry (password redacted)

  keepass.desktop[11262]: <PASSWORD REDACTED="">XGetWindowProperty[\_NET\_ACTIVE\_WINDOW] failed (code=1)

  Do you have xsel and xdotool installed? KeePass uses them if they exist.

  Try with and without them installed.

  I have both installed. They are both fedora keepass rpm dependancies. I wasn't able to remove them without breaking the keepass rpm dependancy chain. I've found that this problem is only happening when I'm using gnome3 on wayland. When i switch to gnome3 on X it doesn't happen.

  Hello,

  I am facing the same problem: content of cut or paste actions are recorded in journalctl !!!

  example of recorded message:

  dec. 02 19:11:58 localhost.localdomain keepass.desktop[6230]: <clipboardcontent></clipboardcontent>

  This is done with delay :

  CtrC (clipboard is C1)

  CtrC (clipboard is C2)

  CtrC (clipboard is C3)

  -> Display of C1 in journal

  Ctrc (clipboard is C4)

  -> Display of C2 in journal

  I am running a fresh fedora 33.

  This is very scary, ie recording of all my user/password in clear in system journal when using them. A bug (very nasty one as keepass usage = leak of user/password through system logs.) ? a rootkit ?

  Can anybody reproduce such situation ?

  Hello,

  This reproducible problem is then a clear keepass VULNERABILITY (even the source may be the fedora env) and keepass fedora users should be aware of it : I would suggest to initiate a CVE. Where to do that ?

    keepass does not manage you OS and its bad way of handling data. its NOT a keepass vulernabailty

    If you tell someone you password is neither a keepass vulnerability.

  How is this a KeePass vulnerability? Once something is copied to the clipboard, KeePass has no control over it. Copying passwords to the clipboard is a risk the user can chose to take or not take.

  There is already a warning at <https://keepass.info/help/kb/faq.html#clipovr> that says that other programs may record the contents of the clipboard.

  Hello,

  Don't you think that those two things are different ? :

  - using clipboard is at risk of malicious software accessing it

  - normal usage of keepass on fedora may leak credentials in clear in system journal.

  I do. The first one is a weakness, the second is a flaw.

  Fedora users must be aware of the problem. Other idea : what about having a paragraph in the security/security issues section of the keepass website ?

  I haven't noticed any other program (mail, office, browser, etc) for which using clipboard has a side effect of content being recorded in system journal. So even it is not directly done by keepass, could it has a relation with the way keepass relies on clipboard facility ?

  > could it has a relation with the way keepass relies on clipboard facility ?

  This is the reason. KeePass uses mono and workarounds for mono issues.

  If you are not happy with this situation you would be advised to use a native password manager, like KeeWeb or KeePassXC.

  Hello Paul,

  Who would be happy in using a password manager to increase its security and discovering by any chance that the solution leaks its credentials in clear in system logs ? The no warning information about this known problem as well as a perceived posture "not in my source code, not my problem" let me thinking that keepass has still not developed a full security conscience since the past 2016 disastrous initial position on its Man in the Middle flaw. That is a pity for such a good product, open source with great supporting community. Thanks for the tip, i am going to switch, sadly, to another password manager.

  No other program logs clipboard to the system log.

  Clipboard content is logged only when Keepass clears it. How is that an OS problem?

  Work around is to disable Keepass clipboard clearing in Fedora 35

  It does not occur in Windows, for which KeePass is written.

Latest version: 1.2.0

## Introduction

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of
the X selection. Normally this is only accessible by manually highlighting
information and pasting it with the middle mouse button.

* #### To read a file into the X selection:

  xsel < file

  after which you can paste the file's contents into any X application
  with the middle mouse button, as though you had highlighted its text.
  xsel will read in the file contents exactly, whereas manual
  highlighting invariably breaks lines and transforms tabs into spaces.
  This is especially handy for copying in large files.

* #### To write the X selection to a file:

  xsel > file

  after which file will contain exactly the contents of the X
  selection, without trailing newlines and spaces and crap.

XSel is more than just cat for the X selection.

* #### Append to the X selection:

  xsel --append < file

* #### To follow a growing file:

  xsel --follow < file

  to make the X selection follow standard input as it grows (like
  tail -f).

## Advanced features

XSel also lets you access some of the more esoteric features of the X
selection:

* #### Delete the contents of the selection

  xsel --delete

  Will cause the program in which text is selected to delete that text. This
  really works, you can try it on xedit to remotely delete text in
  the editor window.

* #### Manipulate the secondary selection

  The X Window System maintains two selections, the usual *primary*
  selection and a *secondary*, which isn't used much ...
  XSel lets you use the secondary selection, for example:

  #### To get and set the secondary selection:

  xsel --secondary < file

  xsel --secondary > file

  #### To swap the primary and secondary selections:

  xsel --exchange

  So for example you can store useful text in the secondary selection and
  retrieve it later.

  * #### Manipulate the clipboard selection

    Similarly, X has a *clipboard* selection. You can use the standard
    xclipboard program to manage a history of selected text, and you
    can use xsel to actually get text into that clipboard:

    xsel --clipboard < file

  * #### Make the selection contents persist in memory

    Normally the X selection only exists as long as the program it was selected
    in is running. Further, some buggy applications tend to forget their selection
    text after a little while. If you run:

    xsel --keep

    after selecting some important text, xsel will copy the text into
    its own memory so you can paste it elsewhere even if the original program
    exits or crashes.

Naturally all these options have single character equivalents, and
xsel --help provides usage information.
For complete details, see the [xsel man page](xsel.1x.html).

## Download

* #### XSel is available in most distributions.

  apt-get install xsel

  or a similar command will install the xsel package on your system.

* #### Source tarballs

  XSel is distributed in source form [here](download/)
  ([xsel-1.2.0.tar.gz](download/xsel-1.2.0.tar.gz)).
* #### Development versions are available via Git

  git clone git://github.com/kfish/xsel.git

  * #### Debian package info for xsel
