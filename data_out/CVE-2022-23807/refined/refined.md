Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in a sequence of actions a valid user can take that allows them to bypass two-factor authentication. A user has to first connect to phpMyAdmin (using their two-factor authentication method), which prepares their account for the bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Two-Factor Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that the application does not properly handle a specific user action sequence, allowing a bypass of the 2FA mechanism. This bypass can occur after a user has already authenticated with 2FA.
- **Improper Processing of User's 2FA Status:** The application has an unintentional security weakness in how it processes a user's two-factor status, which enables the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker who has already authenticated through 2FA can perform actions to bypass the 2FA on subsequent connections.
- It's important to note that an attacker can also disable 2FA via legitimate methods, which makes this bypass less critical.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A user must first authenticate using their valid 2FA method before the vulnerability can be exploited.
- After the initial authentication, a specific sequence of actions enables the bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must be a valid user with an existing account and has already authenticated with 2FA.
- **Initial Access:** Requires prior legitimate access to the application using a valid 2FA method to prepare their account for the bypass.
- **Knowledge of the Specific Actions:** The attacker needs to know the specific sequence of actions required to trigger the bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "not severe" due to the specific conditions needed for exploitation, as an attacker must first authenticate to prepare their account and can disable 2FA through conventional methods as well.
- The issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin versions 4.9.8 and 5.1.2, and later.
- The assigned CWE is CWE-661 which relates to the improper handling of a switch in the application.
