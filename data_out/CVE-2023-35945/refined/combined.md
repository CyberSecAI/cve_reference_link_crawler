# HTTP/2 memory leak in nghttp2 codec

High

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-jfxv-29pc-x22r
Jul 12, 2023

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

< 1.27.0

## Patched versions

1.26.3, 1.25.8, 1.24.9, 1.23.11

## Description

### Summary

Envoy’s HTTP/2 codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server.

### Affected Component

HTTP/2 codec

### Details

In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and pending compressed header.

The error return [code path](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/blob/e7f59406556c80904b81b593d38508591bb7523a/lib/nghttp2_session.c#L3346) is taken if connection is already marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame.

The clean-up code is right after the return statement, causing memory leak.

### PoC

* From H/2 server accept the connection from Envoy.
* Send `MAX CONCURRENT STREAMS` = 1
* After receiving request
* Send `RST_STREAM` for the request
* Send `GO_AWAY` with max stream is = 0.

Envoy needs a steady stream of requests from a client.

Upon receiving `RST_STREAM` Envoy frees up stream capacity on a connection and submits headers for the next request.

In the same I/O operation it also processes `GOAWAY` and marks connection to not send any more requests.

When processing outbound request queue nghttp2 enters the error handling branch due to connection marked for not sending more requests. In this branch there is no clean-up for the outbound request.

### Impact

Denial of service through memory exhaustion.

### Attack vector(s)

Specifically crafter response from an untrusted upstream service.

### Mitigation

None, apart from disabling HTTP/2 protocol for upstream services.

### Detection

Process termination due to out of memory conditions. If collection of memory profile is allowed, the profile will show memory consumed from the `submit_headers_shared` function in the `nghttp2_submit.c` file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
