## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to the server, alter information, create a denial-of-service condition, gain escalated privileges, and execute arbitrary code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following version of Sewio’s RTLS Studio, a Real-Time Location System (RTLS), is affected:

* RTLS Studio: version 2.0.0 up to and including version 2.6.2

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

**3.2.1 [USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**

Sewio’s Real-Time Location System (RTLS) Studio version 2.0.0 up to and including version 2.6.2 contains hard-coded passwords for select users in the application’s database. This could allow a remote attacker to login to the database with unrestricted access.

[CVE-2022-45444](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-45444) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.2 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**

Sewio’s Real-Time Location System (RTLS) Studio version 2.0.0 up to and including version 2.6.2 does not properly validate the input module name to the backup services of the software. This could allow a remote attacker to access sensitive functions of the application and execute arbitrary system commands.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Sewio has provided the following updates and recommends that users update to the latest version:

* RTLS Studio: Update to [version 3.0.0 or later](https://portal.sewio.net/login) (requires login) (Only for the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-47911, CVE-2022-43483, CVE-2022-45127, CVE-2022-47395, CVE-2022-47917, CVE-2022-46733, CVE-2022-43455)

Sewio also recommends the following workarounds to reduce the risk of exploitation:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* For CVE-2022-45444: Manually change the database password.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
