# Bluetooth: ASCS Unchecked tailroom of the response buffer

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-m22j-ccg7-4v4h
Oct 4, 2024

## Package

zephyr
(zephyr)

## Affected versions

<=3.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

In `ascs_cp_rsp_add` in `/subsys/bluetooth/audio/ascs.c`, an unchecked tailroom could lead to a global buffer overflow.

### Details

The function `ascs_cp_rsp_add` is invoked by multiple operations such as `ascs_config`, `ascs_qos`, etc.

The maximum number of ASEs can be up to the value of `uint8_t`, and this is iterated over in a for loop:

```
	...
	req = net_buf_simple_pull_mem(buf, sizeof(*req));

	LOG_DBG("num_ases %u", req->num_ases);

	for (uint8_t i = 0; i < req->num_ases; i++) {
	...

```

As the loop iterates, `ascs_cp_rsp_add` may be called multiple times.

Within `ascs_cp_rsp_add`, the function `net_buf_simple_add` is used to add data to `rsp_buf`:

```
	ase_rsp = net_buf_simple_add(&rsp_buf, sizeof(*ase_rsp));
	ase_rsp->id = id;
	ase_rsp->code = code;
	ase_rsp->reason = reason;

```

The buffer `rsp_buf` is defined statically using a macro with size `CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_MTU`:

```
NET_BUF_SIMPLE_DEFINE_STATIC(rsp_buf, CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_MTU);

```

Each time `ascs_cp_rsp_add` is called, `sizeof(*ase_rsp)`, which is 3 bytes, is added to the buffer.

However, there is a missing check for available tailroom before adding data to the buffer.

If `ascs_cp_rsp_add` is called multiple times by a large `num_ases`, it could lead to a global buffer overflow in subsequent code:

```
	ase_rsp = net_buf_simple_add(&rsp_buf, sizeof(*ase_rsp));
	ase_rsp->id = id;
	ase_rsp->code = code;
	ase_rsp->reason = reason;

```
### PoC

Set the `CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_MTU` parameter to 253, which is the default value as defined in autoconf.h.

Set the `num_ases` in the `req` to a value greater than 85, ensuring that the resulting size exceeds the capacity of `rsp_buf`, since 85×3>253.

### Impact

An out-of-bounds write in a global variable can result in system instability, potentially leading to crashes or denial of service (DoS) attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
