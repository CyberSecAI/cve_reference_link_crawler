## Why Flowmon

#### Scale Indefinitely

Flowmon offers limitless scalability thanks to a futureproof flow-based engine that delivers a level of detail comparable to packet-based solutions at a fraction of the resource requirements. Full-packet data is available on-demand and on-event packet capture when needed.

#### Improve Your Security and Boost Operations

Detect ransomware, expose insider threats and respond to them quickly while keeping your network transparent and problem-free. Flowmon provides a unified source of truth to both network and security teams and cuts the cost of functional duplicity between tools.

#### Visibility Into Every Branch

Eliminate visibility blind spots by analyzing data from diverse environments using proprietary and 3rd-party data sources and normalizing diverse data formats to gain insights from virtual, on-prem, edge and cloud traffic in one place.

#### Automate Routine

Minimize time spent on routine tasks by leveraging on-demand and on-event packet capture with automated root-cause analysis.

### Second Time in a Row: Progress Flowmon Named a Technology Leader in Network Detection and Response

Released in 2024, the SPARK Matrix™ report, conducted by Quadrant Knowledge Solutions, provides market insights, competitive evaluation and vendor rankings to better understand the capabilities of different solutions in the network detection and response (NDR) market. In the Customer Impact and Technology Excellence category, they awarded Progress Flowmon NDR the highest ranking of Technology Leader.

[Get the report](/resources/papers/spark-matrix-ndr-2024)

“The installation of Flowmon is very simple and intuitive. Thanks to Flowmon, we are provided with network visibility that we previously lacked. As a consequence we can identify the causes of network issues easier than ever before. The solution also allows us to design the proper capacity of our network. We plan to enforce network monitoring solution deployment across all 11 group offices and 20 facilities.”
