Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36263:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to a SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `tableName`, `fieldName`, and `fieldVal` parameters in the `/api/sys/duplicateCheck` endpoint are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or denial of service. This could involve reading the entire database.

**Attack vectors:**
*  HTTP GET request to `/api/sys/duplicateCheck` with malicious SQL code injected in parameters like `tableName`, `fieldName` and `fieldVal`. 
* The provided example demonstrates injection through parameters such as `tableName=sys_user&amp;fieldName=1+*+and+user_name&amp;fieldVal=admin`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This implies network access to the server. 
*  No specific privileges are mentioned in the report.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Apache Submarine Server Core.
*   The project is retired, and no patch is planned.
*   The provided Github link `https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1121` is related to a hotfix for this SQL Injection, indicating that this was the way it was handled.
