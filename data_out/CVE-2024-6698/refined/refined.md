**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FundEngine plugin does not properly verify user meta updates performed via the `update_user_meta` function, allowing unauthorized modifications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users to modify their own user meta data.
- Improper use of `update_user_meta`: The plugin does not validate the keys being updated, allowing arbitrary meta keys to be modified by authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain administrator-level access by updating their user capabilities, leading to full control over the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated access: The attack vector is through the WordPress user interface by exploiting a vulnerability in the plugin via a crafted request.
- Direct modification of user meta:  The plugin doesn't restrict which user meta keys can be updated, allowing modification of user roles.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker must have an account with at least subscriber-level access, which is a common user level in WordPress.
- Access to the WordPress instance: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WordPress site directly.
