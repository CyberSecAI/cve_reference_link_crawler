## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-02-09: Contacted support email zimocode@gmail.com. No response.
* 2024-03-15: Github repo moved to archived and read only. Assume maintainer has stopped supporting product.
* 2024-05-22: Contacted Microsoft Extension Add On Store to remove extension from Microsoft Store.

## Summary

A universal XSS is present in the Edge and Firefox versions of Smartup, allowing another extension to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user’s tab.

## Project

smartup

## Tested Version

[7.2.622.1170](https://github.com/zimocode/smartup)

## Details

### [Universal XSS in Smartup](https://github.com/zimocode/smartup/blob/2144ec161697751b1a6702f1af866726ea689e4e/js/background.js#L3800) (`GHSL-2024-011`)

The smartup gestures extension receives messages from external extensions without checking the identity of the sender. The external input is then sent to `funOnMessage`, which calls `executeScript` on the external message with the context of the current tab.

```
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(function(message,sender,sendResponse){
	sub.funOnMessage(message,sender,sendResponse);              <----- message is user controlled
})

...

case"apps_test":
	let _fun=function(){
		if(message.appjs){
			chrome.tabs.executeScript({code:"sue.apps['"+message.apptype+"'].initUI();",runAt:"document_start"});      <----- message is passed into executeScript
			return;
		}

```

A malicious extension may be able to run arbitrary javascript in the context of a user’s tab, compromising accounts that the user logins into.

This vulnerability was found with the help of [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql).

This issue may lead to `Universal XSS`
