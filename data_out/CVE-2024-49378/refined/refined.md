Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Smartup browser extension for Edge and Firefox does not properly validate the origin of messages received from other extensions. It directly passes external messages to the `funOnMessage` function, which then uses `executeScript` to execute the message's content as JavaScript in the context of the current user's tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS):** The primary vulnerability is a UXSS. Due to the lack of sender verification, any malicious extension can send a crafted message to the Smartup extension.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The `message` parameter is taken directly from external input and passed into the `executeScript` function without any sanitization or validation.
- **Lack of Sender Verification:** The `chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal` listener does not check the identity of the sending extension, which allows any extension to send a message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A malicious extension can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of any open tab of the user using Smartup extension, as the code runs within the website's context within the tab.
- **Account Compromise:** This could lead to sensitive information theft, session hijacking, or complete account compromise for any website the user is logged into.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious code could be used to steal data displayed on webpages or manipulate the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Browser Extension:** The attack requires an attacker to create and distribute a malicious browser extension.
- **Message Passing:** The malicious extension sends a crafted message via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or a similar API to exploit the `chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal` listener of the Smartup extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create and Distribute a Browser Extension:** The attacker must be able to create and publish a malicious extension for Edge/Firefox.
- **User Must Install Both Extensions:** The user must have both the vulnerable Smartup extension installed, and the malicious extension must also be installed on the same browser.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet from `background.js`:
```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(function(message,sender,sendResponse){
	sub.funOnMessage(message,sender,sendResponse);
})
...
case"apps_test":
	let _fun=function(){
		if(message.appjs){
			chrome.tabs.executeScript({code:"sue.apps['"+message.apptype+"'].initUI();",runAt:"document_start"});
			return;
		}
```
- The `message.apptype` is embedded in the `executeScript` call, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary javascript in the current tab.

The vulnerability is described as a "universal XSS" because it allows an attacker to execute script in the context of any webpage the user visits, regardless of the webpage's domain.
