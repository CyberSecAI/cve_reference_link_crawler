- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LoadLogic and LoadZilla applications create Lambda functions (LogicLoadEc2DeployLambda and CredsGenFunction) with overly permissive IAM and STS actions (specifically, `sts:AssumeRole` and generic IAM operations).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of restrictions on IAM and STS actions, allowing privilege escalation.
    - The vulnerable code creates two functions with excessive permissions.
    -  Improper permission management in Lambda functions.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Malicious users with the ability to modify the Lambda function can escalate their privileges by using the provided permissions.
    - The overly permissive IAM actions allow an attacker to create or modify IAM roles/policies, and assume roles to access AWS resources that should be protected.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Modifying the AWS Lambda functions `LogicLoadEc2DeployLambda` and `CredsGenFunction`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have permissions to change the AWS Lambda functions created by LoadLogic and LoadZilla. This is a high privilege requirement.
    - The attacker is assumed to be an internal actor as indicated by the "Local" attack vector.
