# Potential risk in the LoadLogic and LoadZilla which can lead to privilege escalation

High

[zolaer9527](/zolaer9527)
published
GHSA-3ggq-wrf4-c88v
Sep 27, 2024

## Package

LoadLogic

## Affected versions

<1.4.3

## Patched versions

1.4.3

LoadZilla

<4.0.4

4.0.4

## Description

### Summary

The LoadLogic and LoadZilla provide the functionality to deploy the Loadzilla server and agents on AWS. If an actor has permission to change the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

### Impact

The LoadLogic and LoadZilla applications create two functions which are LogicLoadEc2DeployLambda and CredsGenFunction. Both of them provides access to the sts:AssumeRole and IAM operations without further restrictions. Therefore, a malicious user can use these permissions in multiple ways to enhance their privileges.

**Impacted LoadLogic versions: <1.4.3**

**Impacted LoadZilla versions: <4.0.4**

### Workarounds

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary [1] to the roles created by LoadLogic and LoadZilla in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. Besides, use a specific resource name instead of "\*" to restrict the scope of the permissions effects.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
