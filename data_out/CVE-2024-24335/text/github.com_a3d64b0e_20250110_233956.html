| Hi,  I would like to report a potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. As directed, I'm opening an issue here. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential buffer overflow in RT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystemSummary I spotted a potential buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the RT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystem source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/dfs/dfs_v2/filesystems/romfs/dfs_romfs.c#L353-L355> Details Lack of length check in the `dfs_romfs_getdents()` function could lead to a buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` static int dfs_romfs_getdents(struct dfs_file *file, struct dirent *dirp, uint32_t count) {     rt_size_t index;     const char *name;     struct dirent *d;     struct romfs_dirent *dirent, *sub_dirent;      dirent = (struct romfs_dirent *)file->vnode->data;     if (check_dirent(dirent) != 0)     {         return -EIO;     }     RT_ASSERT(dirent->type == ROMFS_DIRENT_DIR);      /* enter directory */     dirent = (struct romfs_dirent *)dirent->data;      /* make integer count */     count = (count / sizeof(struct dirent));     if (count == 0)     {         return -EINVAL;     }      index = 0;     for (index = 0; index < count && file->fpos < file->vnode->size; index++)     {         d = dirp + index;          sub_dirent = &dirent[file->fpos];         name = sub_dirent->name;          /* fill dirent */         if (sub_dirent->type == ROMFS_DIRENT_DIR)             d->d_type = DT_DIR;         else             d->d_type = DT_REG;          d->d_namlen = rt_strlen(name);         d->d_reclen = (rt_uint16_t)sizeof(struct dirent);         rt_strncpy(d->d_name, name, rt_strlen(name) + 1); /* VULN: buffer overflow if rt_strlen(name) is larger than sizeof(d->d_name) due to missing length check */          /* move to next position */         ++ file->fpos;     }      return index * sizeof(struct dirent); } ```  Please note that dfs\_v1 romfs source code at <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/dfs/dfs_v1/filesystems/romfs/dfs_romfs.c#L335-L340> is not affected, because the string copy operation is implemented differently:  ```         len = rt_strlen(name);         RT_ASSERT(len <= RT_UINT8_MAX);         d->d_namlen = (rt_uint8_t)len;         d->d_reclen = (rt_uint16_t)sizeof(struct dirent);         rt_strncpy(d->d_name, name, DFS_PATH_MAX); ```  Even if the assertion is compiled-out in production code, `len` is not used for the copy operation anyway. Therefore, unless DFS\_PATH\_MAX is larger than sizeof(d->d\_name), this code should be safe. Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Thank you for letting me know! I've opened some other issues related to different vulnerabilities. I'm available if you need any clarifications. For any confirmed vulnerability (including this one), once they're fixed I'm planning to request a CVE ID from Mitre. Let me know in case you prefer to handle this yourself. |
