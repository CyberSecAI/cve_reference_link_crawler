    "Status": "Relevant",
    "Content": "This document provides details about CVE-2021-2422 as part of a larger advisory concerning multiple MySQL vulnerabilities affecting NetApp products and is also listed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021. \n\n**NetApp Advisory (NTAP-20210723-0001):**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in certain versions of Oracle MySQL, which are incorporated into multiple NetApp products. The specific root cause of the vulnerability is not detailed in this document, but it is a part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in the July 2021 Oracle Critical Patch Update.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The document refers to a vulnerability in the \"Server: PS\" component of MySQL, which can lead to a potential denial of service.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.  This could also lead to unauthorized takeover of the MySQL Server or unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL server accessible data. \n*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is described as \"MySQL Protocol\", indicating the vulnerability is reachable through network requests using the MySQL protocol.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The advisory indicates that exploitation requires high privileges, which suggests that an attacker must possess a valid and privileged user account.\n\n**Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is not specifically described in the advisory document beyond referencing it as related to MySQL Server.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Oracle advisory identifies the vulnerability as part of a broader set affecting MySQL Server and its various components. Specifically, CVE-2021-2422 is associated with \"Server: PS.\"\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** The Oracle document also does not provide specific details on impact for CVE-2021-2422 but generally describes that successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification of data, or DoS.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is described as \"MySQL Protocol\" which indicates the vulnerability is reachable through network requests using the MySQL protocol.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The Oracle advisory indicates that exploitation requires high privileges, suggesting the attacker requires a valid user account with the ability to invoke the vulnerable code or functionality. This means the vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication."
