- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to HTML injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, potentially gaining low-privileged access to the affected device. The attacker can also interact with a user via a dialog box.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject malicious HTML code via a network request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
