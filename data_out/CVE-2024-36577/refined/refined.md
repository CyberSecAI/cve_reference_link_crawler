Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Module.setNestedProperty` function within the `@apphp/object-resolver` module. This function recursively copies properties from a source to a destination object without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The lack of validation in `setNestedProperty` allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads by using the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` within the supplied input. This enables the attacker to modify the prototype of the built-in `Object`.
- **Unsafe Recursive Copy:** The recursive nature of the property copying process, when combined with the lack of input validation, allows the attacker to write arbitrary values into object prototypes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, attackers can cause unexpected behavior, making the application unstable or inoperable.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some contexts, modifying object prototypes could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If the application is vulnerable to XSS, the prototype pollution may be used to introduce malicious scripts that can compromise users' browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Input:**  An attacker can supply a crafted input that contains malicious payloads using `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties to the vulnerable `setNestedProperty` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input that is passed to the `setNestedProperty` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable versions of the `@apphp/object-resolver` module are those prior to 3.1.1.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use the `__proto__.polluted` property to add a new property to the prototype of objects.
- The fix is to update the module to version 3.1.1 or later.
