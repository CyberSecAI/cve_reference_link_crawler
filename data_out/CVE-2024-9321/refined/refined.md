Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Broken Access Control (Improper Access Control)** in the SourceCodester Online Railway Reservation System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate access controls:** The application fails to properly restrict access to the `/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` endpoint, allowing unauthorized users to view inquiry details.
*   **Direct object reference:** The application uses the `id` parameter in the URL to directly access inquiry details without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of confidentiality:** This could lead to a breach of privacy for the users of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable endpoint (`/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php`) by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the system to exploit the vulnerability.
