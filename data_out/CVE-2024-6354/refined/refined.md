- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in the PAM (Privileged Access Management) dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated user can bypass the execute permission via the PAM dashboard.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing of execute permissions within the PAM dashboard. This is considered a low-severity issue because it does not expose credentials beyond what the user already has access to.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the PAM dashboard by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Remote Desktop Manager application.
