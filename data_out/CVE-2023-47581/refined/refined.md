Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability. This means the software attempts to access memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data from a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information stored in memory outside of the intended buffer, which could lead to further exploits.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file.
*   The attack vector is local, as indicated by "AV:L" in the CVSS vector. This suggests that the attacker needs to have local access to the system or be able to trick the user into opening the crafted file on their local system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious file.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges and the user interaction is required. This is shown as "PR:N/UI:R" in the CVSS vector.

**Affected Products:**

*   TELLUS V4.0.17.0 and earlier
*   TELLUS Lite V4.0.17.0 and earlier

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information confirms that the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) and that successful exploitation could result in information disclosure and potentially arbitrary code execution
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.8 which is considered high.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted file.
