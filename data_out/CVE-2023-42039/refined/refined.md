{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF, in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious PDF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file with oversized data to trigger the buffer overflow."
