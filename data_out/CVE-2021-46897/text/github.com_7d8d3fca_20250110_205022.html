| Thanks for reporting! This will be fixed in 0.22.3  Luckily, the impact of this is lessened since this URL only works for logged-in users.  And as a reminder to anyone reading this: you SHOULD NOT run your web server with root permission (or any account with filesystem permissions outside your application directory). |
