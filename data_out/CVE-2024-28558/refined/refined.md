Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `web_crud.php` file in the `/admin/app/` directory of the "Petrol pump management software".
- User-supplied input from the `id` parameter in a POST request is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, this occurs on line 225 and 227 of the `web_crud.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be injected through the vulnerable `id` parameter, leading to unauthorized database access.
-  The application is susceptible to error-based, time-based blind, boolean-based blind, and stacked query SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has DBA privileges, attackers might gain server host privileges.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `web_crud.php` file. The `id` parameter within the POST body is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to log in to the website to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability. They simply need to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `web_crud.php` file with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `admin/app/web_crud.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `id` (in POST request)
- Vulnerable Line: 225 of web_crud.php
- Attack Type: SQL Injection
- Example Payload:
```
update3=yes&encryption=1&host=1&port=1&username=1&password=2&email=1&id=1' AND (SELECT * FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x01,(SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(schema_name AS NCHAR),0x20)),1,54) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 6,1),0x00,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)--
```

This payload is designed to extract the database name, which is one potential way to verify the existence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
