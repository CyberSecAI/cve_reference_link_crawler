**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787):** The vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds write, where the application writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption.
- This corruption can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is opening a malicious DICOM (DCM) file in the MicroDicom DICOM Viewer.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious DICOM file.
- The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious file on a vulnerable system.
- The attack is local, meaning the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability remotely. The attacker must have the malicious file available to the victim on the local machine.
