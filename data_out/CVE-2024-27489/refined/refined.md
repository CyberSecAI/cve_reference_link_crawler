Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `DelFile()` function in `admin/action/novel/novel.txt.php` lacks security filtering. It directly uses user-controlled input (`path` parameter) to delete files, allowing deletion of arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The `$cPath` variable in `admin/index.php` is controllable and not filtered, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files. This can be exploited using PEARCMD to inject and execute PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Deletion:** The `DelFile()` function does not validate or sanitize the provided file path, leading to arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Unfiltered File Inclusion:** The `$cPath` variable, used to include files, is not sanitized or validated, allowing inclusion of arbitrary files and ultimately leading to RCE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server, potentially disrupting operations, causing data loss, or even preventing the system from functioning.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system. This could lead to data breaches, malware installation, and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The attacker sends a POST request to `admin/index.php?a=yes&c=novel.txt&t=del` with a `path` parameter specifying the file to be deleted.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   The attacker exploits the unfiltered `$cPath` variable in `admin/index.php`.
    *   Utilizes PEARCMD to inject malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** To exploit the arbitrary file deletion, the attacker needs an account with administrative privileges to log in to the WMCMS admin panel and obtain the necessary cookies.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WMCMS server to send HTTP requests and exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable file for arbitrary file deletion is `admin/action/novel/novel.txt.php` within WMCMS v4.4.
*   The RCE is achieved through the `admin/index.php` file by manipulating the `c` parameter and using PEARCMD.
*   The provided content includes detailed steps to reproduce both arbitrary file deletion and RCE vulnerabilities, along with example HTTP requests and parameters.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by user Y.
