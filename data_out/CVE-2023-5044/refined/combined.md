| Issue Details A security issue was identified in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation on an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) can be used to inject arbitrary commands, and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.  This issue has been rated **High** ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)), and assigned **[CVE-2023-5044](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fp9f-44c2-cw27 "CVE-2023-5044")**. Affected Components and Configurations This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running `kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.  If you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in v1.2.0 (gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot), command execution is possible but credential extraction is not, so the High severity does not apply.  Multi-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue. Affected Versions  * <v1.9.0  Versions allowing mitigation  * v1.9.0  Mitigation Ingress Administrators should set the --enable-annotation-validation flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields. Detection If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io Additional Details See ingress-nginx Issue [#10572](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126817) for more details. Acknowledgements This vulnerability was reported by Jan-Otto Kröpke (Cloudeteer GmbH)  Thank You, CJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee |

| [@ealasgarov](https://github.com/ealasgarov) I *think* `1.9.0` is correct and intended, as it's referring to the controller version not the underlying `nginx` version.  I'm assuming that since `1.9.0` of the controller is when the `--enable-annotation-validation` flag + feature was added  <https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.9.0> |

| [@stromvirvel](https://github.com/stromvirvel) each annotation has a risk weight/grade - the annotation validation flag alone won't be of much use, since the default threshold is `Critical`, so you need to enable both `--enable-annotation-validation` and add the threshold for risk-level under the configmap, eg `annotations-risk-level: High`.  As for figuring out the threshold, you'll need to go through the codebase, afaik there's no documentation for each of these - best I could find was this test file: [kubernetes/ingress-nginx@c5f348e#diff-1cf51e128ca991f6d8ea012512e57cf68e224e64ff68e2401d9a598e4da98837R70-R74](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/commit/c5f348ea2eec5f15ab0d5c5e976b29d6787fd3dc#diff-1cf51e128ca991f6d8ea012512e57cf68e224e64ff68e2401d9a598e4da98837R70-R74)  There you can see `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin`  (`authReqSigninAnnotation`) has a `Risk` of High (`AnnotationRiskHigh`), so you'd configure `annotations-risk-level` as `High` (ie: the highest risk among all of your used annotations). Hope this is somewhat clear |

I have plans to automate the documentation generation for this annotations (risk, description and eventually the validation) but didn't had the opportunity to do it yet (tho I've left the majority of code ready for it).  Sorry for that, we had to rush on implementation and missed this |

| Hey folks,  As this CVE has been opened for 1 week now, I'm closing the issue.  The description of the issue contains all the required mitigations, and we plan in future releases to turn the validation on by default and also implement more safety measures.  Thank you all for using the project, and for your continuous support for us.  /close |

Subject: [kubernetes] CVE-2023-5044: Code injection via nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect
 annotation

Issue Details

A security issue was identified in ingress-nginx
<<https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx>> where the
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation on an Ingress
object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) can be used
to inject arbitrary commands, and obtain the credentials of the
ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has
access to all secrets in the cluster.

This issue has been rated High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
<<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L>>),
and assigned CVE-2023-5044.
Affected Components and Configurations

This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed
on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running
`kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.

If you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in
v1.2.0 (gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot), command
execution is possible but credential extraction is not, so the High
severity does not apply.

Multi-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create
Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.
Affected Versions

   -

   <v1.9.0

Versions allowing mitigation

   -

   v1.9.0

Mitigation

Ingress Administrators should set the --enable-annotation-validation flag
to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.
Detection

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please
contact security@...ernetes.io
Additional Details

See ingress-nginx Issue #10572
<<https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10572>> for more details.
