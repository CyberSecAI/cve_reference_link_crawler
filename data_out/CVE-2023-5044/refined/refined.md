Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-5044:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation of the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` annotation within the ingress-nginx controller. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the nginx configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` annotation can be used to inject arbitrary commands due to insufficient validation.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The ingress-nginx controller doesn't properly sanitize or validate the contents of the `permanent-redirect` annotation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Command Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the ingress-nginx controller.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker can obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller, which, in a default configuration, has access to all secrets in the Kubernetes cluster. This provides full access to the cluster.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information can be exposed by gaining access to the secrets.
- **Data Modification:**  An attacker could potentially add or modify data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to send a request to the ingress-nginx controller.
- **Ingress Object Modification:** Attackers can inject malicious commands via a crafted `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect` annotation within an Ingress object in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Permissions to create/modify Ingress Objects:** Attackers need the ability to create or modify Ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster. This is particularly relevant in multi-tenant environments where non-admin users might have such permissions.
- **Network access to the ingress-nginx controller.**

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to set the `--enable-annotation-validation` flag for the ingress-nginx controller. This flag enforces restrictions on the contents of the annotation fields.
- Additionally, the `annotations-risk-level` configmap should be set to `High` or higher to validate annotations marked as having High risk
- Upgrading to ingress-nginx version v1.9.0 or higher.

**Affected versions:**
- ingress-nginx versions prior to v1.9.0

**Unaffected configurations**
- Clusters not running the ingress-nginx controller are not affected
- Clusters running the "chrooted" ingress-nginx controller (introduced in v1.2.0) are vulnerable to command injection but not to credential extraction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered high severity with a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- The issue was publicly disclosed and discussed.
- NetApp products are not affected
