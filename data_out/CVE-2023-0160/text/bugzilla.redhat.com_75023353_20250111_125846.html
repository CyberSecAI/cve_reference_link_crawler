Or ask John Fastabend , because he said (in the same discussion): "Thanks, I'll take a look.".  Alex   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2159764#c9)  Alex    2023-07-16 11:24:39 UTC  ``` Got reply from the reporter regarding this one:  Hi Alex,  The bug was fixed in ed17aa92dc56 ("bpf, sockmap: Revert buggy deadlock fix in the sockhash and sockmap")  The fix basically disables hardirq instead of only softirq in the critical section in delete() in sockmap/sockhash since an element can be deleted from an eBPF program in the interrupt context (hardirq).  Thanks, Hsin-Wei   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2159764#c10)  Alex    2023-07-16 11:44:16 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2223191](show_bug.cgi?id=2223191 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-0160 kernel: possibility of deadlock in libbpf function sock_hash_delete_elem [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2159764#c11)  Justin M. Forbes    2023-07-18 18:37:02 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 6.2.15 stable kernel updates.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2159764#c12)  Steve Beattie    2023-07-18 19:43:20 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, ed17aa92dc56 ("bpf, sockmap: Revert buggy deadlock fix in the sockhash and sockmap") was reverted upstream in 8c5c2a4898e3 ("bpf, sockmap: Revert buggy deadlock fix in the sockhash and sockmap"), which was also backported as part of the 6.2.15 stable kernel update (commit 3cd6ab3b5451).   ``` |  |
