{
  "CVE-2023-43641": {
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds array access in Libcue, a library for parsing CD metadata, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The `track_set_index` function in `cd.c` does not check if the provided index is negative before accessing an array, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The index is parsed from the cue sheet file using `atoi` which does not check for integer overflows and can return negative values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to the out-of-bounds write.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Malicious cue sheet file",
        "Exploiting a flaw in the parsing library used by applications that handle cue sheets."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted cue sheet file with a negative index value. A user needs to interact with the file, for example, by downloading it. In the case of GNOME's tracker-miners, the vulnerability can be triggered automatically when the file is saved in a directory scanned by tracker-miners such as the `~/Downloads` folder."
