RELATED: The provided content shows a commit related to encrypting JWT values in the `anything-llm` project. This aligns with the description of the CVE which relates to a vulnerability fix in the same project.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from storing the password ('p' property) unencrypted in the JWT. This could be exploited if the JWT is compromised.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Storing sensitive information (password) in JWT without encryption

Impact of exploitation:
- Unauthorized access if the JWT is compromised.
- Potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.

Attack vectors:
- An attacker gaining access to the JWT.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to intercept or steal a valid JWT to exploit the vulnerability before the fix was implemented.
