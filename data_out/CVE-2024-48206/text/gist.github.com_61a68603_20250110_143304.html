|  | ## CVE-2024-48206: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Chainer’s Chainermn |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### Description |
|  | A vulnerability in Chainer v7.8.1.post1 allows for the deserialization of untrusted data, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. The issue is located in the `chainermn` module, specifically in the communication utility component responsible for handling data exchange between nodes in a distributed system. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted serialized payloads that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary commands. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vulnerability Type |
|  | - CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Product Code Base |
|  | - Chainer v7.8.1.post1 (https://github.com/chainer/chainer) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Component |
|  | - `chainermn/communicators/\_communication\_utility.py` (https://github.com/chainer/chainer/blob/a8e15cbe55a90854a3918b8b5a976abbbff9ec94/chainermn/communicators/\_communication\_utility.py#L171) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Type |
|  | - Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ### Impact |
|  | - Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Vectors |
|  | Exploitation occurs through the deserialization of untrusted data within the communication utility of Chainer’s `chainermn` module. Attackers can craft payloads that, when processed by the vulnerable function, result in code execution. |
|  |  |
