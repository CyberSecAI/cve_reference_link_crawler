That's roughly what I had done earlier this week (handpicking the
commits that could impact our users), but this doesn't address my second
point as it won't catch any new CVE introduced before that tree that
wasn't fixed.
(also probably a bit more efficient to go by version tag since we have
the info in the json, more below)

Right; I don't need this to be 100% complete -- as long as a couple of
issues turn up it's probably good enough motivation.

In practice just listing a bunch of numbers probably won't change the
way people think, so I'm taking the time to briefly describe potential
impacts (what component, very broad trigger conditions e.g. network
packet or local access, likely risk if exploited e.g. RCE, memory
leak...); so ultimately it requires looking at things in more details
than I have time to check for all CVEs and will likely keep checking a
few "juicy" ones...
But it's a very good point, we should check again regularly and update
that list if some new bad thing stands out.

I didn't think of checking the mails, that's certainly easier to grep
than json as it's line-oriented.
It's going to take a bit more of processing to check not just bugs that
were backported in the stable trees, but things introduced in earlier
kernels... Someting like this?

  rg -l 'Issue introduced in ([234]\.[0-9]* |5\.[0-9] |5\.10\.[0-9]* )' | sort > introduced_before_5.10
  xargs rg -l 'fixed in 5\.10' < introduced_before_5.10 | sort > fixed_in_5.10
  comm -3 introduced_before_5.10 fixed_in_5.10 |tail
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-35844.mbox
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-35904.mbox
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-35951.mbox
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-35971.mbox
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-36009.mbox
cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-36013.mbox
   grep 'Issue introdu' cve/published/2024/CVE-2024-35971.mbox
Issue introduced in 5.8 with commit 797047f875b5 and fixed in 6.1.87 with commit 492337a4fbd1
Issue introduced in 5.8 with commit 797047f875b5 and fixed in 6.6.28 with commit cba376eb036c
Issue introduced in 5.8 with commit 797047f875b5 and fixed in 6.8.7 with commit 49d5d70538b6
Issue introduced in 5.8 with commit 797047f875b5 and fixed in 6.9 with commit be0384bf599c

The regex is a bit too manual to make a generic search script, and that
feels very kludgy (at least mbox files do look like they get updated
together with json), but that can be enough for my local needs for now.

I was thinking something more along the line of parsing all the json
files for containers.cna.affected by release version item (versionType
!= git);
It should be possible for a given stable tag to check if a given CVE
applies or not immediately so it would be a matter of making this a bit
more searchable -- probably make a reverse index with all the edges for
faster search and keep appending new CVEs as they pop up.

But it's a bit more work, so I'll gratefully take the grep mailboxes
version for now :)

Yes, these (basically patches without a Fixes:) will always be
problematic; basically would need to also check all mails with "Fixed in
[newer versions]" without the "Issue introduced in" text.

Capitalization on Fixed can differentiate this so something like this?

  rg -l 'Issue introduced in ([234]\.[0-9]* |5\.[0-9] |5\.10\.[0-9]* )|Fixed in'

This is bringing up the list of candidates from 101 to 543 so the
initial check is going to be "fun"; I'll probably stick to the first
variant for now...

Also, in this case the json properly defaults to affected so a search by
json as suggested above would also turn them up for further inspection.

Well, either way we won't get around the problem that much manual work
is still required; as said in my first mail my time is quite limited but
I'll try to check a few from time to time.

Ideally we'll want to limit duplicating this work for other
downstreams... So:
 - get more people to look at these
   - if unaffected (e.g. CVE-2024-35867 you singled out above as not
     affecting 5.10), report it so the reference files can be updated
   - if affected backport patch, so it can be fixed and the refernece
     file can also be updated.
 - less work for everyone else!

But finding volunteers for that kind of work might not be quite as easy
as I make it sound like :)

Cheers,

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap\_connect()Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap\_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap\_connect()commit 4d7b41c0e43995b0e992b9f8903109275744b658 upstream.
Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap\_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

Great.  Only you know your use cases, which is why we do not offer up
any "grading" of kernel CVEs as Linux is used in so many different ways.

The mbox files do get updated along with the json, but please, let's not
parse mbox files, that was a bad example I gave here, sorry.

That might be good, but really, we already have the needed information
here with the tool that creates all of this 'dyad', in the scripts/
directory.  The output of that should be _much_ easier to parse:

$ ./scripts/dyad be0384bf599c
# ./scripts/dyad version: efdbc505ff2f
# 	getting vulnerable:fixed pairs for git id be0384bf599cf1eb8d337517feeb732d71f75a6f

5.8:797047f875b5463719cc70ba213eb691d453c946:6.8.7:49d5d70538b6b8f2a3f8f1ac30c1f921d4a0929b

That tool generates a list of "vulnerable:fixed" pairs of version and
git ids.  I have thought about checking in that output into the git repo
as odds are that would be easier than forcing you to regenerate it all
the time.

Here you see that the 5.10.y branch does not have a fix yet, and might
be easier than parsing the json files (which also show this), unless you
have a good json parser (i.e. something other than just bash.)

This output also catches where we introduce, and then fix, the issue in
the same release.  dyad will show this, but as the issue never was in a
public release, CVE will not let us list it as that isn't relevent
there.  But it IS relevent for those that might cherry-pick random
commits.

Sure, that would be great.  Usually when a commit is NOT in an older
branch, that means it either did not apply, or it might be queued up for
the next release.  Or sometimes, the stable developers just didn't know
it needed to be backported at the time.  We probably should just sweep
the current ids and catch that last issue now to make it easier for
others going forward.  I'll add that to my long todo list...

Agreed, or again, look at how dyad works, that might be simpler too, at
the expense that you have to compute it all the time, and it isn't the
quickest tool around (it's in bash and has not been optimized at all,
sorry.)

Yes, if we "know" when a specific fix actually is introduced, we can add
that to our tools to properly catch and mark the entries.  That
information would be great to have.

Too true, there are very few of us actually working on this type of
thing, despite all of the people actually relying on it :(

Any help is greatly appreciated.

I will call out, we have had help from many developers from SuSE in
reviewing the current CVE entries and helping find duplicates and issues
we shouldn't have marked as such.  And we have help from other
developers at other companies in doing reviews and seeing if commits
should, or should not, get CVE entries.  All of that help is greatly
appreciated and we can always use more.

thanks,

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap\_connect()commit 4d7b41c0e43995b0e992b9f8903109275744b658 upstream.
Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap\_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.
Call stack summary:
[use]
l2cap\_bredr\_sig\_cmd
l2cap\_connect
┌ mutex\_lock(&conn->chan\_lock);
│ chan = pchan->ops->new\_connection(pchan); <- alloc chan
│ \_\_l2cap\_chan\_add(conn, chan);
│ l2cap\_chan\_hold(chan);
│ list\_add(&chan->list, &conn->chan\_l); ... (1)
└ mutex\_unlock(&conn->chan\_lock);
chan->conf\_state ... (4) <- use after free
[free]
l2cap\_conn\_del
┌ mutex\_lock(&conn->chan\_lock);
│ foreach chan in conn->chan\_l: ... (2)
│ l2cap\_chan\_put(chan);
│ l2cap\_chan\_destroy
│ kfree(chan) ... (3) <- chan freed
└ mutex\_unlock(&conn->chan\_lock);
