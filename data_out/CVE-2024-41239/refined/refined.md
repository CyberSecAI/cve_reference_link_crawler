    ],
    "impact": "The presence of a stored XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the application. Since this is a 'School Management System', such attacks could compromise sensitive student data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into fields or data that get stored in the application database, potentially via user input fields.",
    "When other users access the stored malicious data, the scripts will execute in their browsers."
