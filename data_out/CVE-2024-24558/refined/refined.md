Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `@tanstack/react-query-next-experimental` package's improper handling of untrusted input during server-side rendering of HTML pages. Specifically, it did not properly escape characters when serializing the cache data into a script tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is an XSS issue. The package was vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the rendered HTML by manipulating the data being serialized and injected into the page during server-side rendering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By injecting malicious input or arranging for malicious input to be returned from an endpoint, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to a variety of attacks including data theft, session hijacking, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (as stated in the CVSS metrics). The attacker must be able to control or inject malicious data that will be serialized and inserted into the HTML as part of the server-side rendered output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to either inject malicious input or control an endpoint that returns malicious data that is then processed by the affected package. No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions >=5.0.0 of `@tanstack/react-query-next-experimental`.
- The fix involves implementing proper escaping of the data before inserting into the HTML.
- The specific fix introduced an `htmlEscapeJsonString` function which escapes the characters `"&"`, `">"`, `<`, `"\u2028"`, and `"\u2029"`.
- The issue was identified by `phryneas` and the fix was co-authored by `TkDodo` and `Lenz Weber-Tronic`.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).

In summary, the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform XSS by injecting malicious content through the `react-query-next-experimental` library's server-side rendering process.
