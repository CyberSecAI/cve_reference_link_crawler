  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP web server ‘boa’ is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows due to unsafe copies of some overly long parameters submitted in the form, specifically when handling parameters like 'submit-url', 'ifname', 'hostname', and 'peerPin'. The underlying issue is insufficient validation of the received buffer and unsafe calls to sprintf/strcpy.",

      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation",

    "impact": "Successful exploitation can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks by crafting specific HTTP requests with overly long or invalid arguments in form parameters.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can be on the network and send a crafted request to the vulnerable service."
