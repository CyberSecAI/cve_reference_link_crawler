Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-24762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure cross-origin communication in the `sysend.js` library. The library allowed any domain to listen to messages sent through its proxy iframe, potentially leaking sensitive user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Cross-Origin Communication:** The library's cross-domain communication mechanism did not properly restrict which domains could receive messages, allowing any website to potentially intercept sensitive data transmitted using `sysend`.
- **Lack of Domain Restriction:**  Prior to the fix, the `sysend.proxy()` function did not enforce any restrictions on which domains were allowed to communicate, meaning any domain could create an iframe and listen to messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could embed an iframe using a malicious domain and listen to messages sent through `sysend`, potentially intercepting and extracting sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not explicitly stated, this could be a potential attack vector if an attacker can inject malicious code (iframe with the proxy) into a vulnerable page.
- **Iframe Embedding:** An attacker could embed an iframe pointing to the `sysend` proxy on a malicious website. This iframe can listen for messages using `window.addEventListener('message')`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a website/iframe:** The attacker needs to host a website and include an iframe that points to a page that utilizes `sysend.js` in a vulnerable way.
- **Same Browser:** The attack is limited to the same browser as the communication happens between windows in the same browser environment.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as having "moderate" severity because it only occurs within the same browser.
- The fix implemented in version 1.10.0 introduces the `sysend.channel()` function, which allows developers to restrict the domains that can participate in cross-origin communication. This method limits the potential attack surface.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates the vulnerability, where an attacker can use `sysend.proxy()` on a malicious page to intercept messages from another page using sysend.
```javascript
sysend.proxy('http://jcubic.pl');
window.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
  console.log(e);
});
```

- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `a24f4b776fb18191ae0f7e3d90c2c7bec459431a` which introduced the `channel` function.
```javascript
sysend.channel();
```
- Developers are advised not to send sensitive information using cross-domain communication with `sysend` prior to the patch.
