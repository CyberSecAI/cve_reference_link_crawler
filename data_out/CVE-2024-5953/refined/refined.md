    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability was found in the 389-ds-base LDAP server. This issue may allow an authenticated user to cause a server denial of service while attempting to log in with a user with a malformed hash in their password.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a malformed userPassword hash. When an authenticated user attempts to log in with a user account that has a malformed hash, it can trigger a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Malformed userPassword hash leading to a buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The server may crash or hang.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user attempting to log in with a user account that has a malformed hash in the userPassword attribute.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a valid user account and the ability to modify the password hash of the account to a malformed state. By default, only administrators can directly set a hashed password, but this can be enabled for regular users using the 'nsslapd-allow-hashed-passwords' configuration parameter."
