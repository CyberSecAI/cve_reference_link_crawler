| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2292104#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-06-13 04:22:32 UTC  ``` A denial of service vulnerability was found in 389-ds-base ldap server. This issue may allow an authenticated user to cause a server crash or hang while authenticating with an user having a malformed userPassword. By default only the administrator may directly add hashed password that can trigger the issue. But if nsslapd-allow-hashed-passwords config parameter is turned on, any user can trigger the issue.   The problem is triggered by adding a password to an user using the hashed format (with a hash value too long for the specified hash scheme) Then later on when trying to authenticate on that user its triggers the buffer overflow  By default, only  administrators are allowed to add hashed passwords but there is a configuration parameter (nsslapd-allow-hashed-passwords) allowing any users to add hashed passwords and potentially trigger the DoS.   This vulnerability affects versions: >= 1.3.7.2   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2292104#c1)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-06-13 04:25:53 UTC  ``` Created 389-ds-base tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2292109](show_bug.cgi?id=2292109 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-5953 389-ds-base: Malformed userPassword hash may cause Denial of Service [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2292104#c6)  Jamie Chapman    2024-07-17 15:41:17 UTC  ``` Hi Patrick,  Can you create a clone of this ticket for a directory_server_12.4 z stream build.
