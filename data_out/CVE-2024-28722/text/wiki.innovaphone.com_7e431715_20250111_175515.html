This is the Firmware 14r1 Release Notes Document.

Service Releases are planned for the second Monday each month. For each of the service release, the complete set of tests is executed. If problems show up during the tests, the problems are fixed. This may cause a delay. The tests are started early, so that some delay is covered, but it still may happen that the patchday has to be moved. In this case it is hard to predict when the service release is good. It may be any day, so it would not be good to move the patchday by a fixed number of days, it still should be released as early as possible.

# Firmware 14r1

## 14r1 Service Release 1 (1410485)

### 159317 - Advanced UI: Prevent XSL injection

The servlets for the advanced UI accept an "xsl" URL paramter that

specifies the XSLT file for displaying the corresponding page.

Before
this fix it was possible to specify a URL containing a colon represented in XML entity encoding.

​

CVE-2024-28722

### 159392 - App Devices: exclude category name was missing after editing device configuration in UI

If a device configuration was added/edited and directly edited again (without closing Devices), the exclude category name was missing inside the input field.

### 159398 - App Devices: fixed missing certificates if more than one certificate configuration exists

More than one certificate configuration in a Devices instance with the same certificates in the list caused missing certificates due to a wrong UNIQUE database index.

### 160325 - App Devices: ignore port in hostname comparison for sysclient connections

If a client connects to the Devices App, the client host name is compared against the host name of the Devices App URL.

​Here one side contained the port so the comparison failed and a new URL was wrongly configured on the sysclient.

### 159389 - App Devices: show prominent success hint on domain/project link

### 159321 - App Platform Manager: allow to continue App Platform update if settings are closed during update

or if the websocket connections is closed or the browser etc.

### 159262 - App Platform Manager: fixed leak on wrong statistics live update usage

If a live update was requested multiple times without stopping it before, a leak occurred.

### 153571 - App Recordings: Avoid unnecessary object info retrievals

### 159763 - App Store: Check for new available versions not returning the greatest build

On Firmware and Software the check for available new versions on a source store was only checking the first entry of the array on the JSON but the greatest build is not always on the first entry of the array.

### 159791 - App Store: Display app title on the source store selection menu

Instead the ID, the title should be displayed for the apps and software. The user cannot always find the app looking for the ID.

### 159294 - App Store: Error on decoding apps.json if DB is empty

If apps.json is empty or includes just "{}" an error was show that the file could not be decoded, but the file content should still be valid and just no apps will be uploaded.

### 159762 - App Store: Firmware, software and app platform selection on source store empty after reopening the app

Unlike the apps, the selection of firmware, software and app platform is not retained.

### 159308 - App Switchboard: Calls from the WQ that where alerting before the app started may not be displayed on the UI

If the CallInfo "update" message was received with state 132, the call was not added to the WQs calls list.

### 147575 - App UsersAdmin: Allow to set DN when adding a new user

### 159540 - App UsersAdmin: Do not allow to click on the buttons without login

### 160055 - App Voicemail: CFx is not displayed in the app and cannot be deleted by app

### 159542 - App Voicemail: No country information for phone lookup is send

### 159264 - App Working Manager: Add search field to filter the users' list

This allows to find the target user without scrolling the list.

### 159687 - App Working: Clicking on the start button very fast added many working intervals without stop time

The read latest query checked only the timestamp but on the same minute the timestamp is the same, so the returned entry could not be the latest one. Now also the ID is checked.

### 159670 - App Working: Do not allow to submit vacation day after the working hours have beed submitted

The submit button on the absences section should only be available for "Sick leave", "1/2 vacation day", when there are not working hours or when working on vacation is allowed.

​Otherwise if the user could submit the working hours first and mark it as vacation day afterwards.

### 159263 - App Working: It was possible to submit > 10 hours per day

On the unsubmitted dialog it was possible to submit more than 10 hours per day because the total worked hours per day was only counting the already submitted hours.

### 160634 - Contact Widgets: Fix for call hold

Call got lost (released) when called agent put the call on hold.

### 160088 - Contact Widgets: Fix for master/standby-environments

In environments with master/standby PBX the widgets app service could loose connection.

After an upgrade  to 14r1final

from  13r3 or an older version the assignment of values stored in "DHCP /

```
/offer" config to DHCP option values sent by server was wrong.

```
### 160383 - Dialpad can now also be used to send DTMF

While there is an active connected call the Dialpad transcends into DTMF mode.

### 159320 - Firmware Let's Encrypt: fixed DNS names limitation

The total length of all DNS names was limited to 1024, which was wrong.

### 159606 - innovaphone myApps Connector for Microsoft 365: Master Pbx Connection is displayed wrong

PDFs were not displayed in the Fax App. Chromium requests to load some new extensions and resource files.

### 180038 - myApps for Windows: Restarting/Reconnecting the Sennheiser/EPOS SDK for a more reliable use

The myApps client connects to the Sennheiser/EPOS SDK. If the SDK process has not yet started or is terminated in the meantime, the client attempts to restart the process. If the connection is lost, the client attempts to reconnect. The use of the SDK should therefore be more stable and the Sennheiser (EPOS) devices can be used more reliably.
### 179994 - myApps for Windows: Yealink or Jabra devices wrongly recognized as active device

Yealink or Jabra may be wrongly selected as an active device instead of the correct one. This was a timing issue due to a detection of a new Jabra or Yealink device in the system while looking for a Sennheiser or Plantronics device. This is fixed now.

### 180967 - myApps Plugin for Windows: innovaphoneRemoteServices folder must be created in the registry under HKLM

### 181517 - PBX API GetNodes: Same 'more' mechanism as for other requests

The request returns the 'more' property when the limit of the number of elements for the response is reached. The property can be used to read more items in the next request.

### 181525 - PBX SOAP/RCC: UserCall was tried on registration with NO-MEDIA-CALLS

Creating user calls with the SOAP command 'UserCall' should not be tried to registrations with the flag 'no media-calls'. Such registrations can only be used for chats, for example, and calls to them fail right away. This is now fixed.

### 181406 - PBX: Pickup to busy endpoint did not work in case of twin-phone config

A pickup call to a busy endpoint should work and other restrictions, such as for a call from the same user or transfering from the same user, should not apply.
The problem happened in a switchboard szenario.
### 181526 - PBX: Potential unexpected restart on mode changing of the PBX

There could be an unexpected restart if the mode of the PBX is changed, for example from standby to off. This is now fixed.

### 181491 - PBX: Split PbxApi request 'GetPseudoObjects' answer (potential buffer overrun trap)

If there are a large number of pseudo objects in the PBX, a buffer overflow trap may occur with this PbxApi request. The response is now split. A maximum of 50 objects are returned. The 'more' argument must be used to obtain further objects. The trap is now prevented.

The displays of the initialization steps of the calendar admin have been updated and now show the newly added steps correctly.

### 182960 - App Calendar: Existing and unchanged executive objects not syncronized

The Calendar did not synchronize PBX 'Executive' objects. This was fixed in "#180867 - App Calendar: PBX 'Executive' objects not supported". However, on existing installations, that fix only synchronized 'Executive' objects that were added or changed after that fix. This is now changed so that all 'Executive' objects are included without the need of resetting the synchronization system or changing the objects.

### 182957 - App Calendar: No synchronisation of new PBX users with Exchange

When a new user is created in Exchange and the PBX, the Calendar may not find the Exchange user due to a timing problem. The Calendar will now check any user not found in Exchange four times within 20 minutes before removing them from the sync system. In addition, a user can now be manually reset and resynchronized via Calendar Admin.

### 182376 - App Calendar: Old Exchange Subscription IDs not released after calendar restart

When the Calendar is restarted, old subscription IDs from Exchange are not released. This can lead to an error when subscribing users for Exchange appointment updates. If the Calendar is stoppend and restarted (or the connection to Exchange is lost and re-established), the previous subscription IDs are now removed.
### 182375 - App Calendar: Requesting a reset in Calendar Admin will note reset the PBX related user data

If clicking on Reset in the Calendar admin, only the Exchange Sync-related data is deleted, but not the replicated PBX user data. For this reason, some changed PBX user can not been reset. This is fixed now.

### 183978 - App Calendar: Sorting order of appointments sometimes wrong

When two (or more) appointments start at the same time but have different duration values, the longer one will be shown as active first instead of the one which ends first.

### 181991 - App Fax/SDK SMTP client: Sending multiple mails if the connection is terminated by the remote peer

Once the e-mail has been sent successfully, the SMTP client expects to close the connection itself. If the connection is closed by the remote peer, the sending process is incorrectly reported as failed and the application sends the e-mail again. This is fixed now.
### 183648 - App Reporting: Email report scheduling problem at midnight

If the sending time for an email report is set to near midnight, the report may be sent a day earlier or later than planned, depending on the time zone. This is fixed now.

### 182744 - App Voicemail: More than 200 nodes (PBX Manager Plugin)

There is a limit of 200 nodes received from the PBX in the PBX Manager Plugin for this app. Now all are shown.

### 183426 - IP-DECT: Checking mandatory arguments for the logout command

The mandatory arguments for the user logout command are now checked to prevent traps.

### 184213 - IPxx13: Support NVME Version 1.4

The IPxx13 currently only supports M.2 SSDs with NVME specification version 1.3. With this fix the NVME specification version 1.4 is supported. The specification is found here: <https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM-Express-1_4a-2020.03.09-Ratified.pdf>

### 183522 - myApps Windows: fixed potential crash on Office Integration usage

### 184145 - Phone USB headset: Yealink UH34 failed to connect

Different to the headset firmware previously tested by the manufacturer, reading the HID report descriptors fails with the currently delivered firmware. As these descriptors are only required for development, reading is now skipped.
### 182813 - Phones: Failed lookup in LDAP with empty dialing location

If an empty dialing location is configured, the LDAP phone number lookup for incoming calls does not work. This is fixed now.
### 183191 - SIP: No switch to secondary proxy

SIP signaling does not switch to secondary proxy if primary proxy fails (no response). This only happens if two hostnames are configured (no SRV query). This is fixed now.

### 183995 - Update of \*.innovaphone.com certificate in trust list of devices

The old \*.innovaphone.com certificate expires on 29.12.2024.This software update installs the new \*.innovaphone.com certificate to the trust list of all devices.

  is automatically available with existing app platforms or after adding a new
  one in the PBX Manager.
* It offers
  the view to the App Platform Manager‘s App Store with all the available
  functionalities and allows to install, update and uninstall apps. Therefore it is using the new App Platform Manager UI.
* When an
  app is installed, a default instance is implicitly added with the associated
  domain and then started. This facilitates the configuration of the instance
  through its respective PBX Manager plugin.

### 158168 - App notifications and Web Push

### 155105 - myApps Plugin for Virtual Desktops

A softphone running at a terminal server (Citrix, Windows, ...) has the problem that audio and video streams start and terminate at the server.

It means media received at the terminal server must be transmitted to the local client for playback and media delivered by audio or webcams devices must be transmitted to the terminal server for transmission to the remote peer.

This media transmission between server and local client adds a delay in the media stream which complicates the communication.

The myApps Plugin provides a solution for this problem offloading the media data and the management of the audio and video devices to the local client.

enable on the myApps client for Windows but not on
your smartphone. If the setting is enabled, when the myApps
session starts a new start time is added
to the database and when the session is closed a stop time is
also added.
This time can always be edited afterwards on the Working User App. The new
