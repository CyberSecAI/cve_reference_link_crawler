{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-28722",
  "date": "2024-12-05",
  "description": "The servlets for the advanced UI accept an \"xsl\" URL parameter that specifies the XSLT file for displaying the corresponding page. Before this fix it was possible to specify a URL containing a colon represented in XML entity encoding.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the 'xsl' URL parameter, before using it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XSL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially inject malicious XSL code, which could lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches within the application. An attacker could also potentially use this to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted URL with XSL parameter containing XML entity encoded colon."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the targeted web application."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability is mitigated by sanitizing the `xsl` URL parameter and preventing the usage of URLs containing colons that have been XML entity encoded."
  ]
