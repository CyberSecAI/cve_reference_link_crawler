- Malicious JavaScript code is inserted into the "subject" field.
- When the page listing tickets is loaded, the stored XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to log in to the application as a user that has the ability to create or edit tickets.
- No special privileges are needed other than the ability to interact with the ticket system.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept payload is: `<dt/><b/><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`

**Additional Notes**
