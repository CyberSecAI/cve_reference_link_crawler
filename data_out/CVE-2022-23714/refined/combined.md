# Kibana cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue (ESA-2022-08)

A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the Vega Charts Kibana integration which could allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in a victim’s browser.

## Affected Versions:

Versions 7.0.0 through 7.17.4 and 8.0.0 through 8.2.3

## Solutions and Mitigations:

The issue is fixed in versions 8.3.0 and 7.17.5.

If you are unable to upgrade, you can select to disable Vega visualizations :

* For on premise installations, you can set `vis_type_vega.enabled: false` (or `vega.enabled: false` for Kibana versions older than 7.7.0) in `kibana.yml` file.
* For Elastic Cloud services deployments, you can reach out to Elastic Support

**CVSSv3:**

6.4 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23713

# Endpoint Security Local Privilege Escalation issue (ESA-2022-09)

A local privilege escalation (LPE) issue was discovered in the ransomware canaries features of Elastic Endpoint Security for Windows, which could allow unprivileged users to elevate their privileges to those of the LocalSystem account.

## Affected Versions:

Versions 7.13.0 through 7.17.4 and 8.0.0 through 8.2.3

## Solutions and Mitigations:

An artifact update was distributed to all internet connected endpoints which disables the vulnerable feature ("Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.global.version" version 1.0.324+). However, 7.14+ enterprise and platinum Endpoints remain affected if the cloud update hasn’t been received and ransomware protection is enabled. The cloud update occurs 5 minutes after installation if the update server can be reached.

The vulnerability is resolved in versions 8.3.0 and 7.17.5 where the vulnerable feature is disabled out of the box without requiring the artifact update. A workaround for endpoints unable to update or connect to the artifact update server is to disable the vulnerable feature manually by setting the “windows.advanced.ransomware.canary” advanced policy option to false.

A future version will include a fix for the vulnerability and will re-enable the canaries component of the ransomware protection feature. In the meantime, Elastic Security is confident that its layered approach to protections provides high efficacy against ransomware threats without requiring the canary feature.

**CVSSv3:**

7.0 (High) - AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23714

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
