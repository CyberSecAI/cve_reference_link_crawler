Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `manage_tenant.php` file. The `id` parameter, passed via the GET method, is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly embedded in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to read sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter of a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/index.php?page=manage_tenant`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to have access to a valid session (cookie) after logging into the backend as `mayuri.infospace@gmail.com/rootadmin`.
