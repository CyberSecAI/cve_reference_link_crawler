- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, a missing check for proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token within a function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the function affected but is classified as low severity and unlikely to be exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting a function lacking proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (an unprivileged user) and somehow trigger the vulnerable function.
