Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `index` parameter in the `/view/student_payment_invoice.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System" not being properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (the `index` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially leak sensitive user data or system information by manipulating the SQL queries.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability can lead to broader system compromise, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access or control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `index` parameter in the HTTP request to the `/view/student_payment_invoice.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL is necessary to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is `index`.
*   The vulnerable file is `/view/student_payment_invoice.php`.
*   The provided payload `index='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(4)))v)%2B'` demonstrates a time-based SQL injection attempt, using the `sleep(4)` function to cause a delay, which would indicate that the injection is successful.

This information is more detailed than a placeholder CVE description would provide, highlighting the specific file, parameter, and SQL payload used in the exploitation.
