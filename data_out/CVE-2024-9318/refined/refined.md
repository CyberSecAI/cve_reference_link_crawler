Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `id` parameter in the `activate.php` file is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Error-based SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data extraction (e.g., usernames, passwords, database structure).
  - Data manipulation (e.g., adding, modifying, deleting data).
  - Full database compromise.
  - Potential privilege escalation depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted GET request to the `activate.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific position is mentioned other than the ability to make HTTP requests.
- The attacker should have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `activate.php` file.
- The SQL injection is error-based, meaning the attacker relies on database error messages to extract information.
- The provided payload shows the use of `extractvalue()` function to trigger the injection:
    `GET /control/activate.php?id=1+AND+extractvalue%281%2Cconcat%28%27~%27%2C%28select+user%28%29%29%29%29 HTTP/1.1`
- The vulnerable code directly concatenates the `id` parameter into the SQL query as shown in the provided screenshot.

This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially gain full access to the underlying database.
