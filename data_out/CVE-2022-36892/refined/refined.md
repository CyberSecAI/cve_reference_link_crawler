    {
      "vulnerability": "CVE-2022-36892",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The rhnpush-plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Missing permission check"
        ],
        "impact": "Attackers with Item/Read permission can check whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list workspace contents.",
        "attack_vectors": "By sending crafted requests to the form validation method of the plugin.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attackers need Item/Read permission but not Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permissions."
      }
