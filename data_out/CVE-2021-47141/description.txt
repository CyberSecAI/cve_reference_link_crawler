In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: Add NULL pointer checks when freeing irqs.

When freeing notification blocks, we index priv->msix_vectors.
If we failed to allocate priv->msix_vectors (see abort_with_msix_vectors)
this could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the driver is unloaded.
