The provided content relates to the following CVE: CVE-2021-47141.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `gve_free_notify_blocks` function of the `gve` driver. This occurs when the driver fails to allocate `priv->msix_vectors` during initialization, but attempts to access it during the freeing of notification blocks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access `priv->msix_vectors` without verifying that it is not NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A NULL pointer dereference leading to a kernel crash/denial of service when unloading the driver.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a condition where the driver fails to allocate `priv->msix_vectors`.
- Then unloading the driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to trigger the driver loading and unloading process.
- The attacker must be able to induce a failure in allocating `priv->msix_vectors`.
