- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An endpoint in Zammad 6.2.x accepts a generic method name without proper sanitization against an allowlist.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The lack of input validation on method names allows arbitrary method calls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated agent can perform a remote Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the Zammad system.
- **Attack vectors**: By calling a specific endpoint and providing a method name that's not on an allowlist.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated agent account within the Zammad system.
