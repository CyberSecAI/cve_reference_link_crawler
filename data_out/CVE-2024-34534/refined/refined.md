The provided content is related to CVE-2024-34534.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `check_model` method of the `ir.model` model within the Text Commander module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation and sanitization in the `check_model` method, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
- Direct use of the database cursor without access rights checking or prepared statements.
- Public method accessible through the External API

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation (demonstrated by changing the admin password)
- Information disclosure
- Data tampering

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted XML-RPC request to the `ir.model` model through the External API, triggering the vulnerable `check_model` method.
- The `data` parameter of the method is used to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A portal user or internal user of an Odoo instance with the `text_commander` module installed.
- Access to the External API to send requests to the vulnerable method.
