## Find out why our customers keep coming back.

What real users are saying about Automation Anywhere vs. UiPath.

I’ve used UiPath as a developer. Now, I’m using Automation Anywhere as well. When I compare both, the biggest point is cognitive abilities. The Document Automation is the best in class. You won’t find that even in UiPath.

What real users are saying about Automation Anywhere vs. Microsoft Power Automate.

We also explored Microsoft’s Power Automate. However, it wasn’t as mature or up to an enterprise level at the time. Automation Anywhere had good standards and excellent support, in terms of architecture, design, and user interface, we chose Automation Anywhere. It also has good community support.

What real users are saying about Automation Anywhere vs. Blue Prism.

We had to switch to Automation Anywhere due to the high initial license fee associated with Blue Prism. Automation Anywhere is more cost-effective.

What real users are saying about Automation Anywhere vs. alternative solutions.

Before using Automation Anywhere I checked Blue Prism & Ui Path but I preferred Automation Anywhere because it is best in quality. It also has Document Automation for unstructured data converting in structure.
