**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `delete_faculty.php` file in the Kashipara College Management System is vulnerable to XSS injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `delete_faculty.php`.

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** XSS can lead to more severe consequences such as stealing session cookies, performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `id` parameter. For example:
    `delete_faculty.php?id=1'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9171)</ScRiPt>`
