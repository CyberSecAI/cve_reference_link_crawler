The provided content is related to CVE-2024-2332.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter within the `manage_category.php` file. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `$_GET['id']` parameter into an SQL query without any form of validation or sanitization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection as it allows injection of SQL commands through the `id` parameter, which is then directly used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive Data Exposure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers could modify data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
- Full system compromise: Successful injection can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request, by manipulating the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability as the vulnerable script is accessible without any login.
