- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software fails to properly validate input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker must have local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) such as opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no special privileges (PR:N), but requires the user to interact with a malicious file.
