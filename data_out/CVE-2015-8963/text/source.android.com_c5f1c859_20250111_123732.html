# Android Security Bulletin—November 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published November 07, 2016 | Updated December 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of November 06, 2016 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the
[Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on October 20,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as
[SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* With the introduction of the Pixel and Pixel XL devices, the term for
  [all devices supported by Google](#google-devices) is
  "Google devices" instead of "Nexus devices."
* This bulletin has three security patch levels to provide Android partners
  with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are
  similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-11-01**: Partial security patch level. This security
    patch level indicates that all issues associated with 2016-11-01 (and all
    previous security patch level) are addressed.
  + **2016-11-05**: Complete security patch level. This security
    patch level indicates that all issues associated with 2016-11-01 and 2016-11-05
    (and all previous security patch levels) are addressed.
  + **Supplemental security patch levels**

    Supplemental security patch levels are provided to identify devices
    that contain fixes for issues that were publicly disclosed after the
    patch level was defined. Addressing these recently disclosed
    vulnerabilities is not required until the 2016-12-01 security patch level.

    - **2016-11-06**: This security patch level indicates that the
      device has addressed all issues associated with 2016-11-05 and CVE-2016-5195,
      which was publicly disclosed on October 19, 2016.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the November
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.
