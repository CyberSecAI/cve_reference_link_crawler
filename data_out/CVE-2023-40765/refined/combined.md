Today, I want to follow up the previous post ([https://medium.com/@mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e](/%40mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e)) about some additional vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* CVE-2023–40748
* CVE-2023–40749
* CVE-2023–40750
* CVE-2023–40751
* CVE-2023–40752
* CVE-2023–40753
* CVE-2023–40754
* CVE-2023–40755
* CVE-2023–40756
* CVE-2023–40757
* CVE-2023–40758
* CVE-2023–40759
* CVE-2023–40760
* CVE-2023–40761
* CVE-2023–40762
* CVE-2023–40763
* CVE-2023–40764
* CVE-2023–40765
* CVE-2023–40766
* CVE-2023–40767

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:

## Testimonials

Let our clients share their experience with our online event booking system and how the script has improved their online business.

“

I purchased the event booking system (at an extremely reasonable price) with very little knowledge of Joomla1.5. It was customized for me very quickly and the instructions for installation were clear and concise. A small fix was necessary and the customer service operation headed by Alexander 'Sasho' Valkanov came through for me in (believe it or not) minutes. I highly recommend PHPjabbers.com.

“

Just a quick note to tell you, guys, what a great experience I had with PHPJabbers. I was looking to develop a simple calendar and event booking application for a professional development training business. I found PHPJabbers event calendar script on phpjabbers.com but realized that what I wanted would require a substantial amount of modification. Also, I wanted it to work as a Joomla component. I requested a quote from PHPJabbers, got a very reasonable estimate, and agreed to go ahead. PHPJabbers team worked quickly and were in constant contact, and once the product was delivered kept working until I was completely satisfied.

“

We purchased some of PHPJabbers calendar and booking scripts for various customers. I would just like to say how impressed we were with your scripts, your price, your speed and ability to adapt them to our requirements.

The main thing is that your charges were both reasonable and affordable even for a small family firm like ours. The lack of expensive charges did not affect the service you gave us, with the prompt delivery of amended scripts and super fast service through your PHPJabbers support system and this was over Christmas and the new year holiday period.

The second thing is the ease of use. Even my 90 year old grandmother succeeded both viewing and admin side straight off.

We would recommend phpjabbers.com to anyone wanting any type of online diary or booking system.

Thanks again.
