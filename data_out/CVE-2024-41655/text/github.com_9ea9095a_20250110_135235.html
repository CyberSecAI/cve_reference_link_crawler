# (ReDoS) Regular Expression Denial of Service in tf2-item-format

High

[danocmx](/danocmx)
published
GHSA-8h55-q5qq-p685
Jul 23, 2024

## Package

npm

tf2-item-format
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<5.9.14

## Patched versions

5.9.14

## Description

## Summary

Versions of `tf2-item-format` since at least `4.2.6` are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack when parsing crafted user input.

## Tested Versions

* `5.9.13`
* `5.8.10`
* `5.7.0`
* `5.6.17`
* `4.3.5`
* `4.2.6`

## Mitigation

### v5

Upgrade package to `^5.9.14`

### v4

No patch exists. Please consult the [v4 to v5 migration guide](https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format?tab=readme-ov-file#migrating-from-v4-to-v5) to upgrade to v5.

If upgrading to v5 is not possible, fork the module repository and implement the fix detailed below.

## Details

> All mentions of source code are based on the `5.9.13` version of the package.

The error originates from `src/shared/decomposeName.ts` Lines 54-57:

```
itemName = itemName.replace(
  new RegExp(`(( ${toRemove})|(${toRemove} ))`),
  ''
);
```

since both `itemName` and `toRemove` originate from user input, this can be exploited to perform a ReDoS attack.

This ReGeX is only called under the following conditions:

* `attributes.usableItem` is truthy
* either `attributes.usableItem.output` or `attributes.usableItem.target` are falsy

under these conditions, `itemName` is is unmodified from user input, and `toRemove` is created by the `getUsableItemToRemove()` function, which can return one of three possible strings:

* `"{attributes.usableItem.target}"`
* `"{attributes.usableItem.target.output}"`
* `"{attributes.usableItem.outputQuality} {usableItem.output}"`

`decomposeName()` is used on two API functions: `parseString()` (`src/parseString.ts`) and `ParsedEcon.itemName.getShort()` (`src/parseEconItem/ParsedEcon/ItemName.ts`). Since the latter typically only handles input from Steam, it was not investigated as a potential attack vector.

When `parseString()` is called, the `attributes` object is created from the constructor of the `Attributes` class, where the `usableItem` field is populated by `getUsableItem()` (`src/parseString/Attributes/getUsableItem.ts`).

Since malicious payloads need to ensure either `attributes.usableItem.output` or `attributes.usableItem.target` are falsy, either `isChemistrySet()` or `getItemIfTarget()` must not return a falsy value. Since the `getItemIfTarget()` was easier to exploit, it was used in the PoC. It is highly possible that `isChemistrySet()` is also vulnerable to a similar attack.

> `src/parseString/Attributes/getUsableItem.ts` Lines 34-45

```
const item = getItemIfTarget(name);
if (item) {
  return {
    target: name
      .replace(` ${item}`, '')
      .replace(`${getKillstreak(name)} `, '')
      // Incase its uncraftable
      .replace('Non-Craftable ', '')
      // For Unusualifiers
      .replace('Unusual ', ''),
  };
}
```

Here, `name` is unmodifed user input.

If an input of form `"<anything> Kit"` is passed to `getItemIfTarget()`, the function will return `"Kit"`, which will result in `attributes.usableItem.target` being set to `"<anything>"` and `attributes.usableItem.output` being `undefined`.

Now, since `attributes.usableItem.target` is defined, `getUsableItemToRemove()` will return `"<anything>"`, setting `toRemove` to `"<anything>"`.

In short, due to the above, a payload of form `"<anything> Kit"` cause a Regex of form

`/(( <anything>)|(<anything> ))/` to be created and executed on `"<anything> Kit"`.

This exposes the possibility of ReDoS through catastrophic backtracking.

If `<anything>` is set a specially crafted payload, the Regex will take an exponential amount of time to execute, causing the server to hang.

For the PoC, the payload `)|^.{23}(a+)+$| Kit |( aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZ`

was used.

* `)|` is used to isolate the malicious pattern
* `^.{23}` causes the malicious pattern to ignore itself and `"Kit"`
* `(a+)+$` This is a malicious Regex pattern that will cause catastrophic backtracking upon encountering a string of form `aaa...aaaZ`
* `|` is used to isolate the malicious pattern
* `Kit` is used to ensure this payload is converted to Regex as shown above.
* `|(` is used to avoid causing a Regex syntax error.
* a space is used to make sure the `aaa...aaaZ` cannot match itself, as this create a group.
* `aaa...aaaZ` is used to trigger the catastrophic backtracking.

## PoC

### v4

```
const { parseString } = require( "tf2-item-format");
const payload = ")|^.{23}(a+)+$| Kit |( aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZ";
parseString(payload , true, true);
```
### v5

```
const { parseString } = require( "tf2-item-format/static");
const payload = ")|^.{23}(a+)+$| Kit |( aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaZ";
parseString(payload , true, true);
```
## Remediation

> In `src/shared/decomposeName.ts` Lines 54-57:

```
itemName = itemName.replace(
  new RegExp(`(( ${toRemove})|(${toRemove} ))`),
  ''
);
```

should be updated to

```
itemName = itemName.replace(`${toRemove} `, '');
itemName = itemName.replace(` ${toRemove}`, '');
```
## Impact

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to perform DoS attacks on any service that uses any `tf2-item-format` to parse user input.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
