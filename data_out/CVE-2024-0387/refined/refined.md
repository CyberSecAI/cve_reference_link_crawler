The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0387.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Moxa EDS-4000/G4000 Series devices have IP forwarding capabilities that cannot be disabled by users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy') (CWE-441). The devices forward requests, potentially masking the original source, and bypassing access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass access controls.
- An attacker can hide the source of malicious requests.
- The device can be used as an intermediary to send requests to a target.
-  Possible compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of affected devices and target systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending requests to the vulnerable device, which then forwards the requests to another target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have adjacent network access (AV:A) to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to send a request to the device.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send requests to the device.
