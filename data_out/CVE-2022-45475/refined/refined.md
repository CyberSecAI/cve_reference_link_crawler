Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-45475:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   It processes uploaded files server-side instead of just returning them for download.
*   It allows unauthenticated users to access uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.
*   **Unrestricted file upload and processing:** The application processes uploaded files server-side, which can lead to vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
*   **Unauthenticated access to uploaded files:**  Uploaded files are accessible to unauthenticated users, which can be a security risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely on the server by uploading a malicious PHP file and accessing it.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker exploits the CSRF vulnerability to trick a legitimate user (preferably an admin) into uploading a malicious PHP file.
*   The attacker then accesses the uploaded malicious file directly to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that appears to come from a legitimate user with upload privileges, usually an admin.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit involves uploading a PHP file that contains a command execution function.
*   The provided example `exploit.php` file accepts a `cmd` parameter which is then executed using the `system()` function, if the password is correct.
*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability is addressed in Tiny File Manager version 2.5.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks.
*   The advisory mentions that CVE-2022-23044 and CVE-2022-45476 are also related to this issue.
