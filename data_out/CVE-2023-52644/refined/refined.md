{
  "CVE-2023-52644": {
    "Description": "The provided data reveals a vulnerability in the Broadcom b43 Wi-Fi driver within the Linux kernel related to Quality of Service (QoS) handling. When QoS is disabled, the driver incorrectly attempts to stop/wake a non-existent queue, leading to warnings and potential issues.",
    "Root cause": "When QoS is disabled, the queue priority value is not mapped correctly to the IEEE 802.11 queue as there's only one queue, leading to an attempt to stop/wake a non-existent queue.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect queue management when QoS is disabled."
    ],
    "Impact": "The incorrect queue management leads to kernel warnings and may cause instability or unexpected behavior within the b43 driver, potentially disrupting wireless network operations.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "This vulnerability is triggered by the driver's internal logic when QoS is disabled. An attacker may be able to trigger the vulnerability by disabling QoS on the wireless connection"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker would need to be in a position where they can interact with the system in such a way as to trigger the driver code where qos is disabled, for example being able to configure the wifi interface",
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The fix involves introducing inline functions `b43_wake_queue` and `b43_stop_queue` that explicitly stop/wake queue 0 when QoS is disabled, preventing the driver from trying to manipulate incorrect queue indexes, which is an improvement from the original CVE description."
