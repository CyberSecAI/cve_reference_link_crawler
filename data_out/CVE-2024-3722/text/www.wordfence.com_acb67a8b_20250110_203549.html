### Description

The Swift Performance Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the ajax\_handler() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.6.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve and modify settings.
