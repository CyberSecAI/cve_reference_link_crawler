Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3722

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `ajax_handler()` function in the Swift Performance Lite plugin lacks a proper capability check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the missing capability check in the `ajax_handler()` function. This function handles AJAX requests for various settings modifications.
- **Missing Capability Check:** The code does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions (e.g., `manage_options`) to perform the requested actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Settings Modification:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the plugin's settings.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability also allows an attacker to retrieve plugin settings.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not a direct privilege escalation, it allows lower-level users to change settings that should only be accessible to administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network (HTTP/HTTPS) as it involves sending AJAX requests to a WordPress endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:**  An attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site with subscriber level access or above.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site, with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.
- **Knowledge of the Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to know how to trigger the `ajax_handler()` with the appropriate parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The Wordfence article clarifies that the issue is in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.3.6.18. The fix is in version 2.3.6.19.
- The vulnerable code is within the `ajax_handler` function.

In summary, the vulnerability allows low-privileged authenticated users to modify and read settings through AJAX calls because the plugin lacks authorization checks, allowing them to potentially disrupt site functionality or gain access to sensitive data.
