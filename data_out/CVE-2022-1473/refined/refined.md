Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` function in OpenSSL 3.0, which is used to empty hash tables, has a bug that prevents the reuse of memory occupied by removed hash table entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:**  The improper memory management within `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` leads to a memory leak. Each time certificates or keys are decoded, memory is allocated but not properly freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Over time, the memory leak will cause the process's memory usage to expand without bounds. Eventually, the operating system may terminate the process due to excessive memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. Additionally, traversing the growing list of empty hash table entries will increase processing time, further impacting performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Decoding certificates or keys. This commonly occurs in long-lived processes such as TLS clients or servers configured to accept client certificate authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker doesn't need a direct network presence. They can trigger the vulnerability by supplying certificates/keys to an affected application, causing the memory leak if the application has the faulty version of OpenSSL and is continuously processing keys or certificates.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to OpenSSL 3.0 and was fixed in version 3.0.3.
-  OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.1.1 are not affected.
- Long-lived processes that decode certificates or keys are most susceptible.
- The vulnerability was reported to OpenSSL on April 21, 2022, by Aliaksei Levin.
