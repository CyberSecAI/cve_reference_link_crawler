- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LearnPress plugin for WordPress versions <= 4.2.3 lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to broken access control. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case, but this is considered a high-severity issue likely to become mass-exploited.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users through a function that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily accessible.
