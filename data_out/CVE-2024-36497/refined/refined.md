Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure storage of the WINSelect administrator password within the application's configuration file. The password is stored in cleartext after the file is decrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unhashed Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability is storing the administrator password in plain text within the decrypted configuration file. This allows anyone with access to the decrypted file to easily obtain the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete Bypass:** An attacker can use the extracted password to disable WINSelect entirely, bypassing all restrictions put in place by the software.
*   **Removal of Restrictions:** With the password, an attacker can remove all existing restrictions imposed by WINSelect, regaining full control of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker, with access to the configuration file, can gain administrative privileges over the WINSelect settings, effectively escalating their privileges within the context of the application's control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the machine where WINSelect is installed. The attacker needs to access the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the machine with read access to the WINSelect configuration file.
*   **File Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WINSelect configuration file, which is located at `C:\ProgramData\WINSelect\WINSelect.wsd` for the standard version and `C:\ProgramData\Faronics\StorageSpace\WS\WINSelect.wsd` for the enterprise version.
*   **Decryption Capabilities:** While not strictly required, the provided exploit script and hardcoded credentials make it trivial to decrypt the file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The configuration file is encrypted using RC4 with a key derived from an MD5 hash of a hardcoded password "Kunal".  The first 5 bytes of the hash are used as the key.
*   A Python script was developed to automate the decryption process.
*   The vendor was informed of the issue and provided a patch that uses PBKDF2 with SHA256 and 600000 iterations for password hashing. However, the hardcoded password used for decryption remains, making the vulnerability exploitable if the configuration file can be accessed.
