Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-0912:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), used to host the Johnson Controls Software House C●CURE 9000 Web Server, improperly logs Microsoft Windows credential details in its logs under certain circumstances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File (CWE-532):** The vulnerability stems from the logging of sensitive credential information into log files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the log files could potentially access credentials used for application access. This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the C●CURE 9000 system, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system and the physical security it manages.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. An attacker would need to have local access to the system where the IIS server is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would require high privileges on the local system hosting the C●CURE 9000 application. The attacker would also need to have the ability to trigger the logging of credentials to the log files. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
- The CISA advisory states that the attacker needs to have a user account with administrative privileges on the C-Cure 9000 server
