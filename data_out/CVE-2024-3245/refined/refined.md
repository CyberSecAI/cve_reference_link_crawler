- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the EmbedPress plugin's Youtube block.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the infected page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the attributes of the Youtube block within the EmbedPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher. They must be able to create or edit pages with the vulnerable Youtube block.
