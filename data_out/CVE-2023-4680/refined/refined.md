The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4680.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Vault transit secrets engine allowed users to specify arbitrary nonces even when convergent encryption was disabled. This was due to a lack of restriction on user-provided nonces during encryption operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Lack of nonce restriction in transit secret engine when convergent encryption is disabled.
-  Potential for nonce reuse with user-provided nonces.
-  Vulnerability in AES-GCM allows for deriving the authentication subkey.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user, authorized to encrypt transit data, could decrypt arbitrary ciphertext using known plaintexts and nonces.
- An authenticated user could derive the authentication subkey when using AES-GCM in non-convergent modes due to flaws in AES-GCM.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `encrypt` endpoint of the transit secrets engine.
- Offline attacks using known plaintexts and nonces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated Vault user with authorization to encrypt transit data via Vault policies.
- Ability to make API requests to the Vault server.
- Ability to perform offline attacks.
