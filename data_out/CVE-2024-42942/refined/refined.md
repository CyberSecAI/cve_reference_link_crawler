The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42942.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `frmL7ImForm` function of Tenda FH1201 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `page` parameter in the `frmL7ImForm` function.
- Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to format a string using the user-supplied `page` parameter without verifying its length, which can exceed the buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack overflow can lead to a denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior if the overflow corrupts critical data or control flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/goform/L7Im` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- No authentication is mentioned as required for the attack.
