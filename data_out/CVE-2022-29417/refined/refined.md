Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the ShortPixel Adaptive Images plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions. This means a user with lower privileges (e.g., a subscriber) can potentially trigger functions or modify settings that should be restricted to administrators or higher-level users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially modify the plugin settings or perform other actions within the plugin that they shouldn't have access to. The specific impact of this could vary depending on what functionality is exposed by the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WordPress plugin itself. An attacker would need to be a registered user on the WordPress website, but they don't need to have administrator privileges. They would exploit the vulnerable function by sending a crafted request to the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, at least as a subscriber. No administrative privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- They would need to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was found by Nguyen Anh Tien and reported through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 4.3
- A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability.
