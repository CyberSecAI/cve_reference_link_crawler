## Description

**An easy-to-use plugin that lets you solve any problems with images and improve your website’s Core Web Vitals in a minute.**

Imagine if you could solve all your website’s image-related problems and increase pagespeed and performance with a simple click, would not that be great?

Usually, images are the biggest resource on a web page. With just one click, ShortPixel Adaptive Images replaces all the pictures on your website with properly sized, smartly-cropped and optimized images and uploads them to ShortPixel’s global CDN.

And for even more Google love, the plugin delivers next-gen WebP or AVIF images to the right browsers auto-magically! 🙂

Using ShortPixel Adaptive Images also helps with [Core Web Vitals (CWV)](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals)‘s Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

This is an important SEO factor that Google uses to rank pages. The smaller the CWV values are, the better for your website.

#### Do I need this plugin?

If you have a WordPress website with images, the answer is most likely yes!

Have you ever tested your website with tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix and received complaints that the images are not the right size or are too big? Or that you should be using “next gen” images like WebP or AVIF? Or that the website should “defer offscreen images”?

ShortPixel Adaptive Images comes to the rescue and solves the problems with images on your website in no time.

In addition to images, CSS, JS and font files are also minimized and delivered from our global CDN.

#### What are the benefits?

#### What are the features?

* new! you can now set your custom domain to serve images or JSS/CSS files, e.g. cdn.example.com. [Read more here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/569-how-to-serve-the-images-from-a-custom-domain).
* new, lightweight, pure JavaScript Adaptive Images Engine (jQuery no longer required)
* same visual quality, but smaller images thanks to ShortPixel algorithms
* smart cropping – [see an example](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/182-what-is-smart-cropping)
* serve only images of appropriate size, depending on the viewport of the visitor
* lazy load support with adjustable threshold; browser native lazy loading support is also available
* automatically serves WebP and AVIF images to browsers that support this format. Animated GIFs are also supported and can will converted to animated WebP and animated AVIF!
* caching and serving from a global CDN for images as well as CSS, JS and fonts
* CSS/JS files are minimized automatically
* all major image galleries, sliders and page builders are supported
* onboarding wizard with a tool that suggests the best settings for each website
* support for low quality image placeholders (LQIP)
* support for JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
* no need for a separate AVIF or WebP converter plugin, the original images are automatically converted to WebP or AVIF
* adjustable size breakpoints when resizing images
* possibility to disable plugin functionality for logged in users
* multiple types of exclusions available, including and advanced Image Checker Tool
* Easy and Advanced mode for settings with a variety of settings for an increased flexibility of the plugin functionality

#### Do I need an account to test this plugin?

No, just install it and activate it on your WordPress website. You will then automatically receive 500 MB of CDN traffic every month. That’s about 500 visits/month!

#### How much does it cost?

When using ShortPixel Adaptive Images, only CDN traffic [is counted](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/460-spai-new-how-are-the-credits-counted) if you choose to use our CDN. With the free plan, you get 100 credits for image optimization, which is equivalent to 500 MB of CDN traffic or about 500 visits/month. Paid plans start at $4.99 and are available as both [one-time](https://shortpixel.com/pricing-one-time) and [monthly](https://shortpixel.com/pricing) plans.

Even better, if you already use [ShortPixel Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/), you can use the same credits for ShortPixel Adaptive Images!

#### How does it work?

Different visitors have different devices (laptop, mobile phone, tablet), each with its own screen resolution. ShortPixel AI takes into account the resolution of the device and then provides the right size image for each placeholder.

Let us take a web page with a single image of 640×480 pixels.

When viewed from a laptop, the image retains its 640×480 pixel size, but is optimized and delivered from our CDN.

When the same web page is viewed from a mobile phone, the image (for example) is resized to 300×225 pixels, optimized, and delivered via our CDN.

In this way, neither time nor bandwidth is wasted for visitors.

### WP CLI commands

Use the following WP CLI commands to clear the CSS cache and the Low Quality Image Placeholders:

wp shortpixel clear\_css

wp shortpixel clear\_lqips

### For developers

If there are main images in the Media Library that end with the usual thumbnail size suffix (e.g. -100×100), please set this in wp-config.php:

```
define('SPAI_FILENAME_RESOLUTION_UNSAFE', true);

```

If you need to do post-processing in JavaScript after the image/tag has been updated by ShortPixel AI, you can add a callback like this:

```
jQuery( document ).ready(function() {
    ShortPixelAI.registerCallback('element-updated', function(elm){
        // elm is the jQuery object, elm[0] is the tag
        console.log("element updated: " + elm.prop('nodeName'));
        });
});

```

To change the original URL of the image that is detected by ShortPixel, use this filter that receives the original URL:

```
add_filter('shortpixel/ai/originalUrl', 'my_function');

```

To return your own custom URL for each language domain for the same website (single plugin installation), use this filter:

add\_filter(‘shortpixel/ai/cdnUrl’, function($cdn\_url) {

switch($\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_HOST’]) { //this is the domain name without protocol

case ‘mydomain.com’: //that’s your main domain

return “https://images.mydomain.com/spai”;

```
    case 'mydomain.fr': //that's your french language domain
        return "https://images.mydomain.fr/spai";

    default:
        return $cdn_url;
}

```

});

Sometimes when the option to crop images is enabled, SPAI thinks it is not safe to crop an image, but you want to crop it anyway. Please add this attribute to force cropping:

```
<img data-spai-crop="true" ....

```

ShortPixel Adaptive Images triggers a JS event after the initial processing of the HTML page in the browser: spai-body-handled, an event after each processed DOM mutation when at least one URL has been replaced: spai-block-handled and an event after the URL of each element has its URL updated lazily ( entering the viewport): spai-element-handled

To exclude certain images, you can also add the following attributes within the ‘IMG’ tag to the markup:

```
    <img data-spai-excluded="true" ...> --> this will completely exclude from processing the image which has this attribute;
    <img data-spai-eager="true" ...> --> this will exclude the image from being lazy-loaded by the plugin;
    <img data-spai-noresize="true" ...> --> this will prevent the image from being resized by the plugin.

```

For adding custom replacement rules use:

```
add_filter('shortpixel/ai/customRules', 'my_function');

```

The function is given an array and should append ShortPixel\AI\TagRule instances to the given array , as in the example below.

A real-world example of custom image attributes, a custom srcset, and a custom JSON data attribute:

```
add_filter('shortpixel/ai/customRules', 'spai_to_iconic');
function spai_to_iconic($tagRules) {
    //lazy-loaded data-iconic-woothumbs-src attribute
    $tagRules[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('img', 'data-iconic-woothumbs-src');
    //eager attribute
    $tagRules[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('img', 'data-large_image', false, false, false, false, true);
    //lazy srcset style attribute.
    $tagRules[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('img', 'srcset', false, false, false, false, false,
                    'srcset', 'replace_custom_srcset');
    $tagRules[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('div', 'data-default', 'iconic-woothumbs-all-images-wrap', false, false, false, false,
                        'srcset', 'replace_custom_json_attr');
    return $tagRules;
}

```

The parameters of the rule are, in this order:

\* tagName – the tag name

\* attribute to be replaced

\* classFilter – only elements having the class, default false

\* attrFilter – only elements having the attribute, default false

\* attrValFilter only elements having the attribute with the specified value, default false

\* mergeAttr – advanced usage (see code), default false

\* eager – if true the image is replaced server-side, otherwise is lazy-loaded

\* type – advanced usage (see code), default is ‘url’, can also be ‘srcset’ if it has a srcset or json structure

\* callback – advanced usage (see code), default false. Needs to be ‘replace\_custom\_srcset’ if the type is srcset, or ‘replace\_custom\_json\_attr’ if the type is json

\* quickMatch – advanced usage (see code), default false

\* frontEager -advanced usage (see code), default false

In the same manner if you need a rule to be applied only on the front-end (javascript) you can use the following filter:

```
add_filter('shortpixel/ai/customFrontendRules', 'my_function');

```

This rule will only be applied by the New JS Engine (so you need to have the option enabled) and is useful if you have content that is rendered by JavaScript and you need the replacement to be made after the content is rendered.

## FAQ

### What happens when the quota is exceeded?

In your WP dashboard you will be warned when your quota is about to be exhausted and also when it has been exceeded. When the quota is exhausted, the plugin will simply serve the original images from your server, without compression or resizing, until the quota resets.

### What Content Delivery Network (CDN) do you use?

ShortPixel Adaptive Images uses [bunny.net](https://bunny.net/) to offload the images – a global CDN with over [90 edge locations](https://bunny.net/network) around the world.

Both the free and paid plans use the same CDN with the same number of locations.

You can check for yourself how the bunny.net CDN compares to other CDN providers – [here](https://www.cdnperf.com/) (worldwide) and [here](https://www.cdnperf.com/#!performance,North%20America) (North America).

### Can I use a different CDN?

Sure. [Here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/180-can-i-use-a-different-cdn-with-shortpixel-adaptive-images) is how to configure it with Cloudflare and [here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/200-setup-your-stackpath-account-so-that-it-can-work-with-shortpixel-adaptive-images-api)’ is how to configure it with STACKPATH. Please note that if you use another CDN instead of CDN traffic, image credits will be consumed.

If you need further help, please [contact us](https://shortpixel.com/contact).

### What happens if I deactivate the plugin?

You can stop using SPAI at any time, but that means your website will suddenly slow down.

Basically, your website will revert to the original, unoptimized images delivered by your server

### Are there different image optimization levels available?

Yes, you can compress images as Lossy, Glossy or Lossless.

You can learn more about the different optimization levels [here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/11-lossy-glossy-or-lossless-which-one-is-the-best-for-me) or run some free image optimization tests [here](https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression).

### I already used ShortPixel Image Optimizer, can I also use this?

Certainly!

### What is the difference between this plugin and ShortPixel Image Optimizer?

You can see [here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/179-shortpixel-adaptive-images-vs-shortpixel-image-optimizer) the differences between the two services.

### Where can I optimize my images? There’s nothing in my admin panel.

SPAI works differently than a normal image optimizer. [Here is](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/132-how-shortpixel-adaptive-images-work) what it does.

### How can I make sure that the plugin is working well?

You have more information about this [here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/240-is-shortpixel-adaptive-images-working-well-on-my-website).

### I want to use the plugin, what do I have to do?

You can find the detailed instructions [here](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/231-step-by-step-guide-to-install-and-use-shortpixel-adaptive-images-spai).

### My images are getting redirected from cdn.shortpixel.ai, why?

Have a look at [this article](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/148-why-are-my-images-redirected-from-cdn-shortpixel-ai).

### Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin?

Please report security bugs found in the source code of the ShortPixel Adaptive Images plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/shortpixel-adaptive-images). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment, and notify the developers of this plugin.

### SPAI does not work well, I have some problems.

Please check the following things:

1) Make sure your domain [is associated to your account](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/94-how-to-associate-a-domain-to-my-account);

2) Make sure you have enough credits available in your account;

3) Take a look at [this article](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/220-i-installed-shortpixel-adaptive-images-but-it-doesnt-seem-to-work);

4) Take a look at [our knowledge base](https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/category/307-shortpixel-adaptive-images).

### [Google Search Console blocks Shortpixel AI CDN](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/google-search-console-blocks-shortpixel-ai-cdn/)

After A LOT of research on my side (support was responsive but unfortunately not helpful), I have found that cdn.shortpixel.ai is blocked by Google Search Console. How it affects your SEO may be subject to discussion, but definitively, the facts I’m going to expose are not a good sign.
I have read the documentation regarding indexing, and while I understand the theory, the truth is Google disagrees: kb.shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/will-my-sites-images-be-indexed-as-coming-from-shortpixel/
Signs that Google disagrees:
In Search Console>live test >Screenshot diplays broken images (all of them).
“More info” tab on url inspector live shows cdn.shortpixel. ai urls not being loaded. “Other error”
Even my favicon is blocked on the results in Google search images.
I can’t affirm that my Google Images traffic has dropped because of this plugin, but the truth is that my Google Image traffic has decreased dramatically since I activated it a few months ago.
A dramatic amount of images have been deindexed since I installed the CDN.
The images that are currently indexed contain a link to the original image on my server (featured images on posts or pages that link to the original image via meta tags, product images, or widgets that, on click, serve the original image from my own server). So my guess is that Google is crawling the urls of the original image.
Dramatic traffic drop since I’m using short-pixel CDN.
Few posts lately point to the same issue.
How did I arrive at the conclusion that Shortpixel AI is the problem?
I have tried deactivating all plugins but Shortpixel. Problem persist.
I deactivated my theme and activated the WordPress default theme. Problem persist.
Deactivating Cloudflare. Problem persist.
I deactivated all Hotlink protection. Problem persist.
I activated the new AI engine and the problem persist.
Only when I deactivate Shortpixel, magic… it works! I use my theme + Cloudflare + Hotlink protection and a bunch of plugins, and the Search Console url inspector loads all the resources; there are no broken images in the screenshot, and the favicon appears on Google Images results.
Support apparently has no idea about what is going on, even when there are actually a couple of recent threads pointing to the same problem. So up to date I assume there is NO SOLUTION.
MY SOLUTION:
I had another website that uses a different plugin developed by another company that also uses Shortpixel server, and it has the ability to serve images via CDN. Just by chance, I decided to switch the license to this website, and I found out that everything works fine in Search Console!!!
This plugin uses sp-ao.shortpixel.ai server and it seems Google likes it while Shortpixel AI uses cdn.shortpixel.ai and Google doesn’t, for reasons that I don’t know and that I won’t explore so support can do some work ;)I took the time to write this long post for you, that, like me, has probably been hurt in your SEO (I’m an illustrator, so imagine how much damage it may have caused).
I hope those insights point you in the right direction. All the best!Sergio

It fails because of three reasons:
Too many http redirecting going on, which causes Google searchbot to abandon indexing according to Google reports. No it isn’t good for SEO.
The worst one: it expires images on the CDN after some time. I have a webshop with 500 products with multiple images, of which Shortpixel AI stores multiple dimensions. It’s not a high traffic website like amazon. This means when someone visits, a lot of images aren’t served from the CDN, but from the original site.
To add to the pain, it not only expires images, but doesn’t serve the closest webp or avif image by media query. It serves the orininal huge jpg images from the original site.
So in a nutshell, it doesn’t do what it is supposed to do and serves huge originals for a large percentage of visitors. This unfortunately makes the plugin useless. It doesn’t work.

This plugin does everything I need, and the support is generally good, too. If you’re looking for an image CDN service, this one should be high on your consideration list.

From the day I activated this plugin, within one week, all my website images got de-indexed from Google image search. The day I remove the plugin, my images started re-indexing again.
I lost a lot of traffic, and still loosing until this day. It will take months for my images to rank as high as they did before.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
