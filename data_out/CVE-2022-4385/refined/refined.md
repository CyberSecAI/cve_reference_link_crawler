- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not check for authorization in the `update-menu-order` ajax action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization check, allowing arbitrary menu order update.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any logged-in user, even with low-level roles like Subscriber, can change the menu order of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `update-menu-order` and the desired menu order in the `order` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, with any role, including Subscriber.
