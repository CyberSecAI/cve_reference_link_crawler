- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a malicious payload (e.g., `<audio src=x onerror=confirm("XSS")>`) into a campaign title within the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as an administrator account, to access the plugin settings and create a new campaign or edit an existing campaign title. This can occur even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed (e.g., in multisite setups).
