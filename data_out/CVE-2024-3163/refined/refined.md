- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Property Listings plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting contacts in bulk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Absence of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting contacts through a CSRF attack.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when opened by a logged-in admin, triggers the deletion of contacts. The provided PoC link is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?action=bulk-delete&bulk-delete%5B%5D=<<ID_TO_DELETE>>&action2=bulk-delete&page=epl-contacts&view=contacts`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to open a malicious link.
