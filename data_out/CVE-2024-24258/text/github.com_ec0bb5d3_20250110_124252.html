### @sebras **[sebras](/sebras)** commented [Feb 12, 2024](#issue-2129523303)

If fgStructure.CurrentMenu is set when glutAddMenuEntry() or glutAddSubMenu() is called the allocated menuEntry variable will leak. This commit postpones allocating menuEntry until after the error checks, thereby plugging the memory leak.

This fixes [CVE-2024-24258](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vrhp-w2wh-93c3 "CVE-2024-24258") and [CVE-2024-24259](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6h6q-fm45-w3hv "CVE-2024-24259").

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I don't know why these CVEs were filed against MuPDF instead of freeglut, and I doubt that these should be of high severity. Anyway, here is my proposed fix. Please let me know if you want me to change it some how. |

| Thanks! I've no idea how a memory leak can be classified as a "vulnerability", but nevertheless, it's good to not have any :) |
