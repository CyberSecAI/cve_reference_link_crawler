Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `glutAddSubMenu()` function within the `freeglut` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: Memory is allocated for a local variable named `menuEntry` but is not freed under specific error conditions. Specifically, when `fgStructure.CurrentMenu` is set before calling `glutAddSubMenu()`, the memory allocated for `menuEntry` leaks if error checks are triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Repeated calls to `glutAddSubMenu()` under the vulnerable condition will lead to a memory leak, potentially causing the application to consume excessive memory and potentially crash, or become unstable.
- Denial of service by exhausting memory resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Calling the `glutAddSubMenu()` function when `fgStructure.CurrentMenu` is set.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the freeglut library, often used for OpenGL windowing and context management.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to trigger the `glutAddSubMenu()` function in a manner that causes `fgStructure.CurrentMenu` to be set before the function call.
- This might involve using a malicious application or crafting specific input to an application utilizing freeglut.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified in `mupdf`'s bundled `freeglut` library.
- The fix involves postponing memory allocation for `menuEntry` until after the error checks, ensuring that the allocated memory is only used if no errors occur, and it is therefore properly deallocated.
- The vulnerability is also associated with CVE-2024-24259, which is a similar memory leak in the `glutAddMenuEntry()` function.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in freeglut version 3.4.0-7, as indicated in the Fedora update notifications.
