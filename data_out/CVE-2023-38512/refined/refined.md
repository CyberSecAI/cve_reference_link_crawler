- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WpStream plugin <= 4.5.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which means the attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing actions on the vulnerable website without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage to trigger the CSRF. Unauthenticated access is required.
