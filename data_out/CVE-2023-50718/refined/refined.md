- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in `VitessClient.ts`, where the `table_name` provided by the user is not properly escaped before being used in an SQL query. Specifically, the `${args.tn}` variable, which represents the user-provided table name, is directly embedded into the SQL query string without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (CWE-89), specifically the lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries, which leads to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by including special characters (like a single quote) in the table name, leading to arbitrary SQL query execution. This can result in the leakage of sensitive data from the database, potentially including data not intended for the attacker's access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), as the attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable application remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with 'create' access privileges (PR:H), and no user interaction (UI:N) is required to exploit the vulnerability.
