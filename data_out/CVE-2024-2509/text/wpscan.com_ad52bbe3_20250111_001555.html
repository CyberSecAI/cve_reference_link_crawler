## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks < 3.2.26 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor (or above), edit a post in Code Editor mode, put the below code in it and save:
<!-- wp:kadence/advanced-form-text {"uniqueID":"9c5eb1-eb","formID":"1","label":"Name","placeholder":"Mouse Over There!\u0022onmouseover='alert(/XSS/)'"} /-->
The XSS will be trigged when viewing/previewing the post and moving the mouse over the generated input.
