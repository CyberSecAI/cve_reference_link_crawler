Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the usage of the `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking when handling the `curtime` parameter received from web requests. This allows for writing beyond allocated buffer space, causing a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in multiple functions, including `formSetWAN_Wizard534`, `formSetWAN_Wizard55`, `formSetWAN_Wizard56`, `formSetWAN_Wizard7`, `formSetWanDhcpplus`, `formSetWanNonLogin`, `formSetWanPPPoE`, `formSetWanPPTP`, `formSetWanL2TP` and `formLanguageChange`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the `curtime` parameter before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to a denial of service. By sending an overly large `curtime` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the return address, causing the router to crash or become unresponsive. It is implied that remote code execution might be possible, but the details are not provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Page Parameters:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted web request with an oversized `curtime` parameter to the vulnerable functions of the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the local network or remotely if the web interface is exposed to the internet.
- **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests to include the malicious payload in the `curtime` parameter.

**Functions Affected:**

The following functions are specifically mentioned as being vulnerable to a stack overflow:
   - `formSetWAN_Wizard534`
   - `formSetWAN_Wizard55`
   - `formSetWAN_Wizard56`
   - `formSetWAN_Wizard7`
   - `formSetWanDhcpplus`
   - `formSetWanNonLogin`
   - `formSetWanPPPoE`
   - `formSetWanPPTP`
   - `formSetWanL2TP`
   - `formLanguageChange`

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes Proof of Concept (POC) exploit requests for each vulnerable function. These POCs demonstrate how an attacker could trigger the buffer overflow by sending a request with a long `curtime` parameter.
- The D-Link security bulletin mentions that they don't provide vulnerability details to prevent exploit creation, the GitHub content reveals much more details than what D-Link is willing to share.
