### Description

The Disable Json API, Login Lockdown, XMLRPC, Pingback, Stop User Enumeration Anti Hacker Scan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the antihacker\_add\_whitelist() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.51. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add their IP Address to the whitelist circumventing protection
