DCMTK contains the following sub-packages, each in its own sub-directory:

* **config** - configuration utilities for DCMTK
* **dcmapps** - a collection of cross-module command line tools
* **dcmdata** - a data encoding/decoding library and utility apps
* **dcmect** - a library for working with Enhanced CT objects
* **dcmfg** - a library for working with functional groups
* **dcmimage** - adds support for color images to dcmimgle
* **dcmimgle** - an image processing library and utility apps
* **dcmiod** - a library for working with information objects and modules
* **dcmjpeg** - a compression/decompression library and utility apps
* **dcmjpls** - a compression/decompression library and utility apps
* **dcmnet** - a networking library and utility apps
* **dcmpmap** - a library for working with parametric map objects
* **dcmpstat** - a presentation state library and utility apps
* **dcmqrdb** - an image database server
* **dcmrt** - a radiation therapy library and utility apps
* **dcmseg** - a library for working with segmentation objects
* **dcmsign** - a digital signature library and utility apps
* **dcmsr** - a structured reporting library and utility apps
* **dcmtls** - security extensions for the network library
* **dcmtract** - a library for working with tractography results
* **dcmwlm** - a modality worklist database server
* **oficonv** - a character set conversion library
* **oflog** - a logging library based on log4cplus
* **ofstd** - a library of general purpose classes

Each sub-directory (except *config*) contains further sub-directories for application source code (*apps*), library source code (*libsrc*), library include files (*include*), configuration data (*etc*), documentation (*docs*), sample and support data (*data*) as well as test programs (*tests*).
