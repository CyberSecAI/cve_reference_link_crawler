The provided content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A deadlock can occur in the `smb2_find_smb_tcon()` function within the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) client. This happens because the `cifs_tcp_ses_lock` is held while calling `cifs_put_smb_ses()`, potentially leading to a deadlock scenario.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:**  The primary vulnerability is a deadlock. The `smb2_find_smb_tcon` function acquires the `cifs_tcp_ses_lock`, and if the required `tcon` is not found, it attempts to release the session by calling `cifs_put_smb_ses` without first releasing the lock, leading to a deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A deadlock can effectively freeze the CIFS client, preventing it from functioning correctly. This leads to a denial of service for SMB/CIFS functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trigger the `smb2_find_smb_tcon` function in a way that results in a call to `cifs_put_smb_ses` when a matching tcon is not found which can cause the deadlock. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the SMB/CIFS client operations to trigger the conditions that will cause the deadlock. This could involve specific network conditions, SMB requests, or server behavior that results in the `smb2_find_smb_tcon` function failing to locate a tcon.

**Mitigation:**
The provided patches fix the issue by releasing the `cifs_tcp_ses_lock` before calling `cifs_put_smb_ses`. This ensures that the lock is not held during the session release operation, thus preventing the deadlock.
