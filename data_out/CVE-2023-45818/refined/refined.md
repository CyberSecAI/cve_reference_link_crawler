Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-45818:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how TinyMCE handles HTML snippets during undo/redo operations, specifically related to string manipulation when trimming HTML before storing it in the undo stack.  The combination of string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native DOMParser API (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5)  mutates the HTML maliciously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Mutation Cross-site Scripting (mXSS):**  The core issue is a mXSS vulnerability in TinyMCE's undo/redo functionality.
- **Insecure String Manipulation:** Internal trimming functions manipulate HTML as strings, which can lead to unexpected behavior when the HTML is later parsed.
- **Unsafe HTML Parsing:** When HTML snippets are restored from the undo stack, the reparative parsing by the browser's DOMParser API or TinyMCE's SaxParser API can introduce malicious mutations in the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in:
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information via JavaScript injection.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attacker could potentially hijack user sessions.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying content, defacing the web page, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Snippet:** A carefully crafted malicious HTML snippet is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Undo/Redo Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user performs undo or redo operations on the malicious content.
- **getContent/resetContent APIs and Autosave Plugin:** The vulnerability is also present when using the `getContent` API with the `format: 'raw'` option, the `resetContent` API, and the Autosave plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Injection Capability:** An attacker needs to inject malicious HTML content into the TinyMCE editor. This could be done through various means depending on the application.
- **User Interaction:** The user must perform an undo/redo operation or use vulnerable API for the exploit to be successful.
- **No Special Privileges:**  The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects TinyMCE versions prior to 5.10.8 and 6.7.1.
- The vulnerability was patched by implementing node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation when trimming HTML.
- The content also mentions another XSS vulnerability in the Notification Manager API (CVE-2023-45819) which is separate from CVE-2023-45818.
