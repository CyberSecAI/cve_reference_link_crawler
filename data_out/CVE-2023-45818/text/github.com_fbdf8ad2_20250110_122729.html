## Description

### Impact

A [mutation cross-site scripting](https://researchgate.net/publication/266654651_mXSS_attacks_Attacking_well-secured_web-applications_by_using_innerHTML_mutations) (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo and redo functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the [SaxParser API](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.saxparser/) (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be executed.

​This vulnerability also impacts these related TinyMCE APIs and plugins:​

* [`tinymce.Editor.getContent({ format: 'raw' })`](https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/apis/tinymce.editor/#getContent)
* [`tinymce.Editor.resetContent()`](https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/apis/tinymce.editor/#resetContent)
* [Autosave Plugin](https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/autosave/)

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation.

### Fix

To avoid this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.10.8 or higher for TinyMCE 5.x.
* Upgrade to TinyMCE 6.7.1 or higher for TinyMCE 6.x.

### Acknowledgements

Tiny Technologies would like to thank Masato Kinugawa of [Cure53](https://cure53.de/) for discovering this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
