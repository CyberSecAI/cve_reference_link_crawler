Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for the table's dormant flag in the `nf_tables_netdev_event` function within the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem. Specifically, when a network device is released, the `nf_tables_netdev_event` function is called.  This function iterates through the registered hooks and unregisters them. However, it fails to check if the associated table is marked as dormant before attempting to unregister a net hook. If the table is dormant, the hook might already be unregistered, leading to a double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Unregister/Double Free:** The core issue is attempting to unregister a network hook that has already been unregistered. This leads to a double-free vulnerability because the associated memory is freed twice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash due to the double-free vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service (DoS). The provided logs clearly show a kernel panic with a call trace related to `__nf_unregister_net_hook`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Device Release:** The vulnerability is triggered when a network device is released, causing the `nf_tables_netdev_event` function to be called.
- **Netfilter/nf_tables:** Exploitation requires the use of `nf_tables` and the manipulation of tables to reach a dormant state.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System Access:** An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger a network device release which could be achieved with sufficient privileges.
- **Netfilter Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of how `nf_tables` works.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves adding a check within the `nft_netdev_event` function:
    ```c
    if (!(ctx->chain->table->flags & NFT_TABLE_F_DORMANT))
        nf_unregister_net_hook(ctx->net, &found->ops);
    ```
   This check ensures that `nf_unregister_net_hook` is only called if the table is not dormant.
- The patch also includes a fix to remove the element from the list and free the memory:
   ```c
   list_del_rcu(&found->list);
   kfree_rcu(found, rcu);
   ```
- The faulty code was located within `net/netfilter/nft_chain_filter.c`.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a double-unregister/double-free issue within the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem due to improper handling of dormant tables during network device release. This leads to a kernel crash and a denial of service. The fix involves adding a check for the dormant flag before unregistering a network hook.
