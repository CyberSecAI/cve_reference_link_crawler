About us

![CODE WHITE LOGO](https://code-white.com/images/Logo_Wortmarke_vert_weiss.svg)

 CODE WHITE provides premier cyber security services to its clients and has its own approach to information security:
uncompromising realism.

# Intelligence Driven Security

CODE WHITE seasoned experts introduce the attacker's point of view and simulate highly capable, real-world attackers by using their current tactics, tools and procedures.

The holistic approach of CODE WHITE helps clients by augmenting their internal view of the security posture (â Compliance Driven Security) with that of a professional attacker (â Intelligence Driven Security). This enables a better understanding of how real attacks will affect them and which defensive efforts are the most effective ones. All available systems, applications and information are always in focus.

## Intelligence Driven Security

![](./images/security-icons_intelligence.png)

* Holistic view from the outside
* Realistic mindset of attackers
* Exploitable attack paths
* Relevant vulnerabilities only

Modern corporationsâ attack surface is continuously exposed to attacks. CODE WHITE constantly monitors the clientâs attack surface for security-relevant changes and vulnerabilities. Clients are pro-actively notified with actionable information about issues the moment they arise. Since only relevant issues are reported, these notifications are âall signal â no noiseâ. The independent evaluation of the clientâs security posture allows CODE WHITE to assess the effectiveness of defensive efforts and to advance strategies that matter.

Based on this INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN SECURITY approach, CODE WHITE offers two exclusive services:

# Initial Assessment

The INITIAL ASSESSMENT (INI) simulates a real cyber attack in the form of a holistic RedTeam scenario. The purpose is to understand the approach of real attackers, to gain transparency about how vulnerable an enterprise currently is and to gauge its level of defense. This approach helps to significantly improve resilience against real threat actors.

Identify & exploit vulnerabilities in the complete internet footprint (including phishing)

Move laterally & compromise neuralgic IT systems and administrative accounts

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_3.png)

Avoid detection, establish persistence, exfiltrate data and point out business risks

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_4.png)

Generate extensive documentation of the attacks done including precise & strategic recommendations

# Security Intelligence Service

The continuous SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (SIS) offers continuous
support from an attackerâs perspective. The relevant attack surface is
constantly and carefully assessed, exploitable vulnerabilities are
reported expeditiously and emerging threats are announced immediately.

An INITIAL ASSESSMENT typically leads to a partnership with CODE WHITE
wherein the SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE provides âthe hacker at the
tableâ for an extended duration. Within such a partnership, clients have
access to specialized services including but not limited to RedTeam
assessments, threat intelligence, penetration tests, product security
reviews or customized training. This helps clients stay ahead of threats
and sustainably improve their security resilience level over time.
