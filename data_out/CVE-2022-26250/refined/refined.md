Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2022-26250:

**CVE-2022-26250: Local Privilege Escalation via weak service permissions**

*   **Root Cause:** The Synaman installer places the application in `C:\Synaman` with weak directory permissions. Authenticated users have write permissions to this directory and its subfolders. The "SynaMan" service runs as `LocalSystem`.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  Insecure file system permissions on the installation directory, allowing any authenticated user to modify or replace the `SynaMan.exe` executable.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Local privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. An attacker can replace the legitimate `SynaMan.exe` with a malicious executable. When the service restarts (e.g., upon reboot), the attacker's payload executes with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access. An attacker with a standard user account on the vulnerable system can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   A standard user account on the target system.
    *   Ability to write to the `C:\SynaMan` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially found in Synaman version 5.0. Version 5.1 changed the default installation path to `Program Files` but did not fully fix the issue.
*   The content provides detailed proof of concept steps for exploitation, including the use of `msfvenom` to generate a reverse shell payload.
*   The content notes that while version 5.1 claims to fix this vulnerability, it does not.
