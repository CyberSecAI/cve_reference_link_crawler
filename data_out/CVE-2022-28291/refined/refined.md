- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nessus scanner stores policy credentials in cleartext within the `nessusd` process memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522). The application does not properly protect sensitive credentials, allowing them to be exposed in the process memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve stored credentials for various systems and services from the Nessus Policies. This could lead to the compromise of the corresponding assets, internal domains, and networks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to gain local access to the system where the Nessus scanner is running and possess debug privileges to create a process dump of the `nessusd` process. The attacker then parses this dump to extract credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires an authenticated user account with debug privileges on the system where the Nessus scanner is installed to create process dump and further parse it to extract the information.
