- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'url' parameter within the EE Button widget of the "Extensions for Elementor" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing the website
  - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the 'url' parameter within the EE Button widget.
- An attacker would insert malicious JavaScript code into this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to WordPress.
- This level of access allows the attacker to modify page content by using the Elementor page builder.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Extensions for Elementor" plugin up to and including version 2.0.30.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.31 by implementing sanitization and escaping.
- The provided code snippets show changes that include sanitization using `samitize_text_field` and `esc_url` functions, which were implemented to mitigate the vulnerability
- The changelog of the plugin highlights the fix.

This vulnerability is considered a medium severity risk with a CVSS score of 6.4.
