A very useful plugin to add a document download manager to Elementor. As I am not using any other feature, it would be great to be able to deactivate some of the functions!

### [Excellent start – keep working on it](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-start-keep-working-on-it/)

This plugin has some really useful features, particularly an easy to use mega-dropdown designer, and a load of other small and large items that are excellent extensions to Elementor. It is obviously a relatively new development so to be expected that there are some bugs but I can see releases have happened to resolve things so obviously support is good. The previous reviewer seems to have ignored the Christmas period and expected instant replies from support which seems a little unreasonable. From our point of view we use this on a number of sites already and find it most helpful. Suggest focus on the support and keeping up to date on bugs – but all in all easy to use and very helpful.

### [A work in progress but admin page issues](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-work-in-progress-but-admin-page-issues/)

I really like the plugin but it has some debugging that needs to be done. 3 days to at least respond is a reasonable. Haven’t heard anything as of yet.
Adds extra custom post types that clutters up the admin page. When I try to add posts the admin page is all messed up. I spent probably 2 hours going through each plugin, deactivating, reactivating, and testing after removing this plugin. The results were that ACF fields were not functioning properly when this plugin is active.
I think this plugin has lots of potential but the commitment on follow up remains to be seen.
