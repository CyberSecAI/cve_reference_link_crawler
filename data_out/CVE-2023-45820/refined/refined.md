The provided content is related to CVE-2023-45820.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Directus websocket server crashes when it receives an invalid WebSocket frame. The server does not properly catch the error, leading to a server crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling in the websocket server.
- Lack of validation for incoming WebSocket frames.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can crash the Directus server by sending specially crafted invalid WebSocket frames. This can lead to service interruption, and the server needs to be manually restarted or have an automatic recovery mechanism in place.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack by sending malicious WebSocket messages to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the websocket port. No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) script to trigger the vulnerability, as well as a fix by adding an error handling for invalid WebSocket messages.
- The vulnerability affects Directus versions >=10.4 and was fixed in version 10.6.2.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a high impact on availability.
- The fix involves using `prependListener` on the socket to handle errors when receiving an invalid message.
