Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-2293:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents mention CVE-2021-2293. The Oracle document lists it under the "MySQL Server" section, within the "MySQL Risk Matrix", with the description "Server: Stored Procedure". The NetApp document lists it in the advisory related to MySQL vulnerabilities, confirming that it's a MySQL related vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the stored procedure functionality of the MySQL Server.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed, but it appears to be related to how stored procedures are handled.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS), meaning an attacker could cause the MySQL server to hang or crash frequently by repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability. It does not cause full system compromise, but results in partial or complete DoS of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is "Network". The attacker would need to be able to interact with the MySQL server over the network, i.e. establish a network connection to the database port.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would likely need to be a privileged user to execute or call a specific stored procedure, since it indicates that Privileges are "HIGH". The Oracle risk matrix states that “Privs Req'd” is not null, and that User interaction is none, however it is not clearly specified what kind of privilege is required, only that the “Scope” is unchanged.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in the April 2021 Critical Patch Update from Oracle and in a NetApp advisory.
*   The CVSS score for this CVE is 4.9 (MEDIUM) according to the NetApp advisory.
*   The vulnerability impacts MySQL Server versions 8.0.23 and prior according to both sources.
*   The NetApp document provides additional context that the exploitation of this, and other related CVE's, may allow unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, or unauthorized access or modification of server data. The document also explicitly clarifies that this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication and high privileges.

In summary, CVE-2021-2293 is a medium severity vulnerability in MySQL Server's stored procedure functionality that can be exploited by privileged users to cause a denial of service.
