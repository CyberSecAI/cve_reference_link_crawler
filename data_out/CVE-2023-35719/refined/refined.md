Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-35719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication of data received via HTTP by the Password Reset Portal used by the ADSelfService Plus GINA client. This means the client doesn't verify the authenticity of data it receives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Data Verification:** The core weakness is the GINA client's failure to properly authenticate data received over HTTP. This allows an attacker to send malicious data to the client, bypassing normal authentication procedures.
*   **Insecure Configuration (HTTP usage):** While not a vulnerability in itself, the use of HTTP without TLS is a major contributing factor. The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable when the product is used in HTTP mode without TLS configured. The vendor also acknowledges that using the product in HTTP mode should only be for initial exploration and not for production environments.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The advisory explicitly states that "Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability," highlighting a critical flaw in the authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code is executed in the context of SYSTEM, the highest privilege level on Windows, giving the attacker full control over the compromised machine.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can completely bypass the normal authentication mechanisms of ADSelfService Plus.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack vector requires the attacker to have physical access to the target machine. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the GINA client, which resides on client machines.
*   **Network:** The attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the vulnerable client, which typically would be on the same network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Presence:** The attacker must have physical access to the machine running the vulnerable GINA client.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the target client over the network, likely a local network in many scenarios.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP requests.
    
**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor initially stated that the vulnerability could be mitigated by following best practices which include using HTTPS, however, the ZDI confirmed the product is still vulnerable even with best practices implemented and therefore still vulnerable if the system is running the HTTP protocol.
*   The vendor's response indicates that this vulnerability occurs due to misconfiguration, and the usage of HTTP instead of HTTPS, and that the agent must be reinstalled after configuring the server with TLS
*   The vendor plans to introduce in-product banners alerting administrators of misconfigurations but they have not released a patch for the vulnerability itself.

In summary, CVE-2023-35719 is a critical vulnerability that allows a physically present attacker to bypass authentication and execute code with SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the lack of data verification when the ADSelfService Plus GINA client communicates via HTTP. While the vendor attributes the vulnerability to a misconfiguration by using HTTP instead of HTTPS, ZDI states the product remains vulnerable even with best practices, and the vendor has not fully addressed the vulnerability with a patch, instead providing guidance on proper configuration and deployment, which should be considered a workaround.
