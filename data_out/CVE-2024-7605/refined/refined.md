Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `ha_ajax` function in the HelloAsso WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for handling AJAX requests, including updates to plugin options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check within the `ha_ajax` function. This allows authenticated users, even with low-level permissions such as "Contributor" to execute the function and modify plugin options.
*  **Insecure Data Handling:** The code uses `sanitize_text_field` and `sanitize_title_with_dashes` which are not appropriate for sanitizing data being used to modify plugin options.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Option Modification:** Attackers with "Contributor" or higher access can modify plugin options. The impact of this can be service disruption depending on the options that are altered.
*   **Potential Service Disruption:** Modifying plugin options could disrupt the intended functionality of the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is initiated via network requests to the WordPress site using the `ha_ajax` AJAX action.
*   **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress user account with the "Contributor" role or higher.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress site.
*   **Understanding of the Plugin's AJAX Interface:** Knowledge of how the plugin uses the `ha_ajax` action is necessary to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including version 1.1.10.
*   The fix is implemented in version 1.1.11, where a check for the 'manage_options' capability was added. This ensures that only administrators can execute the function.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `/admin/class-hello-asso-admin.php` file, specifically in the `ha_ajax` function.
*   The fix was introduced in changeset 3145151, as can be seen in the diff of the `class-hello-asso-admin.php` file.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis.
