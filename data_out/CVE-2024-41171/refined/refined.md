- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not properly enforce access restrictions to scripts that are regularly executed by the system with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker could escalate their privileges in the underlying system. This means they could gain higher level control over the device than intended.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the system.
