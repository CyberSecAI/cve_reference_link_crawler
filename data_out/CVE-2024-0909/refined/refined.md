Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access restrictions on protected content through the REST API. The plugin failed to properly restrict access to posts/pages marked as restricted for unauthenticated users when accessed via the REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The plugin allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass content restrictions and access protected content via the REST API.
*   **Protection Mechanism Bypass:** The plugin's intended protection mechanism is bypassed, allowing unauthorized access to restricted content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to content intended to be restricted to logged-in users, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*  **Information Exposure:** Confidential data within the protected content may be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API:** The vulnerability is exploited through the WordPress REST API, specifically by accessing the API endpoints that expose post and page data.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker can be any user (or no user) who has access to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress site to make requests to the REST API.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Anonymous Restricted Content" plugin up to and including version 1.6.2.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.6.3.
*   The patch includes modifications to the `class-arc-public.php` file, specifically to the `restricted_rest_api` function. This function now correctly checks and restricts access when requested through REST API, either by returning a `WP_Error` for single items or by unsetting restricted items within an array result.
*   The fix addresses the issue of both individual posts/pages and lists of posts/pages that might be exposed through the REST API.
