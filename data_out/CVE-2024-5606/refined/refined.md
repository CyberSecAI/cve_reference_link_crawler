- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `question_id` parameter in the `qsm_bulk_delete_question_from_database` AJAX action is not properly validated and escaped before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In the provided PoC, a time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated by using `SLEEP(5)` to cause a 5-second delay.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `qsm_bulk_delete_question_from_database` AJAX action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role. They also need a valid nonce for deletion of quiz questions.
