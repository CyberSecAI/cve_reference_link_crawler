- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal (Unified CCMP) does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
