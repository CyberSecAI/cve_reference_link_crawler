**CVE-2024-34593**: Improper input validation in `librtp.so`

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the `librtp.so` library, specifically during the parsing and distribution of RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) packets.

*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of RTCP packets, allowing malformed data to be processed, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is remote, and it involves sending specially crafted RTCP packets to a vulnerable device.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable device. User interaction is also required to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Affected Versions:** Android 12, 13, and 14 are listed as affected.

* **Patch:** The patch adds proper input validation to mitigate this issue.
