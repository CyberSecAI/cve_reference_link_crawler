Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the unconditional overwriting of a key's expiration time during the instantiation process. Specifically, the `key_set_expiry` function was being called regardless of whether a specific expiry was set by the pre-parser, effectively defaulting the expiration to `TIME64_MAX` (permanent).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the unconditional overwrite of the key expiration time. This prevents user-space from setting a desired expiration, thus disabling mechanisms relying on key expiration, such as DNS updates where keys need to expire and be refreshed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is the inability to set a key expiration, leading to issues such as:
- Disabling further DNS updates since the key's expiry is set to permanent.
- Breaking key management and invalidation processes that rely on time-based expiry.

**Attack Vectors:**
- This is not a traditional attack vector in that an attacker does not directly exploit the flaw, rather it is a coding flaw in the key instantiation logic.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by creating or instantiating keys, and using a key type that uses the pre-parser to set a specific expiry time.
- In the case of DNS, the system would be unable to perform key rotation as the original expiry would be overwritten with `TIME64_MAX`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed as it is a flaw in the way keys are instantiated in the kernel.
- An attacker would not need any additional privileges to cause the behavior. It is triggered by the normal instantiation process.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix introduces a check to ensure that `key_set_expiry` is only called when the pre-parser sets a specific expiry (i.e., not `TIME64_MAX`).
- The vulnerability affects systems using the Linux kernel's key management system, particularly those using keys with expiration times set by user-space.
- This vulnerability was fixed by the patch described in the commits.
