# Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Privacy Center of SERVER\_SIDE\_FIDES\_API\_URL

Moderate

[Kelsey-Ethyca](/Kelsey-Ethyca)
published
GHSA-53q7-4874-24qg
Jul 3, 2024

## Package

pip

ethyca-fides
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.19.0

## Patched versions

2.39.2

## Description

`SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port.

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL.

### Impact

Disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.2`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds.

### Proof of Concept

1. Set the value of the environment variable `FIDES_PRIVACY_CENTER__SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` of your Fides Privacy Center container before start-up to a private value such as `https://some.private.domain.name/api/v1` and start the Privacy Center application.
2. Once the application is up, perform a HTTP GET request of the Privacy Center's main page e.g. `https://privacy.example.com` . The value of `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is returned in the response's body.

```
~ ❯ curl -s https://privacy.example.com/ | \
grep '__NEXT_DATA__' | \
sed 's/.*<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application\/json">//;s/<\/script>.*//' | \
jq '.props.serverEnvironment.settings.SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL'
"https://some.private.domain.name/api/v1"

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
