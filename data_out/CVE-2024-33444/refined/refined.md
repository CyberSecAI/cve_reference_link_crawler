Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-controlled input `$table` in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application constructs an SQL query by concatenating a user-supplied string (`$table`) into the query: `SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM '.$table`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `$table` variable before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data)
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    *   Potential full database compromise
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by using `sleep()` function or other resource-intensive queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `/admin.php?s=/Model/generate.html`.
*   **`table` parameter:**  The malicious SQL code is injected through the `table` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker likely needs to be authenticated as an admin user to access the `/admin.php` area, as indicated by the provided cookie in the PoC.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:**
    *   `wwwroot/Application/Admin/Controller/ModelController.class.php#L148`: Where the `$table` variable gets user input.
    *   `wwwroot/Application/Admin/Model/ModelModel.class.php#L122`: Where the `$table` variable is directly used in the SQL query.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC shows a POST request that injects the payload `onethink_action;select sleep(60)` into the `table` parameter, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL.
