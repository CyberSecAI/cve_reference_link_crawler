- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The "schedule editor decoupled" feature of ScienceLogic SL1 takes unsanitized user-controlled input and passes it directly to a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary SQL injection, potentially leading to complete compromise of the database and application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network accessible (AV:N) and exploitable with low privileges (PR:L) with no user interaction needed (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  A low-privileged attacker with network access to the ScienceLogic SL1 platform can exploit this vulnerability.
