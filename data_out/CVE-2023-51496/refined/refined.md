- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in functions, allowing unprivileged users to perform actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication.
