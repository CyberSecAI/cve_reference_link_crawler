Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41941:

**CVE-2023-41941**

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Affected Plugin:** AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 3.0.12 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization checks on an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate credentials IDs of AWS credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the actual credentials.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Attacker makes an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin fails to validate user permissions when accessing a specific HTTP endpoint. This allows an attacker with the Overall/Read permission to obtain the IDs of stored AWS credentials, which they can use in combination with another vulnerability to gain access to the actual stored credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   A fix for this vulnerability is not available at the time of the advisory.
*   The advisory provides more detail than the CVE description, including the specific permission required for exploitation and the impact of the vulnerability.
