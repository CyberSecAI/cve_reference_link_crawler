SECURITY-3233 / CVE-2023-41930 (path traversal) &amp; CVE-2023-41931 (XSS)
Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not
restrict a `name` query parameter when rendering a history entry. This
allows attackers to have Jenkins render a manipulated configuration history
that was not created by the plugin.

The history view does not property sanitize or escape the timestamp value
from history entries when rendering a history entry. This typically isn't a
problem, as the value is numeric in genuine history entries. Combined with
the path traversal vulnerability, this results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to
create a file on the controller (e.g., archived artifacts).


SECURITY-3235 / CVE-2023-41932 (path traversal) &amp; CVE-2023-41933 (XXE)
Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not
restrict `timestamp` query parameters in multiple endpoints. This allows
attackers with Job Config History/DeleteEntry permission to delete
attacker-specified directories on the Jenkins controller file system as
long as they contain a file called `history.xml`.

Additionally, Job Configuration History Plugin 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and
earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity
(XXE) attacks. This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to have
Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.


SECURITY-3257 / CVE-2023-41934
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin integrates with Config File Provider
Plugin to specify custom Maven settings, including credentials for
authentication.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 1330.v18e473854496 and earlier does not
properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) usernames of credentials
specified in custom Maven settings in Pipeline build logs if "Treat
username as secret" is checked.


SECURITY-3227 / CVE-2023-41935
Azure AD Plugin 396.v86ce29279947 and earlier, except
378.380.v545b_1154b_3fb_, does not use a constant-time comparison when
checking whether the provided and expected CSRF protection nonce are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid nonce.


SECURITY-3228 / CVE-2023-41936
Google Login Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison
when checking whether the provided and expected token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid token.


SECURITY-3165 / CVE-2023-41937
Bitbucket Push and Pull Request Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at
`/bitbucket-hook/` to receive webhook notifications.

When acting on these notifications, Bitbucket Push and Pull Request Plugin
2.4.0 through 2.8.3 (both inclusive) trusts values provided in the webhook
payload, including certain URLs, and uses configured Bitbucket credentials
to connect to those URLs. This allows attackers to capture Bitbucket
credentials stored in Jenkins by sending a crafted webhook payload.

NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that a build is triggered. This is
the case when the repository has changed since the previous build, or the
option "Trigger also if nothing has changed in the repo" is checked.


SECURITY-3018 / CVE pending
Qualys Container Scanning Connector Plugin 1.6.2.6 and earlier does not
correctly perform a permission check in multiple HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking
Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:

* Enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
  Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using
  another vulnerability.
* Connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.


SECURITY-2924 / CVE-2022-46751
Ivy Plugin 2.5 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy vulnerable to
CVE-2022-46751.

This allows attackers able to control the input file for the "Trigger the
build of other projects based on the Ivy dependency management system"
post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses
external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3093 / CVE-2023-41938
Ivy Plugin 2.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP
endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to delete disabled modules.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3064 / CVE-2023-41939
SSH2 Easy Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not verify that permissions
configured to be granted are enabled. This may allow users formerly granted
(typically optional permissions, like Overall/Manage) to access
functionality they're no longer entitled to.

NOTE: As a workaround, administrators can save the permission configuration
after disabling a permission, as that will overwrite any permission
assignments of disabled permissions.


SECURITY-3190 / CVE-2023-41940
TAP Plugin 2.3 and earlier does not escape TAP file contents.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control TAP file contents.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3101 (1) / CVE-2023-41941
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of AWS credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3101 (2) / CVE-2023-41942 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2023-41943 (permission check)
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to clear the SQS queue.

Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3102 / CVE-2023-41944
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not escape the queue
name parameter passed to a form validation URL, when rendering an error
message.

This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

NOTE: Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a
link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.263/#formvalidation[security hardening] for form
validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be
injected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3065 / CVE-2023-41945
Assembla Auth Plugin provides an authorization strategy that defines four
levels of access to Jenkins, based on the corresponding permissions in
Assembla spaces: ALL, EDIT, VIEW, and NONE.

Assembla Auth Plugin 1.14 and earlier does not verify that the permissions
it grants are enabled. This results in users with EDIT permissions to be
granted Overall/Manage and Overall/SystemRead permissions, even if those
permissions are disabled and should not be granted.

NOTE: Additionally, the plugin also grants the deprecated permissions
Overall/RunScripts, Overall/UploadPlugins and Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter
to users with EDIT access. These permissions allow arbitrary code execution
through various means in Jenkins before 2.222. Additionally, plugins not
yet adapted to the changes in Jenkins 2.222 may also provide access to
sensitive features to users with these permissions.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3082 / CVE-2023-41946 (CSRF) &amp; CVE-2023-41947 (permission check)
Frugal Testing Plugin 1.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to do the following:

* Connect to Frugal Testing using attacker-specified username and password.
* Retrieve test IDs and names from Frugal Testing, if a valid credential
  corresponds to the attacker-specified username.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
