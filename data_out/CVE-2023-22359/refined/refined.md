- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Prior to the fix, an authenticated user could enumerate usernames via the REST API without having the necessary read permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper permission checks in the REST API endpoints for user management. Specifically, the `POST /domain-types/user_config/collections/all`, `PUT /objects/user_config/{username}`, and `DELETE /objects/user_config/{username}` endpoints did not enforce read permissions for users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could enumerate usernames by sending requests to these endpoints, which they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, specifically via the REST API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Checkmk system.
