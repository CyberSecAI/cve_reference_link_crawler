Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `middleware/log.go` file, where user-supplied values from the request (`c.Request`) are directly logged without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Log Injection:** The application is vulnerable to log injection attacks because it does not sanitize user inputs before logging them. Specifically, the `uri`, `method`, `query`, `body` and `response` fields are directly logged.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate log content by injecting malicious code or special characters into request parameters (URI, query, body) or response body.
- This could lead to:
    - **Leakage of sensitive information:** Attackers can potentially inject log entries that expose sensitive data.
    - **Misuse of log files:** Manipulated logs could be used to mislead administrators, cover up malicious activity, or cause other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can inject malicious payloads by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with malicious data in the URL path, query parameters, request body or response body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No special privileges or internal network access is needed.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing the input before logging. The `utils/tools.go` file was updated to include a `SanitizeInput` function which replaces newline, carriage return and tab characters with their escaped equivalents, and encodes non-printable characters to their hexadecimal representation. Additionally, the log entries now reference the sanitized data from `accessLog` struct. The `cleanData` function was also added to recursively sanitize struct fields, slices and maps.
