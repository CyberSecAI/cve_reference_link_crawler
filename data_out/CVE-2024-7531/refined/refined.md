    "CVE-2024-7531": {
      "root_cause": "Calling PK11_Encrypt() in NSS using CKM_CHACHA20 and the same buffer for input and output.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Plaintext can be revealed when using the same buffer for input and output in PK11_Encrypt with CKM_CHACHA20."
      ],
      "impact": "On Intel Sandy Bridge processors, the QUIC header protection feature using ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite can expose plaintext. This could allow a network observer to identify packets as coming from the same source even with network path changes. Connection failure is the most likely outcome, but data could be revealed.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network observer monitoring traffic."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be in a position to observe network traffic and the connection needs to be using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite. The underlying processor needs to be an Intel Sandy Bridge processor."
