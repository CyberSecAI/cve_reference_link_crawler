Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Broken Access Control, specifically the absence of proper authorization checks.

Impact of exploitation: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

Attack vectors: The attack vector involves exploiting a function that lacks the proper authorization checks.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user and needs to be able to access the vulnerable function in the WordPress theme.
