Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetCfm` function of the Tenda AC500 router firmware. Specifically, the `funcpara1` parameter, received via a POST request to `/goform/setcfm`, is used in a call to `sprintf` within the `save_list_data` function.
*   The `sprintf` function copies the user-supplied `funcpara1` data into a fixed-size buffer `v10` (64 bytes). If the length of `funcpara1` exceeds the buffer's capacity, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121/CWE-119):** The primary vulnerability is that the size of the destination buffer is fixed, while the size of the copied data is determined by the user-controlled parameter. This leads to a buffer overflow when the user-supplied data is larger than the destination buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't perform checks on the length of the `funcpara1` before using it in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the router. This could lead to data exfiltration (confidentiality), data manipulation (integrity), and denial-of-service (availability).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/setcfm` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Tenda AC500 router. Since the endpoint is typically within a private network, the attacker would likely have to be on the same network as the device, or have a way to route traffic to the router.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/setcfm`) and the vulnerable parameter (`funcpara1`).
*  **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to construct HTTP POST requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** Tenda AC500 router, firmware version 2.0.1.9(1307).
*   **Exploit Availability:** A proof-of-concept exploit is available, indicating that the vulnerability is easily exploitable.
*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor has not responded to the disclosure.
*   **No Known Countermeasures:** There is currently no known patch or workaround for this vulnerability.
*   The exploit code shows that sending a large amount of "a" as the `funcpara1` parameter causes the buffer overflow.
