```
Guilhem Moulin noticed that the fix to CVE-2023-35936 was incomplete.
An attacker could get around it by double-encoding the malicious
extension to create or override arbitrary files.

    $ echo '![](data://image/png;base64,cHJpbnQgImhlbGxvIgo=;.lua+%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fb%252elua)' >b.md
    $ .cabal/bin/pandoc b.md --extract-media=bar
    <p><img
    src="bar/2a0eaa89f43fada3e6c577beea4f2f8f53ab6a1d.lua+%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fb%2elua" /></p>
    $ cat b.lua
    print "hello"
    $ find bar
    bar/
    bar/2a0eaa89f43fada3e6c577beea4f2f8f53ab6a1d.lua+

This commit adds a test case for this more complex attack and fixes
the vulnerability.  (The fix is quite simple: if the URL-unescaped
filename or extension contains a '%', we just use the sha1 hash of the
contents as the canonical name, just as we do if the filename contains
'..'.)
