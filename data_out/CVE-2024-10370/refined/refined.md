Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10370:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'refno' parameter in the `addcustind.php` file.
- User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the 'refno' parameter.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, which leads to the SQL injection.
- Lack of input validation: The application does not validate the user-supplied 'refno' parameter to ensure it conforms to expected formats.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive system control:** In severe cases, attackers can achieve comprehensive control over the system.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the systemâ€™s operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `refno` parameter in the `addcustind.php` file.
- The vulnerability is accessible remotely.
- No authentication is required to exploit it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `addcustind.php` file with a malicious SQL payload in the `refno` parameter.
- No special privileges or prior authentication to the system are required.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- Public exploit and proof-of-concept are available.
- The vulnerability can be located using Google Hacking with the search query `inurl:addcustind.php`.
- The vulnerability is present in Codezips Sales Management System version 1.0.
- Suggested remediation includes using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
- The vulnerability has been assigned to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1505.
