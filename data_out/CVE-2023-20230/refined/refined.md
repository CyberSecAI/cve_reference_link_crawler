- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in Cisco APIC when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy for policies outside the tenant boundaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco APIC, which does not properly enforce access controls for policies outside of tenant boundaries when multi-tenancy is implemented. Specifically, the system does not prevent users associated with one security domain from accessing policies created by users in another security domain. This is a CWE-284, Improper Access Control vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated, remote attacker can read, modify, or delete non-tenant policies (e.g., access policies) created by users associated with a different security domain on an affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within a restricted security domain. They need to be able to access the Cisco APIC remotely.
