# 2024-8-14 Snowflake JDBC Security Advisory

Moderate

[sfc-gh-ppandit](/sfc-gh-ppandit)
published
GHSA-f686-hw9c-xw9c
Oct 30, 2024

## Package

Snowflake JDBC Driver

## Affected versions

>= 3.2.6 & <= 3.19.1

## Patched versions

3.20.0 or later

## Description

### Impacted Products

Snowflake JDBC driver versions >= 3.2.6 & <= 3.19.1 are affected.

### Introduction

Snowflake recently identified an issue affecting JDBC drivers that can result in data being uploaded to an encrypted stage without the additional layer of protection provided by client side encryption. The issue, which affects only a subset of accounts hosted on Azure and GCP deployments (AWS deployments are not affected), manifests in instances where customers create a stage using a JDBC driver with the CLIENT\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY\_SIZE account parameter set to 256-bit rather than the default 128-bit. The data is still protected by TLS in transit and server side encryption at rest. This missed layer of the additional protection is not visible to the affected customers.

### Incorrect Security Setting Vulnerability

#### Description

Snowflake identified an incorrect security setting in Snowflake JDBC drivers. Snowflake has evaluated the severity of the issue and determined it was in medium range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.9.

#### Scenarios and attack vector(s)

Users of Snowflake JDBC drivers with accounts on Azure and GCP deployments who set the parameter CLIENT\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY\_SIZE = 256 were subject to this incorrect security setting vulnerability as it could result in data being uploaded to a stage without an additional layer for encryption.

#### Our response

On July 23, 2024, Snowflake discovered this vulnerability. On 10/28/2024, Snowflake released a patch in Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.20.0. The patch fixes the incorrect security setting.

#### Resolution

We strongly recommend users to upgrade to 3.20.0 or later versions as soon as possible.

### Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
