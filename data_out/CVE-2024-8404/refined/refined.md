Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-8404:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the `Web Print` hot folder functionality of PaperCut NG/MF, specifically on Windows servers. This vulnerability stems from the improper handling of symbolic links, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files the symbolic link points to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary file deletion:** The vulnerability allows for the deletion of files on the server that the attacker would not normally have access to.
*   **Improper handling of symbolic links:** The software doesn't properly validate or sanitize symbolic links, leading to the arbitrary file deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data loss/integrity:**  Arbitrary file deletion could lead to data loss or compromise the integrity of the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, deletion of critical system files could result in a denial-of-service scenario.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must have local login access to the Windows server hosting PaperCut NG/MF.
*   **Low-privilege code execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privilege code directly on the server.
*   **Symbolic link creation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link that points to the file they intend to delete via the vulnerable `Web Print` service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local login access to the Windows Server:** The attacker needs to be able to log in to the server, not just have network access.
*   **Ability to execute low-privilege code:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the server as a non-administrator user.
*   **Knowledge of PaperCut Web Print service and its hot folder structure.**
*   **Ability to create symbolic links in the file system.**

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects Windows servers with `Web Print` enabled.
*   This CVE is a split from CVE-2024-3037, to allow better attribution for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in PaperCut NG/MF version 23.0.9 and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Amol Dosanjh, Nicholas Zubrisky (@NZubrisky) and Michael DePlante (@izobashi) of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
