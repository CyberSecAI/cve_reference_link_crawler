## GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1083

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI handles integer calculations. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted EMF or WMF image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1083](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1083).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1083

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation.

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

#### Workarounds for GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1083

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry

  Customers who have applied [MS07-017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=84687) or customers using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To modify the key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  3. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD**.
  4. Type **DisableMetaFiles**, and then press ENTER.
  5. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.
  6. In the **Value data** box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Exit Registry Editor.
  8. Reboot the computer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Turning off processing ourning f metafiles may cause the appearance of software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause the software or system components to fail completely. It has been identified to have a potential significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.

  Examples include the following:

  + You cannot print on the computer.
  + Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.
  + Some scenarios that involve OLE rendering may break. Especially, it occurs when the object server is not active.

  For more information on this setting please read [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941835](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941835).

  **Managed Deployment Script:**

  1. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Disable\_MetaFiles.reg):

     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize]

     "DisableMetaFiles"=dword:00000001
  2. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an administrator (on Vista, an elevated administrator) command prompt:

     Regedit.exe /s Disable\_MetaFiles.reg
  3. Reboot the computer.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  3. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** on the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.
  4. In the **Value data** box, type **0**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Exit Registry Editor.
  6. Reboot the computer.

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
