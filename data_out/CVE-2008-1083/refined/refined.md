Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Graphics Device Interface (GDI) when processing malformed headers within Enhanced Metafile (EMF) or Windows Metafile (WMF) image files. Specifically, the `CreateDIBPatternBrushPt` GDI function is implicated in the heap overflow.
- An integer calculation error during processing of the malformed header leads to a heap chunk being under-allocated.  This undersized memory allocation later results in a heap overflow when the data is written to the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs due to incorrect handling of image file headers, specifically during the processing of metafiles by GDI.
- **Integer Calculation Error:** The root cause is an error in how GDI handles integer calculations when processing WMF and EMF headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.
- **System Compromise:** Exploitation can lead to a full system compromise under the credentials of the currently logged-in user.
- **Application Crashes:** In some cases, exploitation may cause applications like Internet Explorer or explorer.exe to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image Files:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by tricking users into opening specially crafted EMF or WMF image files. These files can be delivered via email, malicious websites, or embedded within other documents.
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious image file and convince the user to visit the site.
- **Email Attacks:** An attacker could send a malicious image file (or an office document with embedded malicious image) to the victim and convince them to open it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote and Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to convince the user to open or view a malicious image file (or a document containing one).
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to craft malicious WMF/EMF image files.

**Additional details:**
- Public reports confirm exploit code for this vulnerability was actively being developed.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows versions including Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2, Windows Server 2003, Vista and Server 2008.
- Internet Explorer (with default settings) can be an attack vector due to it's ability to launch the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer when a web page is viewed.
- A workaround involves disabling metafile processing, though this has a significant impact on system functionality.
- Patches are available from Microsoft (MS08-021) to address the vulnerability by modifying how GDI performs integer calculations to prevent the heap overflow.
