- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in MM service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-based buffer overflow exists due to insufficient bounds checking when writing to a buffer in the MM service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to local elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the MM service. The specific method of triggering is not given but it does not require user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have local access to the system where the vulnerable MediaTek chipset is being used to trigger the overflow. They need to execute code within the context of the affected MM service. No user interaction is required.
