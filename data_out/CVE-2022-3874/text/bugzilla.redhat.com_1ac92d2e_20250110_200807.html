| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2140577#c0)  ybuenos    2022-11-07 10:02:17 UTC  ``` In the Foreman component of Satellite, the ct_command and fcct_command settings allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the server. These commands are used to transpile CoreOS and Fedora CoreOS configurations in templates. Changing the command requires admin privileges on the Foreman instance.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2140577#c3)  ybuenos    2023-01-24 09:41:49 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2162972](show_bug.cgi?id=2162972 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Satellite/Foreman: Arbitrary code execution via Provisioning Settings") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2140577#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-19 13:13:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.13 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:5931 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5931](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5931)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2140577#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-20 18:43:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.12 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:5979 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5979](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5979)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2140577#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-08 14:16:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.14 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:6818 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6818](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A6818)   ``` |  |
