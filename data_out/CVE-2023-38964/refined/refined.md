Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient input validation of the `query` parameter within the search functionality of "Academy LMS 6.0". The application attempts to sanitize the input by checking for the presence of double quotes (`"`) and the string `script`, but this is easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application uses a weak and easily bypassed sanitization method. It only checks for the presence of double quotes (`"`) and the literal string `script`. This is inadequate to prevent XSS attacks.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input from the `query` parameter is directly reflected in the HTML output of the page without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page through the vulnerable `query` parameter.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive data displayed on the page or redirect the user to a malicious site.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker can inject code to alter the appearance of the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** It's possible to use the XSS vulnerability to redirect users to websites containing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable `query` parameter is part of a GET request, making it relatively easy to exploit via a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker only needs to understand how to craft a basic HTTP GET request to include a malicious payload in the `query` parameter.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges on the server are required to execute this attack, as it is a client-side attack that exploits the website's own vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to deliver URL:** The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted URL to the victim, typically via email, links, or other social engineering methods.

**Payload Example:**

The provided payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability was:
```
"><svg+onload=alert(1)>
```

This payload injects an SVG element into the HTML, which, upon loading, triggers the execution of the javascript function `alert(1)`, demonstrating a successful XSS attack.

**Additional notes:**

The provided images demonstrate the vulnerability. The first image shows the vulnerable code. The second image shows the reflection of a simple test string. The third image shows the successful execution of the XSS payload. The fourth image shows the source code and the injected payload within the response.
