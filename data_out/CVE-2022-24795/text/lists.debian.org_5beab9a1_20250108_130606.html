Package        : yajl
Version        : 2.1.0-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16516 CVE-2022-24795 CVE-2023-33460
Debian Bug     : 1040036

Multiple vulnerabilties have been found in yajl, a JSON parser / small
validating JSON generator# written in ANSI C, which potentially can
cause memory corruption or DoS.

The CVE-20117-16516 had been addressed already in DLA-3478, however the
fix has been found to be incomplete as it missed an additional memory
leak.  This update fixes that problem.

CVE-2017-16516

  When a crafted JSON file is supplied to yajl, the process might
  crash with a SIGABRT in the yajl_string_decode function in
  yajl_encode.c. This results potentially in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-24795

  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer
  overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing
  with large (~2GB) inputs.

CVE-2023-33460

  There's a memory leak in yajl 2.1.0 with use of yajl_tree_parse
  function, which potentially cause out-of-memory in server and cause
  crash.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.0-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your yajl packages.
