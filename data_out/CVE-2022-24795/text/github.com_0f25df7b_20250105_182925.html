# Reallocation bug can trigger heap memory corruption

Moderate

[brianmario](/brianmario)
published
GHSA-jj47-x69x-mxrm
Apr 5, 2022

## Package

bundler

yajl-ruby
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 1.4.2

## Patched versions

1.4.3

## Description

*NOTE: A previous patch, 1.4.2, fixed the heap memory issue, but could still lead to a DoS infinite loop. Please update to version 1.4.3*

The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl) contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs.

### Details

The [reallocation logic at yajl\_buf.c#L64](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/blob/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6/ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c#L64) may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk.

These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer.

Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption.

### Impact

We rate this as a moderate severity vulnerability which mostly impacts process availability as we believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution to be unlikely.

### Patches

Patched in yajl-ruby 1.4.3

### Workarounds

Avoid passing large inputs to YAJL

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
