Package        : burp
Version        : 2.1.32-2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16516 CVE-2022-24795 CVE-2023-33460
Debian Bug     : 1040036

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the version of yajl bundled
with burp, a simple cross-platform network BackUp and Restore Program.
yajl is a JSON parser and small validating JSON generator.

CVE-2017-16516

  When a crafted JSON file is supplied to yajl, the process might
  crash with a SIGABRT in the yajl_string_decode function in
  yajl_encode.c.  This potentially results in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-24795

  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer
  overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing
  with large (~2GB) inputs.

CVE-2023-33460

  There's a memory leak in yajl 2.1.0 with use of yajl_tree_parse
  function, which potentially cause the server to run out of memory and
  crash.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.32-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your burp packages.
