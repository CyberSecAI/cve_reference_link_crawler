{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ScreenConnect client can be tricked into trusting proxy configurations from non-administrative local users. The client attempts to use the proxy configurations of active user sessions when its configured proxy is not working. It saves the first working user proxy to its configuration file as the `DiscoveredProxyUri` value which will be used for subsequent connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The client does not properly validate proxy configurations, leading to implicit trust of user-provided proxies.",
       "The client prioritizes user-discovered proxy configurations over its own settings."
    ],
    "impact": "A non-privileged attacker with existing access to a system can perform Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) and Remote Code Execution (RCE) as 'NT AUTHORITY\\System' when chained with CVE-2023-47257. This occurs because the attacker can set a malicious proxy configuration for a local user and the ScreenConnect service will then use this malicious proxy.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to configure the proxy settings of a non-privileged user.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered when the ScreenConnect service attempts to connect to its relay server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to the target system and the ability to set proxy configurations for non-administrative user accounts."
  },
   "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is more severe when chained with CVE-2023-47257. The article provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerable code and exploitation process, including decompiled code snippets."
