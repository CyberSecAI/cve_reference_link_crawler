Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6969 (Note: While the CVE ID itself is a placeholder, the analysis is based on the vulnerability described in the provided content.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `get_patient_history.php` file of the SourceCodester Clinic's Patient Management System 1.0.
- The application directly uses the `patient_id` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization/parameterization of the `patient_id` parameter when constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, potentially including patient records, prescriptions, and other confidential data.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues and system instability.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might achieve a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `patient_id` parameter in the HTTP request sent to `/pms/ajax/get_patient_history.php`.
- **Malicious SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker injects malicious SQL queries through the `patient_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application to send malicious HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of SQL syntax:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious payloads.
- **No authentication required** as the vulnerability is within the page that fetches the data.
