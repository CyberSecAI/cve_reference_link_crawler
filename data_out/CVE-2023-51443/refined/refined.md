  "source": "github.com_65404729_20250111_204733.html",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the DTLS handshake phase when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. Sending a DTLS ClientHello message with an invalid CipherSuite from a different IP and port can cause a DTLS error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-703"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) on vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. The attack can continuously terminate new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network. An attacker can send crafted DTLS ClientHello messages to the FreeSWITCH server's media port from a different IP and port than the expected caller.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the FreeSWITCH server and be able to send UDP packets. No special privileges or user interaction is required."
  },
  "patch": {
    "patched_versions": ">= 1.10.11",
    "solution": "Upgrade FreeSWITCH to the latest version which includes the security fix. The implemented solution drops all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check."
  },
   "additional_information": {
    "attack_details": "An attacker sends a DTLS ClientHello with an invalid CipherSuite to FreeSWITCH's media port. If this message wins the race against the expected ClientHello from the caller, the media session and the call are terminated. This can be repeated continuously to prevent calls from being established.",
