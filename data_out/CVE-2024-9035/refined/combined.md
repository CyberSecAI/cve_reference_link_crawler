# Submit #411216: code-projects blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code V1.0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | code-projects blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code V1.0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'login.php' file of the 'Blood Bank Management System In PHP With Source Code' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "username" and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations. |
