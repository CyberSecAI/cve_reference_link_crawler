Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTML-safe strings within the `attrs_to_s` method of the `Rumble` module.  Specifically, the code was not escaping quotes within attributes, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. By allowing unescaped quotes in HTML attribute values, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By injecting malicious javascript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could provide data containing unescaped quotes within attribute values that are processed by the vulnerable `attrs_to_s` method.  Specifically, attribute values that are already marked as HTML-safe are passed through without escaping the quotes, allowing for the injection of malicious attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control over Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control data that gets used as attribute values within the application. This typically involves the ability to provide the data passed to the view through data structures such as hashes and arrays.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability was present because HTML-safe strings were not escaped.
- The fix involves ensuring that all double quotes (`"`) within attribute values are escaped as `&quot;` during rendering, even if the value is marked as HTML-safe.
- Additionally, the fix adds support for array attributes, where each value in the array is escaped before being rendered as a space-separated list within an HTML attribute.

**Code Changes:**
The following code changes were implemented to resolve the vulnerability.
   - In `lib/keynote/rumble.rb`, the `attrs_to_s` method was updated to correctly handle HTML-safe strings and array attributes by escaping double quotes.
   - In `spec/rumble_spec.rb`, a new test case (`test_array_attrs`) was added to ensure the correct handling of array attributes, and the test case `test_hash_data` was modified to include HTML-safe string.

The commit message `Always escape quotes in attributes; support array attrs` and the associated code changes in `lib/keynote/rumble.rb` and `spec/rumble_spec.rb` address the XSS vulnerability described in the commit message and demonstrates how the vulnerability was remediated and tested.
