This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Always escape quotes in attributes; support array attrs

```
The current behavior is to pass HTML-safe strings through unaltered, but
this can still cause an XSS vulnerability if the string has an unescaped
quote in it:

    [rails/rails@4394e90](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4394e9075189ee6031944491aecd64fb269cdf54)

I also added support for array attributes, since I noticed Rails does
it when I was copying their escaping code.
```
