- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'wpaft\_add\_meta\_textinput' function when processing image meta fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker with editor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an infected page, potentially leading to arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts into the image meta field via the 'wpaft\_add\_meta\_textinput' function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with at least editor-level permissions, in multi-site WordPress installations or in installations where unfiltered\_html is disabled.
