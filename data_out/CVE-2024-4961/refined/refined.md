Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities affecting D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities present in the web-based management interface of the D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers, specifically related to the handling of file uploads. These vulnerabilities allow for:
*   **Unrestricted file uploads:** The system does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files of arbitrary types. This can lead to the execution of malicious code on the router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Multiple reports indicate RCE vulnerabilities via various attack vectors like `webmailattach.md`, `importhtml.md`, `resmanage.php`, and  `cve.md` (multiple RCE vulnerabilities).
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The most common weakness is arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities in several PHP scripts:
    *   `/user/onlineuser.php`
	*   `licenseauthorization.php.php`
	*	`resmanage.php`
	*	`url.php`
	*	`urlblist.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete compromise of the router:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router, potentially giving them complete control.
*   **Data breaches:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the router or transmitted through it.
*   **Network compromise:** An attacker could use the compromised router to pivot to other devices on the same network.
*   **Malware deployment:** An attacker could upload and execute malware on the router to further their malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the D-Link routers using HTTP. Exploits are achieved by uploading malicious files to vulnerable PHP scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web interface of the affected D-Link router. This could be from the same local network or, if the management interface is exposed, over the internet.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of web vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, and may need to modify the exploit to be specific to the device or firmware version.
*   **No Authentication Required (In some cases):** It is implied that some of the vulnerabilities can be triggered without authentication, although that is not explicitly stated.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected models are DAR-7000 and DAR-8000, all hardware revisions.
*   These devices are EOL/EOS and no longer receive software updates and security patches from D-Link.
*   D-Link recommends that these devices be retired and replaced.

**Summary:**

The D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers have multiple vulnerabilities, mainly arbitrary file upload flaws and RCE vulnerabilities, that can be exploited by attackers to gain complete control of the devices. Because the devices are End-of-Life, there will be no patch.
