- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Church Content â€“ Sermons, Events and More Plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in user interacts with it (e.g., via a link or embedded content).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into initiating a request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress instance.
