- Root cause of vulnerability: Unrestricted delay setting in nGrinder.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the ability to set an unlimited delay, which can be manipulated by a remote attacker.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
- Attack vectors: Remote attacker manipulation of delay settings.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote network access to the nGrinder instance.
