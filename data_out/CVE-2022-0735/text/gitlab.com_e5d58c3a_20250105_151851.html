# JSON serialization of any Project model results in all Runner tokens being exposed through Quick Actions

This is a repeat of [gitlab-foss#59003 (closed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/59003 "JSON serialization of any Project model results in all Runner tokens being exposed through Quick Actions"), but with a minor change to reproduce. It now needs a note that isn't command-only.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a project
2. Create an issue
3. Write `some text\n/move <full path of any other project>` and click "Comment", a request to `/:namespace/:project/notes` is submitted
4. Observe the JSON response that is being returned, which contains the serialized Project model
