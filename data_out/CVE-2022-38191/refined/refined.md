- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTML injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper input sanitization allows for injection of HTML code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject HTML into some locations of the home application. This could potentially lead to defacement, phishing, or other malicious activities within the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, authenticated attacker crafts and injects malicious HTML code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Portal for ArcGIS application. They also need to convince a user to access the injected HTML through a crafted link or specific actions.
