- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password protection mechanism in Eaton easySoft software stores passwords insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A skilled adversary could retrieve the password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to project files and their modification.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through gaining access to the insecurely stored password within the project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a skilled adversary capable of retrieving the password from its insecure storage location within the project file. Access to the project file is also required.
