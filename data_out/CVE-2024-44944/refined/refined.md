{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The deletion of an expectation path in the netfilter connection tracking module does not use the `nf_expect_get_id()` helper function to calculate the expectation ID. Instead, it directly uses the memory address of the expectation object, leaking the least significant byte (LSB) of the address to user space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Type Confusion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leak kernel memory addresses, which can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially bypass security measures or elevate privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating netfilter conntrack expectations and observing the leaked LSB of the expectation object address.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local access with the ability to execute low-privileged code."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fixes": [
      "The fix involves using the `nf_expect_get_id()` helper function when deleting an expectation, to ensure the ID is calculated correctly instead of leaking the memory address of the expectation object.",
