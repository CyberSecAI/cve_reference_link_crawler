- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco IoT Control Center does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
