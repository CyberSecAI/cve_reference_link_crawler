- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The core nodes were not properly handling a failure mode in a third-party library, which led to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper error handling, specifically related to a race condition in a third-party library.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Core nodes can crash randomly. Although the crashed nodes recover quickly, a large-scale attack *could* disrupt the network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting a failure mode in a third-party library
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send specific requests over the network, and cause the race condition to occur in the vulnerable core node. No specific privileges or user interaction is needed.
