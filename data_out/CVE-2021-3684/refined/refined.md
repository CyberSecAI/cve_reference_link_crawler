Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3684:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Assisted Installer application for OpenShift was leaking the Image Pull Secret in plaintext within the installation logs generated during the Discovery ISO creation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Image pull secrets, which are used for authenticating and pulling container images from registries, were exposed in log files.
- **Plaintext Storage:** The secrets were stored in plain text, making them easily accessible if logs were compromised.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the leaked pull secrets could use them to pull container images from the registry as the associated user. This could allow unauthorized access to proprietary software or to inject malicious container images.
- The bugzilla entry states that an "authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user"

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the log files generated during Discovery ISO creation.
- An attacker could potentially obtain these logs by:
  - Compromising the system where the Assisted Installer is running
  - Intercepting the logs during transmission
  - Accessing a storage location where the logs are stored

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the log files generated during the installation process or have knowledge of where to find these log files.
- As mentioned in the bugzilla entry, the attacker needs to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the pull secret from the logs and marking the pull secret token as a secret, preventing it from being logged as an environment variable in the `assisted-installer-controller`.
-  The fix involved modifying the `assisted-installer-controller.go` file to mark the pull secret token as a secret, and the `ops.go` file to remove the pull secret from the logged output of commands and errors.
