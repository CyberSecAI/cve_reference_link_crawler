Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-2593**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient encoding of user-controlled input within the AMSS++ application. Specifically, the 'b_id' parameter in the `/amssplus/modules/book/main/bookdetail_group.php` script is not properly sanitized before being used in the application's output.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. The application fails to neutralize or encode special characters in the 'b_id' parameter, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's output. When a user with an active session views the manipulated page, the injected script will execute in their browser. This can lead to stealing user session cookies and potentially hijacking the user's account.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious code in the 'b_id' parameter of the `/amssplus/modules/book/main/bookdetail_group.php` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and needs to craft a malicious URL. The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user to click the malicious URL to trigger the XSS.
