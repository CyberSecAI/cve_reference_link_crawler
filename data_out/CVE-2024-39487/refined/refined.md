  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "In the `bond_option_arp_ip_targets_set()` function, if `newval->string` is an empty string, `newval->string+1` will point to the byte after the string, causing an out-of-bounds read when `strlen()` is called on it.",

        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A read of size 1 at an invalid address, which can cause a system crash or other unpredictable behavior. This is detected by KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer)",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Writing an empty string to the bonding driver's `arp_ip_targets` sysfs attribute."
