# Reflected XSS via request endpoints

## Package

CVAT

## Affected versions

2.16.0-2.18.0

## Patched versions

2.19.0

## Description

### Impact

If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a maliciously-constructed URL, they can initiate any API calls on that user's behalf. This gives the attacker temporary access to all data that the victim user has access to.

### Patches

Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.0 or a later version.

### Workarounds

N/A

### References

Fix commit: [0bf45fd](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/0bf45fd5de08a652dffbfb517318a64c2fdbc5cf)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
