# Reflected XSS via request endpoints

High

[SpecLad](/SpecLad)
published
GHSA-hp6c-f34j-qjj7
Sep 30, 2024

## Package

CVAT

## Affected versions

2.16.0-2.18.0

## Patched versions

2.19.0

## Description

### Impact

If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a maliciously-constructed URL, they can initiate any API calls on that user's behalf. This gives the attacker temporary access to all data that the victim user has access to.

### Patches

Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.0 or a later version.

### Workarounds

N/A

### References

Fix commit: [0bf45fd](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/0bf45fd5de08a652dffbfb517318a64c2fdbc5cf)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47064

```
When a view returns an `HttpResponseNotFound` object, the `Content-Type`
header is set to `text/html` by default. Therefore, including external data
(in this case, the request ID) in the output without any escaping or
validation leads to a vulnerability. If an attacker can trick a user into
following a malicious link, they can include HTML elements in the request ID
that execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser. That code
will be able to make requests to the CVAT API with the user's privileges.

The simplest fix for this is to not include variable data in the error
message, which is what I did.

In the long run, I think we need to get rid of these HTML responses,
since it doesn't make sense for a JSON API to return HTML.
