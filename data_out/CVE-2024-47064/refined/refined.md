Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inclusion of unsanitized user-controlled input (specifically, the request ID) in the HTML response of the `HttpResponseNotFound` object. When a request ID was not found, the application would return an HTML response including the user supplied ID without proper escaping or sanitization. Because the `Content-Type` header was set to `text/html` by default this allowed for HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By crafting a URL with a malicious request ID that includes HTML and Javascript code, an attacker could inject code into the error page returned to the user, and potentially execute arbitrary Javascript. This is a [CWE-81](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/81.html) vulnerability - Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary API Calls:** An attacker can execute arbitrary API calls on behalf of a logged-in user. This is achieved by injecting JavaScript that can make requests to the CVAT API using the user's established session and cookies.
*   **Data Access:** Attackers gain temporary access to all data the victim user has access to, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Constructed URLs:** The attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious request ID.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting the maliciously crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a URL:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL that includes malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the request ID parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking the malicious link. This may be done through methods like phishing emails, malicious links on other sites, etc.
