- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Delta Electronics CNCSoft-B versions 1.0.0.4 and prior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. The attack complexity is low. User interaction is required, as indicated by the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software. No privileges are required but user interaction is needed.
