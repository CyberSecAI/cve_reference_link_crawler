The LearnPress â€“ WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration due to a missing capability check on the 'register' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.6.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass disabled user registration to create a new account with the default role.
