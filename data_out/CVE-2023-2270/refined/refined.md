- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Netskope client service, running with NT\SYSTEM privileges, accepts network connections from localhost to initiate services and execute commands. The service uses a relative path to download and unzip configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of a relative path for downloading and unzipping configuration files allows local users to write arbitrary files in a location accessible to only higher privileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users can exploit this vulnerability to execute code with NT\SYSTEM privileges on the end machine.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user can write arbitrary files to a privileged location by leveraging the relative path used by the Netskope client service when downloading and unzipping configuration files via a local connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local user access to the machine running the vulnerable Netskope client.
