In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aio: Fix null ptr deref in aio_complete() wakeup

list_del_init_careful() needs to be the last access to the wait queue
entry - it effectively unlocks access.

Previously, finish_wait() would see the empty list head and skip taking
the lock, and then we'd return - but the completion path would still
attempt to do the wakeup after the task_struct pointer had been
overwritten.
