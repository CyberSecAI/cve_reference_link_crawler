- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient state management within the Siri component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the improper management of Siri's state when the device is locked, which allows for unauthorized access to sensitive user data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to a locked device can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive user data by using Siri.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the locked device and the ability to interact with Siri.
