**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of restrictions on classes that can be restored when parsing `.rdoc_options` as a YAML file, and when loading the documentation cache. This allows for object injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted object deserialization/injection when parsing `.rdoc_options` YAML files.
- Unrestricted object deserialization/injection when loading the documentation cache.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted `.rdoc_options` file.
- Crafted documentation cache.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to either provide a malicious `.rdoc_options` file or a crafted documentation cache that the vulnerable RDoc gem will process.
