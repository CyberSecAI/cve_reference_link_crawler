# USN-5564-1: Linux kernel (Intel IoTG) vulnerabilities

10 August 2022

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=jammy)

## Packages

* [linux-intel-iotg](/security/cves?package=linux-intel-iotg) - Linux kernel for Intel IoT platforms

## Details

Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter

before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2022-2588](/security/CVE-2022-2588))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table,

leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2022-2586](/security/CVE-2022-2586))

It was discovered that the implementation of POSIX timers in the Linux

kernel did not properly clean up timers in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-2585](/security/CVE-2022-2585))

It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF\_BTF\_LOAD commands. A

privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-0500](/security/CVE-2022-0500))

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-1652](/security/CVE-2022-1652))

It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a

use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2022-1679](/security/CVE-2022-1679))

It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some

situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker

could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-1734](/security/CVE-2022-1734))

Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in

some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) in the host OS. ([CVE-2022-1789](/security/CVE-2022-1789))

Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux

kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-1974](/security/CVE-2022-1974))

Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic

context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2022-1975](/security/CVE-2022-1975))

Felix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-28893](/security/CVE-2022-28893))

Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64

processors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return

instructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2022-29900](/security/CVE-2022-29900))

Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64

processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch

target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local

attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2022-29901](/security/CVE-2022-29901))

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a

race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-33981](/security/CVE-2022-33981))

Arthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this

to escalate privileges in certain situations. ([CVE-2022-34918](/security/CVE-2022-34918))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 22.04

* [linux-image-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-intel-iotg)
  -
  [5.15.0-1013.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-intel-iotg/5.15.0-1013.17)
* [linux-image-intel-iotg](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-intel-iotg)
  -
  [5.15.0.1013.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-intel-iotg/5.15.0.1013.13)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
