Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27205:

**CVE-2022-27205: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Extended Choice Parameter Plugin allow SSRF**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Extended Choice Parameter Plugin does not perform proper permission checks in its form validation methods and does not require POST requests for these methods.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** Form validation methods lack proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger them.
    *   **CSRF:** Form validation methods do not require POST requests, leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL, achieving Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker leverages the lack of permission checks to trigger the vulnerable form validation methods.
    *   The attacker crafts a request that exploits the missing POST request requirement, leading to a CSRF attack.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker can influence the URL that the Jenkins server connects to.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the Extended Choice Parameter Plugin, version 346.vd87693c5a_86c and earlier.
*   No fix is available as of the publication of the advisory.
*   This vulnerability is related to SECURITY-1350 (CSRF) as they both stem from the same issue within the plugin.
