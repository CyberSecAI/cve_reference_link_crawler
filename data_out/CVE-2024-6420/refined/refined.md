- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to prevent redirects to the login page via the `auth_redirect` WordPress function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Sensitive data disclosure of the hidden login page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can access the hidden login page, potentially leading to further attacks such as brute-forcing login credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by using a crafted URL that leverages the `auth_redirect` function, such as through a GravityForms redirect.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability, requiring no special privileges or access.
