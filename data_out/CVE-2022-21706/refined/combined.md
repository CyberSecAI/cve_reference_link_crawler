CVE-2022-21706: Prevent use of multiuse invites to join other orgs.

```
The codepaths for joining an organization via a multi-use invitation
(accounts_home_from_multiuse_invite and maybe_send_to_registration)
weren't validating whether
the organization the invite was generated for matches the organization
the user attempts to join - potentially allowing an attacker with access
to organization A to generate a multi-use invite and use it to join
organization B within the same deployment, that they shouldn't have
access to.

# Zulip Cloud security vulnerability with reusable invitation links

  [![](/_astro/alex.rLi04l3I_ZS8spS.webp)](author/alex/)  [Alex Vandiver](author/alex/)   Feb 25, 2022 • 2 min read

An internal investigation recently uncovered a vulnerability (identified as
CVE-2022-21706) in Zulip’s invitation links. Specifically, a
[reusable invitation link](https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users#send-invitations)
could be used to join a different organization than the one it was created for.
As a result, there was a potential for users to join any organization without an
invitation (and bypassing
[domain restrictions](https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users#enable-email-signup)).

This vulnerability was discovered by the Zulip security team, and has now been
fixed for all Zulip Cloud organizations. It has been present since the first
reusable invitation links were created in October 2017, though only a handful of
such links existed before the menu option for creating them was introduced in
February 2019.

It was also possible to use this vulnerability to join an organization with
elevated permissions (e.g. in a moderator or administrator role). However, we
are confident that there were no instances of this happening on Zulip Cloud.

## Was my organization was affected by this vulnerability?

We have performed an extensive examination of all Zulip Cloud audit logs, and
have identified 4 instances where it looks like users may have accidentally
exploited this vulnerability. These users joined an organization for which they
had a legitimate invite by accidentally using a *second* invitation not from
that organization.

**Our investigation did not find any evidence that this vulnerability was ever
discovered by someone outside the Zulip security team, or exploited on
purpose.** However, we have contacted all organizations for which our audit
cannot prove conclusively that they were not affected. If you receive an email
from us and your organization was invite-only at any point, we recommend
reviewing the attached list of users to confirm that everything is as expected.

**If you administer a Zulip Cloud organization and do not receive an email from
us today, your organization was not affected by this vulnerability.**

## Parting thoughts

For self-hosted installations of Zulip, this vulnerability is fixed in the Zulip
4.10 release and discussed in the
[release blog post](2022/02/25/zulip-server-4-10-security-release/). Most
self-hosted Zulip servers are not affected because they only host a single
organization.

On behalf of Kandra Labs, I’d like to apologize for this security vulnerability.
Keeping data that users have entrusted to us safe is the single most important
thing we do, and we consider this category of incident unacceptable.

If you have any questions or concerns, or discover any unexpected accounts,
please reach out to us at security@zulip.com.

# Multi-use invitations can grant access to other organizations

High

[alexmv](/alexmv)
published
GHSA-6xmj-2wcm-p2jc
Feb 25, 2022

## Package

Zulip Server
(Application)

## Affected versions

> 2.0.0, < 4.10

## Patched versions

4.10

## Description

### Impact

Zulip Server version 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to insufficient access control with multi-use invitations. A Zulip Server deployment which hosts multiple organizations is vulnerable to an attack where an invitation created in one organization (potentially as a role with elevated permissions) can be used to join any other organization. This bypasses any restrictions on required domains of users' email addresses, may be used to gain access to organizations which are only accessible by invitation, and may be used to gain access with elevated privileges.

This is a different vulnerability than [CVE-2017-0910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6r66-34x7-46rg "CVE-2017-0910"), which only affected single-use invitation links.

### Patches

[88917019f03860609114082cdc0f31a561503f9e](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/88917019f03860609114082cdc0f31a561503f9e) closed the vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Zulip Server 4.10 security release

  [![](/_astro/alex.rLi04l3I_ZS8spS.webp)](author/alex/)  [Alex Vandiver](author/alex/)   Feb 25, 2022 • 3 min read

We released Zulip Server 4.10 today! This is a security release, containing
important security fixes, as well as important cherry-picked bug fixes, since
Zulip Server 4.9.

## Upgrading

We strongly recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See
the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available
on [chat.zulip.org](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

## Reminder: upgrade your host operating system

As a reminder,
[we have deprecated](2021/12/01/zulip-server-4-8-security-release/) support for
Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, because the upstream vendor no longer provides security
support for important Zulip dependencies. Specifically, Ubuntu 18.04 remains
supported in this release and will be supported in the rest of the Zulip Server
4.x series, but will not be supported in the upcoming Zulip Server 5.0 release.

We recommend upgrading any Zulip servers you manage which are running on Ubuntu
18.04. See our
[OS upgrade documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system)
for how to correctly upgrade a Zulip server.

## Notable changes:

* [CVE-2022-21706](2022/02/25/zulip-server-4-10-security-release/#cve-2022-21706):
  Reusable invitation links could be improperly used for other organizations.
* CVE-2021-3967: Enforce that regenerating an API key must be done with an API
  key, not a cookie. Thanks to [nhiephon](https://twitter.com/_nhiephon) for
  their responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.
* Fixed a bug with the `reindex-textual-data` tool, where it would sometimes
  fail to find the libraries it needed.
* Pin PostgreSQL to 10.19, 11.14, 12.9, 13.5 or 14.1 to avoid a regression which
  caused deploys with PGroonga enabled to unpredictably fail database queries
  with the error `variable not found in subplan target list`.
* Fix ARM64 support; however, the wal-g binary is
  [not yet supported on ARM64](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21070).

## CVE-2022-21706

An internal investigation recently uncovered a vulnerability in Zulip’s
invitation links. Specifically, a
[reusable invitation link](https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users#send-invitations)
could be used to join a different organization than the one it was created for.
As a result, there was a potential for users to join an organization without an
invitation (including bypassing
[domain restrictions](https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users#enable-email-signup)),
or to incorrectly obtain elevated permissions (e.g. a moderator or admin role).

This issue only affects installations like
[Zulip Cloud](2022/02/25/zulip-cloud-invitation-vulnerability/) that host
multiple Zulip organizations; the vast majority of self-hosted installations
only host a single Zulip organization and are not affected.

It is possible for someone with expertise on the Zulip database and logging
format to determine whether this vulnerability was used to gain improper access
on a system. Customers with a Zulip support contract may request such assistance
by contacting us at security@zulip.com. Our
investigation of Zulip Cloud logs has determined that it is unlikely that this
vulnerability was actively exploited prior to this disclosure.
