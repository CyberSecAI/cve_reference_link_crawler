Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-45141:

**Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, meaning it can write data to memory locations outside of the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This allows an attacker to potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring local access to the system. The attack complexity is low (AC:L). No privileges are required (PR:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R). The scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path on the target system. This likely involves a user opening or processing a specially crafted file. The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, which is considered high, indicating its severity.
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Substance 3D Stager version 3.0.3 and earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability is patched in Adobe Substance 3D Stager version 3.0.4.
