{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of an `OPENSSLDIR` variable by the McAfee Agent that points to a location where an unprivileged Windows user can place files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Privilege escalation vulnerability. The `OPENSSLDIR` variable is set to a directory writable by unprivileged users, allowing them to place a malicious openssl.cnf file. The McAfee Agent's privileged service then utilizes this OpenSSL component, loading the malicious file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file in the vulnerable directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unprivileged user places a malicious `openssl.cnf` file in the directory specified by the `OPENSSLDIR` variable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user on a Windows system with a vulnerable version of the McAfee Agent installed. They must be able to write to the directory specified by `OPENSSLDIR`."
