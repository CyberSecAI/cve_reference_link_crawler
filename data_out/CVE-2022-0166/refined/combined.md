## McAfee Agent for Windows is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to OPENSSLDIR location

#### Vulnerability Note VU#287178

Original Release Date: 2022-01-20 | Last Revised: 2022-01-20

---

### Overview

McAfee Agent contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the use of an `OPENSSLDIR` variable that specifies a location where an unprivileged Windows user may be able to place files.

### Description

**CVE-2022-0166**

McAfee Agent, which comes with various McAfee products such as McAfee Endpoint Security, includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory that my be controllable by an unprivileged user on Windows. McAfee Agent contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. A user who can place a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file at an appropriate path may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` in a location used by McAfee Agent, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable McAfee Agent software installed.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

This vulnerability is [addressed](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10378) in McAfee Agent version 5.7.5.
