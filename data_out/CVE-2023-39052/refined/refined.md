- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mini-app 'Earthgarden_waiting' on Line exposes the 'client secret' in the response of a request to `/userEntry`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of a critical credential (client secret) on the client-side.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can obtain the channel access token using the exposed client secret. This token allows them to broadcast malicious messages to users of the mini-app. These messages can contain malicious links, fraud information, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** Simply by opening the mini-app 'Earthgarden_waiting' in the Line app. The client secret is revealed in the response to the `/userEntry` request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to have Line installed and open the vulnerable mini-app 'Earthgarden_waiting'. No special access or position is required.
