An issue was discovered in the Agent in Delinea Privilege Manager (formerly Thycotic Privilege Manager) before 12.0.1096 on Windows. Sometimes, a non-administrator user can copy a crafted DLL file to a temporary directory (used by .NET Shadow Copies) such that privilege escalation can occur if the core agent service loads that file.
