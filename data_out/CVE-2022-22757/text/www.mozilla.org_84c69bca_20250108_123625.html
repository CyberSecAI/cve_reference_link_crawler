Fixed in

* Firefox 97

#### [#CVE-2022-22753: Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM on Windows via Maintenance Service](#CVE-2022-22753)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use bug existed in the Maintenance (Updater) Service that could be abused to grant Users write access to an arbitrary directory. This could have been used to escalate to SYSTEM access.
*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2022-22754: Extensions could have bypassed permission confirmation during update](#CVE-2022-22754)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
high
##### Description

If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.

* [Bug 1750565](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750565)

#### [#CVE-2022-22755: XSL could have allowed JavaScript execution after a tab was closed](#CVE-2022-22755)

Reporter
Jack Wrenn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was closed.

#### [#CVE-2022-22756: Drag and dropping an image could have resulted in the dropped object being an executable](#CVE-2022-22756)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user clicked on it.

* [Bug 1317873](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1317873)

#### [#CVE-2022-22757: Remote Agent did not prevent local websites from connecting](#CVE-2022-22757)

Reporter
James Graham
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it.
*This bug only affected Firefox when WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1720098](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1720098)

#### [#CVE-2022-22758: tel: links could have sent USSD codes to the dialer on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2022-22758)

Reporter
Kirtikumar Anandrao Ramchandani, Patrick Walker & Eric Lawrence
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When clicking on a tel: link, USSD codes, specified after a `*` character, would be included in the phone number. On certain phones, or on certain carriers, if the number was dialed this could perform actions on a user's account, similar to a cross-site request forgery attack.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1728742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1728742)

#### [#CVE-2022-22759: Sandboxed iframes could have executed script if the parent appended elements](#CVE-2022-22759)

Reporter
Johan Carlsson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a document created a sandboxed iframe without `allow-scripts`, and subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox.

##### References

* [Bug 1739957](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1739957)

#### [#CVE-2022-22760: Cross-Origin responses could be distinguished between script and non-script content-types](#CVE-2022-22760)

Reporter
Luan Herrera
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between `application/javascript` responses and non-script responses. This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin.

##### References

* [Bug 1740985](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1740985)
* [Bug 1748503](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1748503)

Reporter
Mart Gil Robles (Mart at FlowCrypt)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content Security Policy.

* [Bug 1745566](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1745566)

#### [#CVE-2022-22762: JavaScript Dialogs could have been displayed over other domains on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2022-22762)

Reporter
James Lee
Impact
low
##### Description

Under certain circumstances, a JavaScript alert (or prompt) could have been shown while another website was displayed underneath it. This could have been abused to trick the user.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2022-22764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 97 and Firefox ESR 91.6](#CVE-2022-22764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Sebastian Hengst, Randell Jesup, Luan Herrera, Lars T Hansen, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 96.
