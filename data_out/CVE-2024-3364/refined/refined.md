Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3364 (Although not explicitly stated, the content clearly refers to a vulnerability and, based on the title, should relate to CVE-2024-3364.)

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of the `id` parameter in the `admin/books/index.php` page of the Online Library System. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `admin/books/index.php` page.
- The `id` parameter is vulnerable to injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `id` parameter.
- The victim must visit the malicious URL for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL.
- No specific privileged access is required on the server side to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` in `admin/books/index.php`.
- **Payload:** `?id="> <script>alert(1)</script>`. This payload will execute a simple JavaScript alert, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in version 1.0 of the Online Library System.
- The software is a PHP/MySQL web application.
- The provided links in the content point to a proof-of-concept demonstration and payload example.
- The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for malicious code execution within user browsers.
