```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded telnet account with default credentials in Lutron's integration protocol, used for remote support but not able to be disabled by the customer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded credentials, Lack of authentication controls, Insecure remote access",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full control over the affected systems via telnet, allowing them to manipulate the electrical installation, including lighting, shades, and other connected devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access via Telnet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Lutron devices, and knowledge of the hardcoded credentials for the affected protocols (HomeWorks QS, radioRA 2, or stanza). There are potentially 7000-8000 vulnerable devices exposed on the internet that are publicly accessible."
