- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in Cortex XSOAR software when generating reports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Authenticated users in non-Read-Only groups can generate an email report containing summary information about all incidents, including incidents they do not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unauthorized disclosure of summary information about all incidents in the Cortex XSOAR instance. An attacker can learn information about incidents they are not authorized to see.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in a non-read-only group within Cortex XSOAR.
