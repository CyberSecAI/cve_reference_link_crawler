Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the mass update functionality in Tuleap's tracker system. When performing a mass update on artifacts, the "Permissions on Artifact" field was not correctly handled. Specifically, the `fetchSubmitValueMasschange` method in `Tracker_FormElement_Field_PermissionsOnArtifact.php` was not including logic to preserve existing permissions when the user intended not to modify them. This resulted in the mass update process clearing the permissions on artifacts if the mass update was triggered, even when the intention was not to modify the permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Broken Access Control:** The core vulnerability is a broken access control issue. The mass update operation unintentionally removed existing permission settings on the artifact, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive information.
-   **Incorrect Handling of Mass Updates:** The `fetchSubmitValueMasschange` method was not designed to retain existing data, leading to the loss of permissions during the mass update process.
-   **Lack of Specific "Unchanged" Value for Permissions:** Unlike other field types, the "Permissions on Artifact" field lacked a mechanism to specify when the permissions should remain unmodified during a mass update.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Users with read access to a tracker might gain access to information they were previously restricted from if mass update is used on the artifacts.
-   **Loss of Data Integrity:** The mass update clears permissions on artifacts, this can be considered a loss of integrity since the permissions data was modified unintentionally.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered through the mass update functionality within the Tuleap tracker system.
-   An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by:
    1. Gaining read access to a tracker that uses the "Permissions on Artifact" field.
    2. Triggering a mass update operation, even without intending to change the artifact permissions, which would clear the artifact permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges (read access) to the tracker to initiate mass updates, meaning that regular users of the tracker with read privileges could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trigger a mass update operation by using the UI.

**Mitigation:**

The fix involves the following:

*   **Introduce a checkbox:** A checkbox was added to the mass update UI to allow users to specify whether to update the permission field during a mass update operation.
*   **Modify the `fetchSubmitValueMasschange` method:** The `fetchSubmitValueMasschange` method in `Tracker_FormElement_Field_PermissionsOnArtifact.php` was modified to include the new checkbox logic to avoid clearing the permissions if it is not explicitly selected by the user.
*   **Add logic to `MasschangeDataValueExtractor`:** Logic was added to the `MasschangeDataValueExtractor` class to check the new "do\_mass\_update" flag, ensuring that permissions are only modified if the user indicates they should be updated during a mass update.
*   **JavaScript modifications:** Updates were made to `TrackerFormElementFieldPermissions.js` to manage the enabling/disabling of permission fields based on whether the mass update checkbox is checked.

**CVE Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-25130
