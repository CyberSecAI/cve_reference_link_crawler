Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-0831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an issue in HashiCorp Vault where the `log_raw` option for audit devices is not applied correctly. When `log_raw` is enabled for one audit device, it inadvertently applies to *all* audit devices, including those that are not intended to log raw (unhashed) sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect scope of `log_raw`:** The primary weakness is that the `log_raw` setting, which should be specific to a single audit device, is applied globally.
- **Sensitive data exposure:**  This leads to a situation where sensitive information intended to be hashed might be logged in clear text in audit logs where it should not be.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Disclosure of sensitive information:** Successful exploitation leads to the potential exposure of sensitive data that would otherwise be protected by hashing. This could include passwords, API keys, and other sensitive data processed by Vault.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Configuration of audit devices:** An attacker with the ability to configure audit devices within Vault could enable `log_raw` on one audit device, thereby causing sensitive data to be logged in plaintext to other audit devices.
- **Internal threat:**  A malicious insider with access to Vault configuration could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have sufficient privileges within Vault to configure audit devices. This generally requires administrative access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Vault and Vault Enterprise versions 1.15.0 through 1.15.4.
- It is fixed in version 1.15.5.
- NetApp products that use vulnerable versions of HashiCorp Vault Enterprise are also affected.
- The NetApp advisory notes that the vulnerability has been publicly discussed.
- NetApp lists many products that are not affected by this vulnerability

This vulnerability is rated as MEDIUM severity with a CVSS score of 6.5.
