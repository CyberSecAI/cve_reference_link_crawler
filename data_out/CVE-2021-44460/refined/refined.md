Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-44460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in Odoo Community and Enterprise editions allows deactivated user accounts to still access the system via crafted RPC requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Deactivated user accounts were not fully restricted from accessing the system's API.
*   The system failed to properly invalidate API access for deactivated user accounts.
*   Lack of proper access control enforcement on the API level for deactivated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Deactivated users, such as former employees, could bypass login restrictions and potentially access recent information.
*   Attackers can abuse the still-valid permissions associated with a deactivated account.
*   Potential for unauthorized data access (confidentiality breach) and modification (integrity breach).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network exploitable (remote).
*   Crafted RPC requests to the Odoo API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have a deactivated user account (i.e. credentials of a deactivated user) within the Odoo system.
*   The attacker must be able to craft RPC requests to interact with the Odoo API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Odoo versions 13.0 and earlier, both Community and Enterprise Editions.
*   A CVSS v3 score of 7.4 (High) with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N` indicates a significant risk.
*   The vulnerability is considered network exploitable.
*   The complexity of exploitation is considered high (AC:H) because crafting RPC requests would require specialized skills.
*   Odoo was not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild at the time of the report.
*   The provided content includes a fix, which involves updating Odoo to the latest version or applying specific patches.
