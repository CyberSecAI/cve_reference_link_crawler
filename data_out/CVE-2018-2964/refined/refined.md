Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unspecified flaw within the Deployment component of the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK). This issue affects Java SE versions 8u172 and 10.0.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is within the Java Deployment component. The specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed beyond it being related to "Deployment." The vulnerability may allow for the execution of untrusted code if the Java sandbox is not properly in place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
   - A takeover of the Java process.
   - Unauthorized modification of data accessible to the Java process.
   - Unauthorized reading of data accessible to the Java process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through network access where a malicious actor can leverage the deployment component.
 Specifically:
   -  Exploitation typically occurs in client environments that run sandboxed Java Web Start applications or applets loading untrusted code from the internet, as stated in the Oracle advisory.
   - While less common, server deployments that load and run only trusted code are not typically affected by this vulnerability. However, other attack vectors such as web services are also mentioned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
 - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
  -  They must be able to supply data to the vulnerable Deployment component within the targeted Java environment, either through typical client-side scenarios or less common server scenarios that might involve untrusted web service data.
 - In scenarios where the target is a client application, the user must interact with a malicious java application (e.g. via web browser).
 - The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the Java Deployment component.

**Additional Notes:**

- The NetApp advisory indicates that the vulnerability could lead to a complete takeover of Java, a partial denial of service, or unauthorized data access.
- The Red Hat advisory indicates that this vulnerability is fixed in Oracle JDK 8u181 and 10.0.2.
- The Oracle advisory provides more details on which products are affected and provides specific update and patch information.

This information is more specific than the standard CVE description, which only states it's an unspecified vulnerability in the deployment component.
