- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error occurs when an SSH session is established on Cisco ASA Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the SSH server implementation of Cisco ASA software when handling crafted SSH messages. Specifically, it's a resource exhaustion issue due to the logic flaw.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the SSH server. This prevents new SSH connections to the device, though existing connections remain functional. The device requires a manual reboot to recover the SSH service. User traffic isn't impacted, and remote management using applications such as Cisco ASDM remains possible.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending specially crafted SSH messages to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the SSH port on a vulnerable Cisco ASA device. No authentication is required.
