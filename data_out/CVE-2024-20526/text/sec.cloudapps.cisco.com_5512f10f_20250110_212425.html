This vulnerability is due to a logic error when an SSH session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However, user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssh-dos-eEDWu5RM>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected devices that were running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.4.67, 9.16.4.70, 9.18.4.40, or 9.20.3 if they had SSH enabled and were configured to use the proprietary ASA SSH stack.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Device Configuration The SSH server is not enabled by default. The SSH server is enabled when the administrator allows SSH access from at least one host using the **ssh *{ ip\_address mask | ipv6\_address/prefix } interface*** command*.*  If a device is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.4.67 or 9.16.4.70 and has SSH enabled, it is affected by this vulnerability. If the device is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.18.4.40 or 9.20.3, it is affected by this vulnerability only if the **show running-config** command returns **no ssh stack ciscossh**, as shown in the following example:  ```   asa# show running-config ssh | include stackno ssh stack ciscossh   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software   + Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software  Indicators of Compromise  * Cisco ASA Software allows a maximum of five concurrent SSH connections per context. Once this limit is reached, no more connections are allowed. To determine the current number of active SSH sessions on a device, use the **show resource usage** command and inspect the **SSH Server** row. If the **Current** numberis one more than the **Limit**, as shown in the following example, and this does not clear for a period of time, the device may have been exploited by this vulnerability:  ```   asa# show resource usageResource                 Current        Peak      Limit        Denied ContextSSH Server                     6           6          5             0 SystemASDM                           0           4         30             0 SystemSyslogs [rate]                18        1536        N/A             0 SystemConns                       8547       32540     500000             0 System   ```  The device must be rebooted manually to clear this condition. Administrators could use SSH in another context or access the console port, but this is not always possible.  Workarounds  * There is no workaround for this vulnerability for devices that are running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.4.67 or 9.16.4.70.  For devices that are running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.18.4.40 or 9.20.3, use the **ssh stack ciscossh** CLI command to configure the device to use the CiscoSSH stack, which is not affected by this vulnerability. For more information about implementing this command, see the [ssh stack ciscossh](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-cli-reference/S/asa-command-ref-S/so-st-commands.html#wp8411317820) section of *Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series Command Reference*.  While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
