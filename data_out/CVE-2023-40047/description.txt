In WS_FTP Server version prior to 8.8.2, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in WS_FTP Server's Management module.  An attacker with administrative privileges could import a SSL certificate with malicious attributes containing cross-site scripting payloads.  Once the cross-site scripting payload is successfully stored,  an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to target WS_FTP Server admins with a specialized payload which results in the execution of malicious JavaScript within the context of the victims browser.
