{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Netflix Hollow writes to a local temporary directory before validating the permissions on it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application creates temporary directories without proper permission checks. Additionally, an insecure source of randomness is used, allowing file names to be deterministically calculated.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local filesystem access can pre-create the temporary directory with wide permissions. They can then read or modify any files written there by the Hollow process, leading to potential information disclosure or data modification.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local filesystem access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create directories and set permissions on the local filesystem where the Hollow process runs."
