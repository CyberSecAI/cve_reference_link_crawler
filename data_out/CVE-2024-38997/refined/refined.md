Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of vulnerable functions `extendDefaults` and `parse` within the `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` library. These functions do not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject the `__proto__` property into objects, thereby modifying the base `Object.prototype`.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is a prototype pollution vulnerability. By manipulating the `__proto__` property of the input passed to `extendDefaults` and `parse`, an attacker can modify the properties of all objects inheriting from `Object.prototype`.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts including:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): By modifying critical prototype properties, the application might malfunction or crash.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): If the application uses properties from the polluted prototype in a way that can be controlled by the attacker, RCE may be possible.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Depending on the context and usage of the prototype, it might be possible to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to XSS.

*   **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable `extendDefaults` and `parse` functions. By passing a specially crafted JSON payload containing `__proto__` as a key to these functions, an attacker can modify the prototype chain.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to control the input being passed to the vulnerable `extendDefaults` or `parse` functions within the `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` library. This might involve controlling user input, data retrieved from external sources, or any other way to manipulate the arguments to those functions.

**Additional Details from Content**:

*   The advisory specifies the vulnerable package: `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` version <= `0.0.2`.
*   It provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how the `__proto__` property can be used to pollute the prototype, adding a "test" property to `Object.prototype`.
*   The PoC shows that even a try-catch block will not prevent prototype pollution through the vulnerable functions.
*   The provided content includes the advisory markdown file that will be available for download.
