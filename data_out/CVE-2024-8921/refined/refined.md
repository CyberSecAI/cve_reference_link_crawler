### Summary
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Zita Elementor Site Library WordPress plugin, specifically in versions 1.6.3 and earlier. This vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of SVG file uploads. An authenticated attacker with Author-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user accesses the malicious SVG file.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads within the Zita Elementor Site Library plugin. This allows an attacker to embed malicious scripts directly into the SVG file.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin does not sanitize SVG files, allowing for the storage of malicious scripts.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the contents of uploaded SVG files.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the output of uploaded SVG files, resulting in the execution of the injected scripts in the browser.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of users viewing the malicious SVG file.
- **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, etc.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** Attackers could potentially gain access to admin accounts if an administrator views the malicious SVG.

### Attack vectors
- **SVG File Upload:** The attack vector is through the upload functionality of the WordPress plugin, which allows users with Author-level access and above to upload SVG files.
- **Malicious SVG Content:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Author-level access.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the media library.
