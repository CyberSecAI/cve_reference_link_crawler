## Package

docker

ghcr.io/librespeed/speedtest
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

>= 5.2.5, <= 5.3.0

5.3.1

## Description

### Summary

Missing neutralization of the ISP information in a speedtest result and an incorrect `Content-Type` HTTP header in the JSON API leads to stored Cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### Details

The `processedString` field in the `ispinfo` parameter is missing neutralization. It is stored when a user submits a speedtest result to the telemetry API (`results/telemetry.php`) and returned in the JSON API (`results/json.php`). The JSON API also doesn't set `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header.

This vulnerability has been introduced in [3937b94](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/commit/3937b940e80b734acae36cd41a2a31819593e728).

### PoC

1. Start Librespeed with telemetry enabled: `docker run -it -p 80:80 -e TELEMETRY=true ghcr.io/librespeed/speedtest`
2. Send an arbitrarily crafted speedtest result: `curl "http://localhost/results/telemetry.php" --data 'ispinfo={"processedString":"foo - bar <body onpageshow=alert`XSS`>"}&dl=1&ul=1&ping=1&jitter=1&log=&extra='`
3. Open JSON endpoint with speedtest ID from above, e.g. `http://localhost/results/json.php?id=1`

### Impact

This vulnerability affects LibreSpeed speedtest instances running version 5.2.5 or higher and have telemetry enabled.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
