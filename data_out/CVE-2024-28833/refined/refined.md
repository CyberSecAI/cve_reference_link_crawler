- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that prior to the fix, failures in two-factor authentication (2FA) did not contribute to the account lockout mechanism. This allowed for unlimited attempts at 2FA without triggering a lockout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness was the lack of integration between 2FA failure attempts and the account lockout system. This allowed an attacker to attempt brute-force attacks on 2FA without triggering the standard security measures designed to prevent such attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The primary impact was the potential bypass of 2FA protections. An attacker could leverage the lack of lockout enforcement on 2FA to brute-force a user's 2FA credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring no user interaction (UI:N). The attack involves sending multiple failed 2FA authentication requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires no special privileges or position (PR:N). The attacker needs the target user's credentials and the ability to send network requests to the target system. The attacker requires knowledge of the target's username and can attempt to bypass 2FA.
