Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper user input validation for the `user_email` parameter in the `index.php` file of the "Bakery Online Ordering System Using PHP and MySQL Database" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses the `user_email` parameter in SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive system control:** Attackers may gain control over the system.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers could cause the application or service to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The `user_email` parameter is injected via a POST request to `index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can manipulate the `user_email` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Bakery Online Ordering System Using PHP and MySQL Database" application.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- Example payloads for exploiting the vulnerability are provided.
- The exploit was demonstrated using the `sqlmap` tool.
- The GitHub issue includes screenshots of the results from `sqlmap`.

**Remediation:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
- Implement input validation and filtering.
- Minimize database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits.
