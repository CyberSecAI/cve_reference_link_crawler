  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `node-worker-threads-pool` library's timeout mechanism is not applied to the task execution when using the `StaticPool` constructor directly. When a task is executed without a timeout and gets stuck in an infinite loop or takes an exceptionally long time to complete, it will hijack the worker thread, preventing the pool from processing other tasks. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is the lack of timeout enforcement on tasks executed directly with the `StaticPool.exec()` method. The library allows users to set a `timeout` property when creating a `StaticPool`. However, this timeout isn't used for tasks executed directly with the `.exec()` method. This leads to a situation where a long-running or infinite task can stall the worker thread indefinitely, causing the denial of service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a task that enters an infinite loop or is computationally expensive. This will cause the worker thread to get stuck and not process other tasks, effectively leading to a denial-of-service. If all available worker threads are hijacked by such malicious tasks, the entire service becomes unresponsive. In dynamic pool, attacker might cause a server CPU runout.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to send tasks to the pool that are expensive to compute or cause an infinite loop. This can be done by exploiting specific edge cases in the task logic, which may cause the thread to get stuck. Specifically, the attacker must call `StaticPool.exec` with a malicious task.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit tasks to the `node-worker-threads-pool`.  They don't need privileged access, just the ability to call the `.exec()` method with a malicious task. An attacker also needs to know that `StaticPool.exec()` does not enforce the timeout, which is set at `StaticPool` construction. An attacker can also exhaust worker threads in dynamic pool which leads to CPU resource exhaustion."
