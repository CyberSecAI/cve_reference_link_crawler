Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the C-MOR web interface. Specifically, user-supplied data, such as the camera location, is not properly sanitized before being stored in the web application database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary weakness is the presence of persistent XSS (CWE-79). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access certain pages of the C-MOR web interface.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal user session cookies, manipulate data displayed on the interface, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the affected users.
- **Account Takeover:**  The attacker might also be able to escalate privileges or take over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the C-MOR video surveillance system.
- **Specifically, the `changelocation.pml` endpoint.** An attacker can submit a POST request to the `/changelocation.pml` endpoint with malicious javascript in the `location` parameter.
- Another vulnerable endpoint is `/show-movies.pml` where it's possible to inject javascript code into the logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the C-MOR system to modify camera settings and inject the malicious code.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the C-MOR web interface.
