Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27102:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a symlink race condition in the server filesystem of Pterodactyl Wings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended file system sandbox by exploiting a race condition with symlinks, potentially leading to unauthorized access of the host system's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with control of a server can potentially read files and directories outside of the server's base directory (sandbox root) on the host system. The full extent of the impact is unknown, but it allows for reading files outside of the intended sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by Wings. This implies they are a user of the system with some level of access.
- The attack complexity is low, and no user interaction is required. The attacker only requires low privileges on a server allocated by Wings.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was resolved by a complete rewrite of the server filesystem component within the Wings application.
- The commit d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287 on GitHub is directly related to the resolution of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked under GHSA-494h-9924-xww9.
- The exploit details were embargoed until March 27, 2024, at 18:00 UTC.
