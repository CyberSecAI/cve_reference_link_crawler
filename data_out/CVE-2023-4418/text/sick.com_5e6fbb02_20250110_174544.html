Vulnerability Overview

CVE-2023-4418 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

Description: A remote unprivileged attacker can sent multiple packages to the LMS5xx to disrupt its
availability through a TCP SYN-based denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. By exploiting this vulnerability,
an attacker can flood the targeted LMS5xx with a high volume of TCP SYN requests, overwhelming its
resources and causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable for legitimate users.

CVE-2023-4418 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 7.5
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)

CVE-2023-4419 Use of Hard-coded Credentials

Description: The LMS5xx uses hard-coded credentials, which potentially allow low-skilled unauthorized
remote attackers to reconfigure settings and /or disrupt the functionality of the device.

CVE-2023-4419 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 9.8
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

CVE-2023-4420 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Description: A remote unprivileged attacker can intercept the communication via e.g. Man-In-The-
Middle, due to the absence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the SICK LMS5xx. This lack of encryp-
tion in the communication channel can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The
attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between the LMS5xx and the
Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.

CVE-2023-4420 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 9.8
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE identifier: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)

CVE-2023-31412 Use of Weak Hash

Description: The LMS5xx uses weak hash generation methods, resulting in the creation of insecure
hashs.
If an attacker manages to retrieve the hash, it could lead to collision attacks and the potential
retrieval of the password.

CVE-2023-31412 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
CVSSv3.1 base score: 7.5
CVSSv3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
CWE identifier: CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash)

General Security Practices

General Security Measures

As general security measures, SICK recommends to minimize network exposure of the devices, restrict
network access and follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT
environment.

Vulnerability Classification

SICK performs vulnerability classification by using the CVSS scoring system (CVSS v3.1). The environ-
mental score is dependent on the customer’s environment and can affect the overall CVSS score. SICK
recommends that customers individually evaluate the environmental score to achieve final scoring.
