# [Reflected Cross Site Scripting in Stimulsoft.Dashboards.JS - CVE-2024-24396](https://trustcves.github.io/posts/cve-2024-24396/writeup/)

**Affected Product:** Stimulsoft Dashboards.JS

**Affected Versions:** <2024.1.2

**Fixed Version:** 2024.1.3

**CVE-Number:** CVE-2024-24396

**Severity:** 4.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

*Discovered by Ing. Simon Schönegger, BSc, MSc, DI Lukas Hammer, BSc*

During security research, the researchers discovered that Stimulsoft Dashboards.JS is prone to multiple vulnerabilities including Reflected Cross Site Scripting.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker is only required to visit the Dashboards Application. This vulnerability is rated as unauthtenticated, since this product does not handle authentication on its own.

## Proof of Concept

It is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript-Code into the search bar. This code is executed as soon as the search function is triggered. The following code can be used to trigger this behaviour: `<img src="#" onerror="alert(1)" />`
