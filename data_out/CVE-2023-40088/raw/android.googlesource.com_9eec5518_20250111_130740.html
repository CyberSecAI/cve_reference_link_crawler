            Fix UAF in ~CallbackEnvcom_android_bluetooth_btservice_AdapterService does not null its localJNI environment variable after detaching the thread (which frees theenvironment context), allowing UAF under certain conditions.Null the variable in this case.Testing here was done through a custom unit test; see patchsets 4-6 forcontents.  However, unit testing of the JNI layer is problematic inproduction, so that part of the patch is omitted for final merge.Bug: 291500341Test: atest bluetooth_test_gd_unit, atest net_test_stack_btmTag: #securityIgnore-AOSP-First: Security(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:7a5c71c32d382c0e14083f0d093ae4f5420968ff)Merged-In: I3e5e3c51412640aa19f0981caaa809313d6ad030Change-Id: I3e5e3c51412640aa19f0981caaa809313d6ad030
