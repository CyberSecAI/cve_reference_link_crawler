Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52622:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided patches and commit logs explicitly mention "ext4: avoid online resizing failures due to oversized flex bg". The core issue revolves around allocating memory for a new group data structure during online resizing of an ext4 filesystem, which aligns with the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-52622. Therefore, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the ext4 filesystem's online resizing logic. When resizing an ext4 filesystem with an oversized flex block group size (`flexbg_size`), the kernel attempts to allocate an array (`new_group_data`) that exceeds the maximum allowed allocation size (`MAX_ORDER`). This happens during the `ext4_resize_fs` operation, specifically when adding new flex groups to the file system.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Memory Allocation Size:** The code attempts to allocate a large chunk of memory based on `flexbg_size` without proper checks, potentially exceeding the kernel's allowed limit (determined by `MAX_ORDER` and `PAGE_SIZE`).
*   **Unbounded Allocation:** The initial implementation lacked any mechanism to limit the number of groups added during resizing to avoid exceeding the maximum allocation size. This could lead to an allocation failure.
*   **WARN_ON Trigger:** When the allocation fails due to the oversized memory request, a warning is triggered in `mm/page_alloc.c`. This warning indicates a problem with memory management and can lead to further issues.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial of service. The failed memory allocation during resizing leads to a kernel warning and prevents the resizing operation from completing successfully.
*   **Possible System Instability:** While not explicitly stated, repeated attempts to resize the file system with an oversized flexbg_size could potentially contribute to overall system instability due to memory management issues.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Manipulation:** An attacker needs the ability to manipulate the filesystem resize operation (`resize2fs`) on a vulnerable ext4 filesystem.
*   **Oversized Flex Group:** The attack requires the filesystem to have a configuration that uses an oversized `flexbg_size`. This usually happens when creating the filesystem with an unusual or very large flex block group size with tools like `mkfs.ext4`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Root/Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must have root or administrative privileges to execute `resize2fs` or other filesystem manipulation commands. This is needed to trigger the online resizing operation.
*   **Access to Target System:** The attacker must have access to a system with an ext4 filesystem.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Fix:** The fix introduces `MAX_RESIZE_BG` to limit the amount of memory allocated at one time and divides up the resizing into smaller operations. This ensures that memory allocations for flex group data during resizing do not exceed kernel limits. This also prevents the `WARN_ON` and ensures resizing succeeds.
*   The patch changes the structure `ext4_new_flex_group_data` and the function `alloc_flex_gd`.
*   The patch changes `ext4_setup_next_flex_gd` to take `flex_gd->resize_bg` instead of the `flexbg_size`.
*   The patch also changes the loop where `ext4_setup_next_flex_gd` is called to no longer pass `flexbg_size` but use the `flex_gd` struct which contains `resize_bg` parameter.
