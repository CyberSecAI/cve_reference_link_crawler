### Description

The Product Sort and Display for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the psad\_update\_product\_cat\_custom\_meta\_ajax function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to hide product categories.
