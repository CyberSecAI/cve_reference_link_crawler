## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YaySMTP < 2.2.1 - Subscriber+ SMTP Credentials Leak

### Description

The plugin does not have capability check before displaying the Mailer Credentials in JS code for the settings, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to retrieve them

### Proof of Concept

Install the plugin and configure any mailer other than Default.
Access the wp-admin area with a Subscriber+ user and monitor the traffic using your preferable tool.
Look for var yaySmtpWpData = in the HTTP Response and you'll find all the leaked credentials.
