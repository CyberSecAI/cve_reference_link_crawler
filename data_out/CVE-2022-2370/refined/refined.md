- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The YaySMTP plugin lacks capability checks before displaying mailer credentials in JavaScript code within the settings page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control (CWE-862), specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any authenticated user, including subscribers with the lowest privileges, can retrieve the SMTP credentials by inspecting the HTTP response, exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by accessing the WordPress admin area with a low-privileged user (Subscriber+) and monitoring the network traffic to intercept the leaked credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with at least subscriber-level privileges on the affected WordPress site.
