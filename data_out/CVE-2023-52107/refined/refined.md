Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-52107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of strict permission verification within the WMS (Window Management Service) module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The core issue is that the system does not properly validate permissions before performing certain operations within the WMS module. This means that an attacker, under certain conditions, can bypass intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Confidentiality:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to a breach of service confidentiality, meaning sensitive information or operations might be exposed or accessed by unauthorized entities.

**Attack Vectors:**

* The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided text but the vulnerability resides in the WMS module. Thus, an attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability through an application or process that interacts with WMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to interact with the WMS module in a manner that triggers the inadequate permission verification. The specific method of interaction isn't specified, but it could potentially involve a malicious application or a compromised process.
*   The attacker would not require root access.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple EMUI versions.

**Affected Versions:**

*   EMUI 13.0.0
*   EMUI 12.0.0
*  EMUI 11.0.1
