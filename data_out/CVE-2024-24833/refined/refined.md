- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that should only be available to privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:** An unprivileged user can exploit the lack of access control in a vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with contributor-level privileges.
