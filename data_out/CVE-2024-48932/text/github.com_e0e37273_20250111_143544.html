# Unauthenticated API Discloses Usernames ZimaOS

Moderate

[LinkLeong](/LinkLeong)
published
GHSA-9mrr-px2c-w42c
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/
(ZimaOS)

## Affected versions

≤v1.2.4

## Patched versions

1.2.5

## Description

### Summary

The API endpoint `http://<Server-ip>/v1/users/name` allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information, such as usernames, without any authorization. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to enumerate usernames and leverage them for further attacks, such as brute-force or phishing campaigns.

### Details

ZimaOS API reveals usernames to unauthenticated users, enabling attackers to gather valid usernames for further exploitation. No authentication or authorization token is required to access this data.

### PoC

Send a GET request to the endpoint:

`GET http://<Server-ip>/v1/users/name`

Example response:

```
{
  "username": "johndoe"
}

```
### YouTube Video PoC

### Impact

1. User Enumeration: Attackers can gather usernames, which can then be used for password brute-forcing or targeted phishing attacks.
2. Further Exploitation: This issue can lead to other vulnerabilities being more easily exploited, especially if username-based access controls exist elsewhere in the application.

### Recommendation

1. Access Controls: Implement proper access controls, requiring authentication and authorization to access user-specific endpoints.
2. Role-Based Access: Enforce role-based access checks to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data like usernames.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
