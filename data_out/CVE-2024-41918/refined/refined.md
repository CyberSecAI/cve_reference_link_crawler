Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41918:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Rakuten Ichiba App fails to properly restrict custom URL schemes, allowing it to access arbitrary websites.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper restriction of custom URL schemes ([CWE-939](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/939.html)). This means the app doesn't validate or limit the URLs it can open through custom schemes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website by crafting a malicious URL and tricking the user into opening it using the vulnerable app.
- This could lead to phishing attacks, where the user might enter sensitive information on a fake website disguised as a legitimate one.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL using a custom URL scheme recognized by the vulnerable app.
- This URL is then delivered to the user, who, when clicking it, will trigger the vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the user to click on the malicious URL. This could be done through various means such as sending the URL via email, messaging or other social channels.
- The attacker does not need any prior access to the device or the application itself.

**Affected products:**
- "Rakuten Ichiba App" for Android versions 12.4.0 and earlier
- "Rakuten Ichiba App" for iOS versions 11.7.0 and earlier

**Additional Notes:**
- The JVN entry provides a CVSS v3 score of 3.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N), indicating a low-severity vulnerability due to the high complexity and user interaction required for successful exploitation.
- The vulnerability was reported by Shiga Takuma of BroadBand Security, Inc. to IPA.
- The solution is to update the application to the latest version provided by the developer.
