Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-10556.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `birdsadd.php` file. The application directly uses the value of the "id" parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `birdsadd.php` file.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter.
- Usage of unsanitized user input directly in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering (modification or deletion)
- Potential for comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the HTTP request.
- The vulnerability can be exploited without login or authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `birdsadd.php` file with a crafted `id` parameter.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the "Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- Both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter in a POST request.
- Proof-of-concept payloads for error-based and time-based blind SQL injection are provided.
- The attacker can enumerate database information using tools like sqlmap.
- Suggested remediation includes using prepared statements, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and conducting regular security audits.
