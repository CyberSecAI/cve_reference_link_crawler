The provided content contains information about a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Funboot v1.1, which aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the message title field within the Funboot v1.1 application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: Malicious JavaScript code is stored within the application's database and executed when a user views the message, specifically in the message title field.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data before storing it in the database, allowing the injection of XSS payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cookie Disclosure: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to steal sensitive information, including user session cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker can potentially retrieve the root path of the website and PHP variables, which can aid in further malicious activities.
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: The injected JavaScript can be used to perform other malicious activities such as redirecting users to malicious sites, modifying the content displayed on the page, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the title field of a message through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account with the ability to create messages within the Funboot application
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the message creation functionality.
