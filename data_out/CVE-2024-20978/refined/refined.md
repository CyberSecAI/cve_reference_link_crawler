    "CVE-2024-20978": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Improper input validation or handling within the Server: Optimizer component of MySQL Server.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the way the Optimizer component processes certain data, potentially leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior. The specific nature of this flaw requires an understanding of MySQL internals to analyze. It may involve issues such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, type confusion or other similar memory corruption flaws in how the optimizer interprets or uses the data. "
        ],
        "impact": "The impact is primarily related to the availability of the server, indicating a potential denial-of-service scenario. Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized with high impact for availability which indicates the system can be rendered unusable.",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector is 'Network', which means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network. The protocol involved is the 'MySQL Protocol', meaning attackers will target the MySQL server directly through this protocol.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the MySQL server and the ability to send specially crafted requests that exploit this vulnerability in the optimizer. The 'Privs Req' is 'None' which means the attack can be executed without requiring any prior authentication or privileges on the target server."
