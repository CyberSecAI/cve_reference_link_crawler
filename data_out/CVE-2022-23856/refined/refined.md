{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The local password reset feature in Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud has two vulnerabilities: User enumeration via the `id` parameter and authentication bypass in the password reset process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "User enumeration vulnerability using the `id` parameter which exposes user names.",
        "Authentication bypass vulnerability that allows password change without proper verification."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can enumerate users and bypass authentication to change the password of an existing administrative user. This allows the attacker to perform administrative actions and potentially modify connected authentication systems.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted request to `/ECM/maintenance/forgotpasswordstep1?otpConfig=false&id=5` to enumerate users.",
         "Bypassing password reset verification using a URL or by unhiding a button.",
         "Accessing a login URL with the new credentials."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and does not need to be authenticated."
