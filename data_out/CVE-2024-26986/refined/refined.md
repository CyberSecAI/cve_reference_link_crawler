{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the `kfd_create_process` function when a KFD process creation is attempted while a GPU reset is in progress.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `mmget` reference was not properly released on an error handling code path during KFD process creation. Specifically, when `kfd_is_locked()` returns true (indicating that the KFD is locked due to a GPU reset) the function returns early with `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` but does not release the mmget reference acquired earlier in the function.",
        "This caused a memory leak, as the `mmget` reference was not released."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger a GPU reset and then attempt to create multiple KFD processes. This would cause a memory leak and possibly result in denial of service due to resource exhaustion.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to trigger a GPU reset and create new KFD processes."
