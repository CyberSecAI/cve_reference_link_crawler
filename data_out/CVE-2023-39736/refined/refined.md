Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The mini-app 'Fukunaga_memberscard' exposes the client secret in the response of the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the client secret to the client-side (the mini-app user's device).
*   **Insecure Storage of Secrets:** The application does not adequately protect sensitive credentials, and the client secret is included in the response to a request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Channel Access Token Acquisition:**  An attacker can use the exposed client secret to obtain a channel access token.
*   **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'Fukunaga_memberscard' mini-app. These messages could include phishing links, fraud information, etc.
*   **Compromised Communication Channel:** The channel access token is meant to secure the communication channel within Line, so its compromise could lead to unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** The client secret is exposed in the response of the userEntry request. Thus, a man-in-the-middle attack could obtain the secret.
*   **Direct Access via the Mini-App:**  Simply by opening the mini-app ‘Fukunaga_memberscard’, an attacker can access the response containing the client secret.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Line App Installation:**  The attacker needs to have the Line app installed.
*   **Access to the Mini-App:** The attacker needs to open the ‘Fukunaga_memberscard’ mini-app to trigger the vulnerable request.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network request to obtain the client secret.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is specific to the 'Fukunaga_memberscard' mini-app and version v13.6.1.
* The provided content includes screenshots demonstrating the leak of the client secret and the usage of it to get a channel access token.
*  The provided content shows that the tool by Line can verify that the client secret can indeed be used to generate the channel access token.
