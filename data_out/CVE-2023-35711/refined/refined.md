- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of a user-supplied value before it's dereferenced as a pointer during the parsing of XE files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, leading to an untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious XE file or a malicious page containing such file that the user has to open.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide the malicious file or direct the victim to a malicious page. User interaction (opening the file/page) is required for successful exploitation.
