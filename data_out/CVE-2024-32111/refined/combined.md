# WordPress 6.5.5

---

## WordPress 6.5.5 is now available!

This release features three security fixes. Because this is a security release, **it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.** This minor release also includes [3 bug fixes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?component=!Build%2FTest+Tools&milestone=6.5.5&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=component&order=priority) in Core.

You can [download WordPress 6.5.5 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.5.5.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”. If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

WordPress 6.5.5 is a short-cycle release. The next major release will be version 6.6 which is scheduled for July 16, 2024.

For more information on WordPress 6.5.5, please visit the [HelpHub site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-5-5/).

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for [responsibly reporting vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/wordpress?type=team), and allowing them to be fixed in this release:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the HTML API reported by Dennis Snell of the WordPress Core Team, along with Alex Concha and Grzegorz (Greg) Ziółkowski of the WordPress security team.
* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Template Part block reported independently by Rafie Muhammad of Patchstack and during a third party security audit.
* A path traversal issue affecting sites hosted on Windows reported independently by Rafie M & Edouard L of Patchstack, David Fifield, [x89](https://hackerone.com/x89), [apple502j](https://hackerone.com/apple502j), and [mishre](https://hackerone.com/mishre).

## Thank you to these WordPress contributors

This release was led by [Aaron Jorbin](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/).

WordPress 6.5.5 would not have been possible without the contributions of the following people. Their asynchronous coordination to deliver maintenance and security fixes into a stable release is a testament to the power and capability of the WordPress community.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
