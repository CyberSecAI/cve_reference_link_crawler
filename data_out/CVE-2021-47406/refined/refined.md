Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-47406:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of error checking in the `ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()` function when calling `ext4_map_blocks()`. If `ext4_map_blocks()` fails due to a corrupted file system, `ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()` can enter an infinite loop, causing a system lockup. This issue is specifically triggered when fast commit and inline data are enabled on the ext4 filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite Loop:**  The primary weakness is the potential for an infinite loop within `ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()`.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The lack of proper error handling for the return value of `ext4_map_blocks()` when skipping holes allows the infinite loop to occur.
- **Corrupted File System Handling:** The core issue is the handling of corrupted filesystems when using fast commit with inline data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Lockup/Denial of Service:** The most direct impact is a system lockup due to the infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The system becomes unresponsive requiring a reboot to recover.
- **File System Corruption** : Although the primary symptom is a system lockup, the commit message mentions that fast commit replay is likely corrupting filesystems with inline data. The patch, however, only breaks the infinite loop and does not address the underlying corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File System Corruption:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a corrupted ext4 file system. Specifically, filesystems using inline data and fast commit are more susceptible.
- **Specific Operations:**  The issue can be reproduced with a specific test case (generic/526) indicating that certain operations or file system states might be more prone to triggering this issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Corrupt File Systems:** An attacker would need the ability to create a corrupted ext4 file system or to induce corruption of the file system, specifically when fast commit and inline data are enabled.
- **Access to Mount Filesystem:** The user mounting the corrupted filesystem would trigger the vulnerability. This can be a local user or remote user depending on the use case.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided information suggests the fix for this CVE addresses the symptom of infinite loop and not the root cause of the issue i.e. data corruption caused by fast commit. 
- The fix involves modifying the `skip_hole()` function to return an error code when `ext4_map_blocks()` fails and adding error checking in `ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()` to break the infinite loop.
- The commit messages explicitly mention the problem can be reproduced with generic/526. This highlights that specific conditions can be more likely to trigger the problem.
