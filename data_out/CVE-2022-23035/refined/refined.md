{
  "CVE-2022-23035": {
    "Description": "The management of IRQs associated with physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests involves an iterative operation in particular when cleaning up after the guest's use of the device. In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Incorrect retry scheduling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.",
    "Attack vectors": "x86 HVM guests with one or more passed-through physical devices using multiple physical interrupts.",
    "Required capabilities": "A malicious HVM guest with multiple passed-through physical devices capable of generating interrupts."
