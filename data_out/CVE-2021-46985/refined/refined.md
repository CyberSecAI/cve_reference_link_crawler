Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46985:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) device scanning code within the Linux kernel. Specifically, if the `acpi_device_set_name()` function fails during device addition, the memory allocated for `acpi_device_bus_id->bus_id` is not freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak**: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. When `acpi_device_set_name()` fails, the allocated memory for `acpi_device_bus_id->bus_id` is not released, leading to a gradual consumption of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. If the memory leak is triggered repeatedly, the system may run out of available memory, causing instability and potentially leading to a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an ACPI device is added. Therefore, it would require a malformed or specially crafted ACPI description that leads `acpi_device_set_name()` to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to influence the system's ACPI tables, meaning they would either need to have control of the system or manipulate the ACPI tables through other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided git commit logs show the fix for this memory leak, which involves adding `kfree_const(acpi_device_bus_id->bus_id);` to the error handling path.
- All provided commits address the same vulnerability.
