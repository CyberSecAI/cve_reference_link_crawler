Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-44795** is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Gazelle project.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user input, specifically the `$_COOKIE['username']` variable, within the `disabled.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The code directly uses the value of the `username` cookie within an HTML input field without any filtering or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a classic reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By crafting a malicious cookie, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable `disabled.php` page. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Other malicious activities within the context of the victim's session

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `username` cookie to inject malicious code.
- **Targeted Page Visit:** The victim needs to visit the vulnerable `sections/login/disabled.php` page while having the malicious cookie set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to set the `username` cookie on the victim's browser. This could be done through various means, such as:
  - Attacking another vulnerable part of the site that allows cookie injection
  - Social engineering techniques
  - Man-in-the-middle attack

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable line of code is located in `sections/login/disabled.php`
```php
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="<?=$_COOKIE['username']?>" />
```
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
  1. An attacker sets the `username` cookie with a malicious payload:
  `username=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%3C%22` (URL encoded version of `"><script>alert(1)</script>"`)
  2. The attacker or a victim visits `sections/login/disabled.php`.
  3. The malicious script within the cookie is executed in the victim's browser.
- **Affected File:** `/sections/login/disabled.php`
- **Affected Commit:** `63b3370`
