Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2343

**Affected Software:** Avada WordPress theme (versions <= 7.11.6)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to the insecure implementation of the `form_to_url_action` function in the Avada theme. This function allows authenticated users to specify an arbitrary URL to which form submissions are sent, without proper sanitization or validation, allowing for arbitrary web requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted URL Input:** The form submission URL field does not validate or restrict the input, allowing the attacker to specify any arbitrary internal or external URL.
*   **Lack of Request Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize user input when making outbound HTTP requests, allowing the attacker to manipulate the request parameters, headers, and HTTP verb.
*   **Insecure Function:** The usage of `wp_remote_request` instead of `wp_safe_remote_request` in `wp-content/plugins/fusion-builder/inc/class-fusion-form-submit.php` makes it possible to send requests to arbitrary hosts/urls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Internal Service Access:** Attackers can use the vulnerable functionality to query and modify information from internal services not intended to be exposed to external parties.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from internal services.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By making requests to internal resources or external services under the attacker's control, they may be able to cause denial of service on internal or external targets.
*   **Port Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal network infrastructure to discover open ports, and services.
*  **Custom Requests:** Attackers can send requests using various HTTP verbs like HEAD, PUT and DELETE, not just GET/POST.
*   **Custom Headers:** Attackers can add custom headers to their requests, potentially exploiting further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Through a crafted form:** The attacker crafts a form with a malicious submission URL, custom headers and an HTTP verb other than GET/POST.
*   **WordPress backend:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress backend.
*   **Form submission:** When a user (or attacker) submits the crafted form, the SSRF is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress backend.
*   **Ability to Create Forms:** The attacker needs to be able to create and edit forms using the Avada Form Builder.
* **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests**: To understand how to change the HTTP verb and add headers.

**More details than CVE:**

*   The Github Gist provides specific steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   It shows how to change the HTTP verb from POST/GET to HEAD/PUT/DELETE by modifying the request to `/wp-admin/post.php`.
*   It provides screenshots of the exploit steps in the WordPress backend.
*   The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability is located in the `form_to_url_action` function.
*  The fix involves using `wp_safe_remote_request` which provides sanitization/validation and also admin users should whitelist specific hosts where forms can be sent.
