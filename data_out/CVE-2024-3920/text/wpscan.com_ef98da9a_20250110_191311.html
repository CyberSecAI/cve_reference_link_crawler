## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Flattr <= 1.2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Flattr" settings
2. In the "Flattr Username" enter the PoC: `j"><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Save the changes and view the site to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
