- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SmartSearchWP plugin does not validate access on certain REST routes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Broken access control, specifically the lack of authentication checks on REST API endpoints that handle log purging.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can purge error logs and chat logs from the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending POST requests to the `/wp-json/wdgpt/v1/purge-error-logs` and `/wp-json/wdgpt/v1/purge-chat-logs` endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send requests to the affected endpoints from the network.
