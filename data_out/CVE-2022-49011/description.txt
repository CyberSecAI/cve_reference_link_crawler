hwmon: (coretemp) fix pci device refcount leak in nv1a_ram_new()

As comment of pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() says, it returns
a pci device with refcount increment, when finish using it,
the caller must decrement the reference count by calling
pci_dev_put(). So call it after using to avoid refcount leak.
