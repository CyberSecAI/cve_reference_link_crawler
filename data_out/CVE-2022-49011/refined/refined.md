Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability in the Linux kernel. They all address a PCI device refcount leak in the `coretemp` driver.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to decrement the reference count of a PCI device obtained using `pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()`. The comment for this function clearly states that it returns a PCI device with an incremented reference count. The caller is responsible for decrementing this count using `pci_dev_put()` when finished with the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Resource Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak. Specifically, it's a reference count leak related to a PCI device structure.
*   **Missing `pci_dev_put()` Call:** The code in `drivers/hwmon/coretemp.c` was missing a call to `pci_dev_put()` after using the device, which is essential for correct resource management in the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource exhaustion:**  A refcount leak can lead to resource exhaustion if the code path with the leak is executed repeatedly, which could potentially cause system instability or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Triggering the vulnerable code path:** The vulnerability is triggered within the `adjust_tjmax` function of the `coretemp` driver, specifically when dealing with Intel PCI host bridges. An attacker would need to cause the kernel to execute this code path, likely by interacting with hardware monitoring features.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger the hardware monitoring functionality.**  This likely involves privileged access or control over the hardware configuration, although the specific requirements are not detailed in the provided commit messages.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves adding a `pci_dev_put(host_bridge)` call before returning from the loop in the `adjust_tjmax` function to release the reference count of the PCI device obtained by `pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()`.

The following line was added in the code:

```c
pci_dev_put(host_bridge);
```

and moved to before the return.

The fix is present in all provided commits, which are identical other than their commit hashes and parent commit IDs.
