Good plugins, I hope that in the future it will be improved and the focus will not be on switching to premium status, etc.
Let’s improve it together even more!

Unfortunately I have purchased a WP theme that uses this Themesflat addon and now that I need support with the mobile menu that is not working properly, I can’t get any help.
Check it by yourself, if email them this is what you will get:
Address not foundYour message wasn’t delivered to support@themesflat.com because the address couldn’t be found, or is unable to receive mail.
If you try their gmail, it seems that they don’t even speak English, because they barely reply to you.
You ask for help, they ask for your website login credentials. Would you trust them?
Don’t bother Skype them, they will not reply too.
Wordpress should remove their page, this way people will not get in trouble when in need of support!
