Unfortunately I have purchased a WP theme that uses this Themesflat addon and now that I need support with the mobile menu that is not working properly, I can’t get any help.
Check it by yourself, if email them this is what you will get:
Address not foundYour message wasn’t delivered to support@themesflat.com because the address couldn’t be found, or is unable to receive mail.
If you try their gmail, it seems that they don’t even speak English, because they barely reply to you.
You ask for help, they ask for your website login credentials. Would you trust them?
Don’t bother Skype them, they will not reply too.
Wordpress should remove their page, this way people will not get in trouble when in need of support!

### Description

The Themesflat Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in several widgets via URL parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
