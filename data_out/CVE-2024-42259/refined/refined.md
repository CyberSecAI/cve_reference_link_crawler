{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The size of the mapped area was calculated incorrectly, not considering the partial mapping offset, leading to potential page fault access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect calculation of mapped area size",
    "Missing consideration of partial mapping offset"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Page fault access, which could potentially lead to crashes or other undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when mapping a virtual memory area (VMA) with a partial offset.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger a memory mapping operation with a partial offset."
