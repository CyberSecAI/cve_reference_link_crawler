```
Root cause of vulnerability: A vulnerability in Poppler's `pdfinfo` utility causes the program to crash when processing certain malformed input files. Specifically, this occurs when using the `-dests` parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is a crash caused by processing a malformed PDF when using the -dests parameter in pdfinfo utility, which leads to a denial of service

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause the `pdfinfo` utility to crash, leading to a denial of service.

Attack vectors: An attacker would need to craft or have access to a malformed PDF file. They would then need to execute the pdfinfo utility with the -dests parameter against this file.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to execute the `pdfinfo` utility with a crafted malformed PDF file.
