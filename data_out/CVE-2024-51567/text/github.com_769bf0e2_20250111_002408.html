Hi [@usmannasir](https://github.com/usmannasir)! Given the reference in [CVE-2024-51567](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51567), I'm assuming this commit, does, in fact, fix the permissions issue described there. The reason I bring it up is because there's no associated pull request or test or anything that explicitly calls out [CVE-2024-51567](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w6g2-qqv5-83qj "CVE-2024-51567"), and given the reports of exploitation of this bug in the wild, I want to make sure that this isn't a partial fix and there's some other commit floating around that fully rectifies it.

Are you planning on a release note for this in a tagged branch? I see this commit exists here:

```
git branch -a --contains 5b08cd6
* stable
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/stable
  remotes/origin/stable
  remotes/origin/v2.3.7
  remotes/origin/v2.3.8
  remotes/origin/v2.3.8-dev

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
