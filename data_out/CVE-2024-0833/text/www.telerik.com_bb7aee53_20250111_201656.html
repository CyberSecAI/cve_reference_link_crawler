## Frequently Asked Questions

* What is Telerik Test Studio?
  Telerik Test Studio is а test automation platform for web, desktop and responsive web applications. It offers functional UI, load/performance and RESTful API testing and is designed to support both the less experienced QAs as well as the savvier automation engineers with coding skills and software engineers in test. Test Studio falls into the category of visual recording tools that allow users to create tests based on recording actions in the browser. Recorded tests can be further expanded through going into the test script and performing advanced in-code actions. Test Studio leverages the first of its kind hybrid technology to locate elements based on a combination of object ID and image, which places Test Studio among the tools with the most stable element-find logic. Apart from being able to automate anything found on the web, Test Studio covers a wide range of legacy and modern technologies, including the latest WPF framework updates and innovative tech such as Blazor.
* Does Test Studio integrate with Visual Studio?
  Yes, Test Studio comes with out-of-the box plugin allowing you to automate end-to-end across web and desktop, right inside Visual Studio. The plugin is available with a Test Studio Ultimate license and as part of the DevCraft Ultimate bundle. It enables test automation of .NET applications within your favorite IDE, with native support for the most popular Telerik and Kendo UI components by way of built-in translators.
* Is Test Studio easy to work with?
  Test Studio is an easy-to-use tool for anyone who's new to automated testing because it doesn’t require writing code and has a very intuitive record & playback interface to support non-technical users. Test Studio is also easy to learn for highly skilled testers as, with its advanced features, it allows them to make very effective use of the tool and solve even hard-to-automate scenarios. What users love most about Test Studio is that it is so easy to create and run tests, ensuring that critical application features are working correctly and giving businesses the confidence that everything remains stable during development.
* How to install Telerik Test Studio?

  It is fairly easy to install Test Studio. You only need to download a free trial from the Test Studio website. Once you have downloaded the Test Studio \*.exe or \*.msi file, double click it to start the installation wizard. The only important prerequisite to consider before you install Test Studio is having administrator rights on your machine. The installation and setup are described step by step in the [technical documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/prerequisites/installation/install-procedure).

  When you successfully purchase a Test Studio license, you can activate it within the already installed Test Studio instance.
* Is Test Studio based on Selenium?
  Test Studio is not based on Selenium. Test Studio’s underlying .NET-based Testing Framework is proprietary technology that receives consistent commercial support, meaning that by shipping new Test Studio features with each release, the Testing Framework gets regular updates to support new functionality. The Testing Framework is free to download and use but it requires advanced coding skills to create end-to-end UI tests. The Test Studio standalone tool on the other hand is an out-of-the box solution for automated testing, relying on dedicated professional support by the engineers who build the tool. Users, especially the less experienced ones, get access to ready-to-use features, built-in multi-browser support, reusability of elements across tests, test suites, projects and more.
* Which testing methodologies does Test Studio support?
  Test Studio allows you to automate UI testing for WPF and web applications based on any available web/front-end technology. In addition, Test Studio supports load testing as well as RESTful APIs to verify the integrity of API requests and help cover complex end-to-end, performance and integration testing scenarios. Test Studio also enables integration of test suites into any CI/CD setup, supporting all common CI platforms: Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity and anything in between.

* Can I schedule tests with Test Studio?
  Yes, you can. Test Studio allows you to schedule tests for execution on virtual machines or remote servers. To do that, you need to install the Test Studio Run-Time add-on on several servers or virtual machines and distribute your tests for faster, parallel execution. With Run-Time installed on build servers, agents and test controllers, you’ll be able to leverage the included test runner to execute tests as part of your build process and continuous integration environment.
* Can I use Test Studio on a virtual machine?
  Yes, you can. Test Studio allows you to run headed-UI or three times faster headless tests on any physical or virtual Windows machine. By configuring virtual machines to act as remote execution servers, you can simultaneously execute test lists remotely, schedule runs, store test results and much more.
* How to locate elements with Test Studio?
  Most modern test automation tools and frameworks utilize either attributes or images to locate elements. Test Studio combines both approaches into its unique hybrid logic to find objects. While creating a recorded test, Test Studio records not only an element’s unique combination of locators, but also an image for each element. During execution, Test Studio first looks for the object’s DOM-based find logic to locate an element. If it doesn’t succeed in locating the element, it looks for the recorded element’s image. The result is that test failures caused by changed or dynamic elements are reduced to a minimum.
* Can I test WPF applications with Test Studio?
  Yes, you can. Test Studio allows you to automate a wide range of WPF applications based on both legacy and modern framework technologies, providing day-zero support for .NET 4.5+, .NET Core, .NET 5, .NET 6 Preview or higher versions.
* Which type of license do I need to run tests in CI/CD?

  Integration with all popular CI/CD tools and platforms is supported under both Test Studio Web & Desktop and Test Studio Ultimate licenses. Each Test Studio Ultimate floating-machine license includes one free Test Studio Run-Time add-on, which ensures additional flexibility by allowing remote test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Additional Run-Time licenses can be purchased any time and will work with both Test Studio Web & Desktop and Test Studio Ultimate. [Read more](/teststudio/test-automation-solutions-for-the-entire-team) about our licensing options.
* Can I move a Test Studio license from one machine to another?

  Yes, you can. Both Test Studio Web & Desktop and Test Studio Ultimate licenses are floating-machine based, which means that each Test Studio license can be installed on many machines but can run only on one machine at a time. Find answers to all your questions about licensing in our [Licensing FAQs](/purchase/faq/teststudio).
