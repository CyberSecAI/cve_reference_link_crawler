# First Immutable Variable Initialization

Moderate

[hedgar2017](/hedgar2017)
published
GHSA-h8jv-969m-94r4
Oct 25, 2023

## Package

zkvyper
(Vyper)

## Affected versions

<1.3.10

## Patched versions

1.3.10

## Description

### Impact

The bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting the criteria described below.

The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized.

In the example below, there is a string with 64 bytes allocated, but only 4 (32) are written.

It results in the 2nd word’s index unset, that is effectively set to 0, so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the [ImmutableSimulator](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-system-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ImmutableSimulator.sol#L37).

As the fix, our compiler will have to set all indexes in advance. The problem will go away, but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space, e.g. `String[4096]`.

Vyper source code example:

```
# @version 0.3.9

IMMUTABLE_1: public(immutable(bytes32))
IMMUTABLE_2: public(immutable(String[64]))

@external
def __init__():
    IMMUTABLE_1 = keccak256(_abi_encode(msg.sender))
    IMMUTABLE_2 = "Test"
```

Constructor return data:

```
0x32
0x04
0x00 IMMUTABLE_1
0x20 0x40
0x40 "Test"
0x00 0x00.       // The index must have been 0x60 here

```

Analysis has shown that no contracts were affected by the date of publishing this advisory.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.3.10.

### Workarounds

Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-46232

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
