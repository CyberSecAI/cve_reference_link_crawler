- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization when handling the `name` variable in the Audio File creation functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed when a user visits the Audio File menu, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a malformed `<img>` tag containing the malicious JavaScript code through the `name` parameter during the Audio File creation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ZKTeco ZKBio CVSecurity 6.1.1 application and have access to the "System / System Management / Audio File" section.
