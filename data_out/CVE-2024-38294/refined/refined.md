*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   CSRF: The attacker would need to lure a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
    *   RCE: The attacker would need to send malicious requests to the vulnerable scripts (`email_registration_back.php` and `still_connected.php`).

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   CSRF: Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application and the ability to trick a logged-in user.
    *   RCE: Requires knowledge of the vulnerable scripts, the ability to craft malicious requests, and network accessibility to the target server.
