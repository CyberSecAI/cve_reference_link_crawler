Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insufficient user input validation for the `user` parameter in the `register.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `register.php`.
- Lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user input within SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering or deletion.
- Comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a crafted POST request to `register.php` with malicious SQL code in the `user` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The vulnerability is present in the 'user' parameter.
- A proof of concept (POC) is provided, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted POST request, including a time-based payload.
- The provided information also shows the usage of sqlmap tool to extract database information.
- The vulnerability is present in `Itsourcecode "Online Blood Bank Management System" in PHP 1.0`

**Suggested Remediation:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
- Implement strict input validation and filtering.
- Minimize database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits.
