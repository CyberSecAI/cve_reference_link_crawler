2. Vulnerability

2.1. Affected Products

The vulnerability described in this document was reported for the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws 20.00 (20191009)

The vulnerability only affects the client side of the API when using TLS. The server side is not affected.

2.2. Severity and Impact

CVSS v3.1 score: 7.4 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

This issue can possibly cause a Man In The Middle attack on an Ada Web Server client if an attacker uses a crafted
certificate with a modified hostname.

A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) has been created for that case, and will be referred as
CVE-2024-37015.

2.3. Detailed Description

Thanks to a great investigation work by Chris Culnane, a vulnerability on the client side of the Ada Web Server
has been discovered.

There are indeed three issues for TLS enabled Ada Web Server clients. One of them does not have a workaround:

1. By default, expired certificate are not checked

2. By default, self-signed certificate are not checked

3. Certificate hostname cannot be verified

The example below allows to check points 1 and 2.

with Ada.Exceptions;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Strings.Fixed;

with AWS.Response;
with AWS.Client;
with AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate;

procedure Sslconfig_Example is

use Ada;
use Ada.Exceptions;
use AWS.Client;

Data
Conn
SSL_Cfg : AWS.Net.SSL.Config;

: AWS.Response.Data;
: AWS.Client.HTTP_Connection;

begin

AWS.Net.SSL.Initialize
(Config => SSL_Cfg,

Certificate_Filename => "",
Security_Mode
Exchange_Certificate => True,
Trusted_Ca_Filename => "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt");

=> AWS.Net.SSL.TLS_Client,

=> "https://wrong.host.badssl.com/",

(continued from previous page)

if AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate.Verified (AWS.Client.Get_Certificate (Conn)) /= True␣

(cid:44)→then

raise Constraint_Error with AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate.Status_Message (AWS.

(cid:44)→Client.Get_Certificate (Conn));

end if;

AWS.Client.Get (Conn, Data);
Text_IO.Put_Line (AWS.Response.Message_Body (Data));

exception

when Occurrence : others =>

Text_IO.Put_Line (Exception_Message (Occurrence));

end Sslconfig_Example;

Although the certificate of https://wrong.host.badssl.com/ has an invalid host name, the above example
does not throw an exception as it should.

3. Solution

3.1. Workarounds

Checking for certificate validity is achieved through AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate.Verified (AWS.Client.
Get_Certificate (Conn)) /= True, but the host name check is not part of the verification.

As an incomplete workaround for hostname validation issue, it is possible to filter the accepted certificates on some
appropriate values (on the issuer for instance).

3.2. Correction

The vulnerability described in this document is corrected in the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws > 24.2

Starting from build date 20240627, the Ada Web Server component is fixed on wavefront.

4. Appendix

4.1. CVSS Score Justification

Justification

Met-
ric
AV:N Attack Vector through Network.
AC:H A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker’s control. That is, a successful attack
cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort
in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

PR:N No privilege required to perform an attack.
UI:N No user interaction required to perform an attack.
S:U The exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same authority.
C:H There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being
divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the
disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.

I:H There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to
modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified,
but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

A:N There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.
E:U No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical.
RL:U There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.
RC:C Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).
Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor
of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability.
