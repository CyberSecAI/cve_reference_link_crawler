                            A W S - Ada Web Server
                                24.0 release

Authors:
   Dmitriy Anisimkov
   Pascal Obry

AWS stand for Ada Web Server. It is a small yet powerful HTTP component to
embed in any applications. It means that you can communicate with your
application using a standard Web browser and this without the need for a Web
Server. AWS is fully developed in Ada with GNAT.

AWS support SOAP/WSDL, Server Push, HTTPS/SSL, client HTTP, hotplug
modules...

AWS comes with SOAP/WSDL support, two tools are proposed:

   ada2wsdl   which generates a WSDL document from an Ada spec

   wsdl2aws   which generates stubs/skeletons AWS code from a WSDL document

Both tools have mapping for standard Ada types but also supports Ada
enumerations, character, records and arrays.

The SOAP implementation has been validated on <http://validator.soapware.org/>.
This on-line service is not available anymore but the current implementation
is validated against the Apache/AXIS SOAP implementation to ensure the
interoperability. Some users have also reported to have used AWS/SOAP with
.NET and gSOAP without trouble.

Non upward compatible changes
-----------------------------

Note that the changes listed below can introduce non upward compatibility.
In such a case we try to give proper advice on how to change the code
to work properly. Of course we try to avoid this as much as possible
but we really prefer to have a clean API instead of keeping awkward
implementations.

- The SSL initialization API has been reworked to have support for
  certificate and host verification.

  By default AWS is now checking for certificate and host validity.
  The parameter Certificate_Required has been renamed
  Check_Certificate for clarity on the AWS.Net.SSL.Intialize call.

  Setting Check_Certificate to False makes AWS behave as in previous
  version (but this is not recommanded) for security reasons.

- To support SMTP secure STARTTLS switching protocol the parameter to
  SMTP.Initialize has been changed from Secure to Security and
  instead of a boolean it takes a Secure_Connection enumeration which
  can be No, TLS or STARTTLS.

  If Secure was set to False, Security must be No.

  If Secure was set to True, Security should probably be TLS except if
  the STARTTLS swicthing protocol is to be used.

Obsolescent features
--------------------

In each new version we try to be upward compatible with previous
version. This is really important, but in some cases it seems that a
"redesign" of the API would be good in the long term. All obsolescent
features will be listed in this section. Those features will be
removed in the next version. Note that you can check usage of those
features in your application by using the GNAT's -gnatwj option as we
have tagged all obsolescent features with a pragma.

LibreSSL (optional):

   You need to install manually the development libraries (>= 2.8.0).
   LibreSSL is an implementation fully compatible with OpenSSL, you
   just have to configure AWS as with OpenSSL.

GNUTLS (optional):

   You need to install manually the development libraries. AWS needs at
   least version 3.6.x of GNUTLS.

OpenLDAP library (optional) :

2. Vulnerability

2.1. Affected Products

The vulnerability described in this document was reported for the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws 20.00 (20191009)

The vulnerability only affects the client side of the API when using TLS. The server side is not affected.

2.2. Severity and Impact

CVSS v3.1 score: 7.4 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

This issue can possibly cause a Man In The Middle attack on an Ada Web Server client if an attacker uses a crafted
certificate with a modified hostname.

A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) has been created for that case, and will be referred as
CVE-2024-37015.

2.3. Detailed Description

Thanks to a great investigation work by Chris Culnane, a vulnerability on the client side of the Ada Web Server
has been discovered.

There are indeed three issues for TLS enabled Ada Web Server clients. One of them does not have a workaround:

1. By default, expired certificate are not checked

2. By default, self-signed certificate are not checked

3. Certificate hostname cannot be verified

The example below allows to check points 1 and 2.

with Ada.Exceptions;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Strings.Fixed;

with AWS.Response;
with AWS.Client;
with AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate;

procedure Sslconfig_Example is

use Ada.Exceptions;
use AWS.Client;

Conn
SSL_Cfg : AWS.Net.SSL.Config;

: AWS.Response.Data;
: AWS.Client.HTTP_Connection;

begin

AWS.Net.SSL.Initialize
(Config => SSL_Cfg,

Certificate_Filename => "",
Security_Mode
Exchange_Certificate => True,
Trusted_Ca_Filename => "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt");

=> AWS.Net.SSL.TLS_Client,

Text_IO.Put_Line (Exception_Message (Occurrence));

end Sslconfig_Example;

Although the certificate of https://wrong.host.badssl.com/ has an invalid host name, the above example
does not throw an exception as it should.

3. Solution

3.1. Workarounds

Checking for certificate validity is achieved through AWS.Net.SSL.Certificate.Verified (AWS.Client.
Get_Certificate (Conn)) /= True, but the host name check is not part of the verification.

As an incomplete workaround for hostname validation issue, it is possible to filter the accepted certificates on some
appropriate values (on the issuer for instance).

3.2. Correction

The vulnerability described in this document is corrected in the following product versions:

• Ada Web Server - aws > 24.2

Starting from build date 20240627, the Ada Web Server component is fixed on wavefront.

4. Appendix

4.1. CVSS Score Justification

Justification

Met-
ric
AV:N Attack Vector through Network.
AC:H A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker’s control. That is, a successful attack
cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort
in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

PR:N No privilege required to perform an attack.
UI:N No user interaction required to perform an attack.
S:U The exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same authority.
C:H There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being
divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the
disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.

I:H There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to
modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified,
but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

A:N There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.
E:U No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical.
