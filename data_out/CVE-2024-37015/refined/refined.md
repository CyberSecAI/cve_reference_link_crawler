```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ada Web Server client does not verify the hostname in the certificate presented by the server during a TLS handshake.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing certificate hostname validation",
    "Expired certificate are not checked by default",
    "Self-signed certificate are not checked by default"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is possible. An attacker can intercept and modify communications between the client and server by presenting a crafted certificate with a modified hostname. This can lead to a loss of confidentiality and integrity of data being transmitted.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Ada Web Server client and the server it is trying to connect to, and needs to be able to present a malicious certificate with a hostname different than expected by the client."
