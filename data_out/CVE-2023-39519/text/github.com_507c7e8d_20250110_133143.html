# There is a risk of sensitive information leakage in the user information acquisition of CloudExplorer Lite

## Package

maven

com.fit2cloud
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

versions: < = 1.3.1

## Patched versions

1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

There is a risk of sensitive information leakage in the user information acquisition of CloudExplorer Lite.

The reproduction steps are as follows:

1.Using the system administrator account to log in, the following interface returns information about all users in the current system, including the password md5: <https://cloudexplorer-lite-demo.fit2cloud.com/management-center/api/user/page?currentPage=1&pageSize=1>

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52996290/258696031-f4518838-a03d-4b2d-b69c-f89dc1d620c4.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52996290/258696031-f4518838-a03d-4b2d-b69c-f89dc1d620c4.png)

2.Using the MD5 library to search, you can find the plaintext passwords of some users.

Expected processing logic:

stay <https://github.com/CloudExplorer-Dev/CloudExplorer-Lite/blob/main/framework/management-center/backend/src/main/java/com/fit2cloud/controller/UserController.java> Although the listUser interface has been set as read-only permission, there should be restrictions on returning data and sensitive credential information such as passwords cannot be returned, resulting in the risk of losing control of permissions.
