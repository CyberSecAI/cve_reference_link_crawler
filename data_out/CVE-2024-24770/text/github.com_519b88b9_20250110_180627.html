# Username enumeration attack on recover password/recover MFA token

Low

[bartvanb](/bartvanb)
published
GHSA-5h3x-6gwf-73jm
Mar 14, 2024

## Package

pip

vantage6
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=4.2.2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Much like [GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53 "GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53"), it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost` and `/2fa/lost`, which send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA token. Usernames can be found by assessing response time differences, and additionally, they can be found because the endpoint gives a response "Failed to login" if the username exists.

### Patches

No

### Workarounds

No

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-24770

### Weaknesses

[CWE-208](/advisories?query=cwe%3A208)
