[Product]
IBM i Access Client Solutions

[Versions]
All

[Remediation/Fixes]
None

[Vulnerability Type]
Remote Credential Theft

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-22318

[Security Issue]
IBM i Access Client Solutions (ACS) is vulnerable to remote credential
theft when NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is enabled on Windows workstations.
Attackers can create UNC capable paths within ACS 5250 display terminal
configuration ".HOD" or ".WS" files to point to a hostile server. If NTLM
is enabled and the user opens an attacker supplied file the Windows
operating system will try to authenticate using the current user's session.
The attacker controlled server could then capture the NTLM hash information
to obtain the user's credentials.
