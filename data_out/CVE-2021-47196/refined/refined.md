The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47196.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition in the RDMA subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, during the creation of a Queue Pair (QP), the send and receive Completion Queue (CQ) pointers were not being set before the operation was forwarded to the driver. In the case of mlx5 driver, if the QP creation fails, the QP destroy path is triggered, which relies on proper CQ pointers. The lack of initialization could lead to the use of uninitialized pointers and subsequent use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Improper initialization of send and receive CQ pointers during QP creation, specifically for mlx5 driver.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to use-after-free.
- Potential denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local user with the ability to create RDMA QPs via the `ib_uverbs` interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to interact with the RDMA subsystem via `ib_uverbs` interface to trigger QP creation, causing it to fail.
