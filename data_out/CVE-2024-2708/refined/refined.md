- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formexeCommand` function of Tenda AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `formexeCommand` function receives the `cmdinput` parameter from a POST request. This input is copied using `strcpy` into a fixed-size buffer (`cmd_buf`) of 512 bytes without proper bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow by providing a `cmdinput` string larger than 512 bytes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/goform/execCommand` endpoint with a long `cmdinput` parameter passed via a cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device and needs to be able to inject a large string into the `cmdinput` parameter.
