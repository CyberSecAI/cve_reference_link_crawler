- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Enhanced Plugin Admin plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that is then unknowingly executed by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a higher privileged, authenticated user to interact with a crafted malicious request (e.g., by tricking them into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
