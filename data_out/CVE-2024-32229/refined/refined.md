The provided content relates to CVE-2024-32229.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `copy_column` function within `libavfilter/vf_tiltandshift.c` when processing a crafted input file with the tiltandshift filter in FFmpeg version 7.0. Specifically, the issue occurs at line 189 within the `copy_column` function. The overflow happens during a memcpy operation when copying image plane data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application due to memory corruption. In this case, ASAN detected the heap-buffer-overflow and the application aborted.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted video file (poc22ffmpeg) is processed by FFmpeg using the `tiltandshift` filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the FFmpeg command with the crafted file as input.
