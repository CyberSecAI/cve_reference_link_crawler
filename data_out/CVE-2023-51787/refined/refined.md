- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A memory leak occurs in Wind River VxWorks 7 (versions 22.09 and 23.03) when a VxWorks task or POSIX thread using OpenSSL exits. The per-task memory allocated for OpenSSL is not freed upon task termination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Repeated creation and termination of tasks/threads that use OpenSSL can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing instability or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires the creation and termination of tasks or POSIX threads that use OpenSSL. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create and terminate tasks or threads within the vulnerable VxWorks environment.
