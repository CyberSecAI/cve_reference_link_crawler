Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of NEU files by Siemens Simcenter Femap. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within these files. This lack of validation leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  The application copies user-supplied data from a NEU file into a stack-based buffer without checking if the size of the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.
*   **Improper Input Validation**: The core issue stems from the application's failure to properly validate the size of user-provided data in NEU files before processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the Simcenter Femap process. This allows them to potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious NEU File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted NEU file containing malicious data designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target user must either open the malicious NEU file using Siemens Simcenter Femap or visit a malicious webpage that attempts to trigger the vulnerability (although the content focuses on opening a malicious file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious NEU file to the victim. This could be done by sending it as an attachment, hosting it on a website, etc.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), further detailing the memory corruption issue.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of NEU files, indicating a flaw in the file processing logic.
*   The provided content also references multiple related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-46151 to CVE-2021-46161) in Simcenter Femap that have similar attack vectors (NEU file parsing) and impact.
*   The vulnerability is also associated with ZDI-CAN-14683, ZDI-CAN-15283, ZDI-CAN-15303 and ZDI-CAN-15593.
*   Siemens recommends users not to open untrusted NEU files and update to version 2022.1 or later.
