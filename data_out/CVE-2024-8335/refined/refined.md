Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8335 (though the CVE description itself is a placeholder)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/resource/runlogon.php` file of OpenRapid RapidCMS. Specifically, the `username` parameter, submitted via a POST request, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The lack of sanitization of the `username` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
*   **Unauthorised Access:** The vulnerability is present within the registry service, which means it can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential data managed by RapidCMS.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues or service disruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful exploitation may allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges or execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/resource/runlogon.php` endpoint.
*   **`username` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `username` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the RapidCMS server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability because it is present in the registration service.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of crafting HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `/resource/runlogon.php`.
*   The `username` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting SQL code into the `username` field such as `' or if(length(database())>4,sleep(3),1)#`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection technique.
* The vulnerability is present in RapidCMS version Dev.1.3.1
