- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary from case to case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by crafting malicious requests and tricking an authenticated user into executing them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an unwanted action. The attacker does not need any authentication on the vulnerable plugin.
