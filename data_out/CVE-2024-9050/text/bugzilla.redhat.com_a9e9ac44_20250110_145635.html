In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-20 18:30:55 UTC  ``` A security issue in NM-libreswan, where we fail to sanitize the VPN configuration from a local unprivileged user and pass it directly to Libreswan.  The libreswan connection configuration is simple key=value format, but we fail to check for or escape special characters, including newlines, which makes it possible for the user to trick us to treat values as key.  Unfortunately, there's one particular key that takes an executable command as an argument: leftupdown (couldn't find more in ipsec.conf(5)). We normally use it to specify the NM-libreswan callback, that would pass L3 configuration back to NM. It can be abused to execute arbitrary code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-22 12:22:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:8312 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8312](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8312)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-22 18:15:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:8338 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8338](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8338)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 09:59:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:8356 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8356](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8356)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:00:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:8358 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8358](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8358)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:02:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2024:8357 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8357](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8357)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:07:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:8353 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8353](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8353)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:09:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:8354 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8354](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8354)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:12:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:8355 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8355](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8355)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-23 10:17:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:8352 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8352](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8352)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-13 15:18:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9555 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9555](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9555)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2313828#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-13 15:45:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9556 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9556](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9556)   ``` |  |
