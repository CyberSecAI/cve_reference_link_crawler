| **Description** There is an encoding mismatch regarding critical options with values between `ssh-keygen` and `cryptography`:   1. Loading an SSH certificate generated by `ssh-keygen` with `cryptography` does not yield expected values. 2. Reading an SSH certificates generated by `SSHCertificateBuilder` with `ssh-keygen` fails.   **Steps** Re 1:   1. Generate a key to be signed: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` 2. Generate a CA signing key: `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa` 3. Sign a certificate: `ssh-keygen -s id_ed25519 -n cryptouser,testuser -I test@cryptography.io -O "critical:force-command=echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" -O "critical:verify-required" -V 0x63b2b264:0x767eb5c0 id_ecdsa.pub` 4. Load the certificate with `cryptography`:  ``` from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import (     load_ssh_public_identity, )  cert = load_ssh_public_identity(     b"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com AAAAKGVjZHNhLXNoYTItbm"     b"lzdHAyNTYtY2VydC12MDFAb3BlbnNzaC5jb20AAAAgLfsFv9Gbc6LZSiJFWdYQl"     b"IMNI50GExXW0fBpgGVf+Y4AAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBIzVyRgVLR4F38bIOLBN"     b"8CNm8Nf+eBHCVkKDKb9WDyLLD61CEmzjK/ORwFuSE4N60eIGbFidBf0D0xh7G6o"     b"TNxsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAUdGVzdEBjcnlwdG9ncmFwaHkuaW8AAAAaAAAACm"     b"NyeXB0b3VzZXIAAAAIdGVzdHVzZXIAAAAAY7KyZAAAAAB2frXAAAAAWAAAAA1mb"     b"3JjZS1jb21tYW5kAAAALAAAAChlY2hvIGFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh"     b"YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhAAAAD3ZlcmlmeS1yZXF1aXJlZAAAAAAAAACCAAAAFXBlcm1"     b"pdC1YMTEtZm9yd2FyZGluZwAAAAAAAAAXcGVybWl0LWFnZW50LWZvcndhcmRpbm"     b"cAAAAAAAAAFnBlcm1pdC1wb3J0LWZvcndhcmRpbmcAAAAAAAAACnBlcm1pdC1wd"     b"HkAAAAAAAAADnBlcm1pdC11c2VyLXJjAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzAAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1"     b"NTE5AAAAICH6csEOmGbOfT2B/S/FJg3uyPsaPSZUZk2SVYlfs0KLAAAAUwAAAAt"     b"zc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAAEDz2u7X5/TFbN7Ms7DP4yArhz1oWWYKkdAk7FGFkHfjtY"     b"/YfNQ8Oky3dCZRi7PnSzScEEjos7723dhF8/y99WwH" )  print(cert.critical_options[b"force-command"]) assert cert.critical_options == {     b"force-command": b"echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",     b"verify-required": b"", } ```  ``` b'\x00\x00\x00(echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/home/user/test.py", line 21, in <module>     assert cert.critical_options == {b"force-command": b"echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", b"verify-required": b""} AssertionError ```  Re 2:   1.

The format of this field is a sequence of zero or more tuples:  ``` string       name string       data  ```  So that's the first header for the data. You then have to look at the table to determine the format of data's contents. E.g.  force-command string Specifies a command that is executed ...  So, for name=force-command, the contents of the data buffer are a string. That's the second header.  The intent is to support options/extensions with data types other than string, e.g. integers or arrays of string.  [Source](https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2015-April/033849.html)  `golang/crypto` had the same issue: [golang/go#10569](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10569) |

| A few more steps before we close this:   * Backport to 41.0.x with warning for parsing the incorrect encoding ([Backport ssh cert fix #9211](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/9211)) * Changelog entry to 42 stating we've dropped support (concurrent with forward porting the 41.0.2 changelog) |
