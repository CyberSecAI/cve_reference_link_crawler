This content is related to CVE-2022-20887.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of the affected routers. This can lead to buffer overflows (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with *root*-level privileges.
* Cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker sends a crafted request to the web-based management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be authenticated with valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.
* The device needs to have the web-based management interface accessible either through the LAN (always available) or through the WAN connection with remote management enabled. By default, remote management is disabled.
