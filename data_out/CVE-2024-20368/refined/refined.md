- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform arbitrary actions on the affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to persuade a user of the web interface to follow a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link and social engineer a user to click it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
