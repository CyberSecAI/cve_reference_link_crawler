{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SKP files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted malicious SKP file or by visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of such a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the victim open a malicious SKP file or visit a malicious web page."
