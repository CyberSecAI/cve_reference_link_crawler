```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates with special keywords for parsing commands. The size of command parameters isn't checked against the stack buffer size before using `sprintf`, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in command parsing within the `DetranCLI` binary."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet containing a vulnerable `DetranCLI` command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device, likely requiring network access and knowledge of the device's command structure. A high privilege user on the device is required to execute the vulnerable commands."
