- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Dell BIOS contains an improper input validation vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution in System Management RAM (SMRAM). This could lead to system compromise, as indicated by the high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact scores.
- **Attack vectors:** A local authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability by using a System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and must be authenticated with administrative privileges to trigger the SMI and exploit the improper input validation.
