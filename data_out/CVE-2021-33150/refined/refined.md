- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the hardware design, specifically some Intel Trace Hub instances, which allow activation of test or debug logic at runtime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the ability to activate test or debug logic at runtime on vulnerable Intel Trace Hub instances, which should not be exposed to end-users, as it allows unauthorized access to internal functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the system, as an unauthenticated user must physically interact with the system to exploit this flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires physical access to the system and does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
