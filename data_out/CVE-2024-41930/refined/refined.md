- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MF Teacher Performance Management System contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user who accesses the affected website. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring user interaction (UI:R). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the system, which are then executed when a user interacts with the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N), but must be able to get a user to interact with the malicious script, such as by clicking a link.
