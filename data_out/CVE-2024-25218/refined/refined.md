{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Task Manager App fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the victim's browser within the context of the affected site. This could allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious script code into the 'Project Name' field within the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the application's interface and insert the malicious payload into the vulnerable input field. This requires the attacker to have a registered account on the Task Manager app."
