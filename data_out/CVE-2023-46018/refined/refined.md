Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the `remail` parameter in the `receiverReg.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of sanitization of the `remail` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Extraction of sensitive information from the database.
    *   Bypassing authentication mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `remail` parameter in the `receiverReg.php` file via a crafted POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `receiverReg.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
*   The attack can be performed locally.

**Technical Details**
* The provided proof of concept uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate the SQL injection vulnerability. It first saves a sample POST request to `request.txt`. It then utilizes `sqlmap` with the following parameters:
    * `-r request.txt`:  specifies the request file.
    * `-p remail`: specifies the vulnerable parameter to target.
    * `--risk 3 --level 3`: sets the risk and level of tests performed by `sqlmap`.
    * `--dbms mysql`: specifies the database type.
    * `--batch`: run in batch mode.
    * `--current-db`: extracts the name of the current database.
*   The successful exploitation through sqlmap reveals that the current database is named `bloodbank`.
