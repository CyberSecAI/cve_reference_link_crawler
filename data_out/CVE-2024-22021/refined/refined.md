Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-22021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within Veeam Recovery Orchestrator, allowing a user with the "Plan Author" role to bypass intended scope restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** A low-privileged user (Plan Author) can retrieve plans from scopes they are not assigned to. This indicates a flaw in the application's access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information about recovery plans, such as configuration details, data locations, or infrastructure settings. This information could be used for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Application Interface:** The attack vector is through the Veeam Recovery Orchestrator's user interface or API, where the low-privileged user interacts with the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Compromised User Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account within Veeam Recovery Orchestrator with the "Plan Author" role.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Veeam Recovery Orchestrator server.
