The NXP Data Co-Processor (DCP) is a built-in hardware module for specific NXP SoCsÂ¹ that implements a dedicated AES cryptographic engine for encryption/decryption operations. The dcp_tool reference implementation included in the repository selected the test key, regardless of its `-t` argument. This issue has been patched in commit 26a7.
