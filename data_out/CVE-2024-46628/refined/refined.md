Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `formSetUSBPartitionUmount` function of the Tenda G3 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The router fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `usbPartitionName` parameter in an HTTP POST request. This allows for command injection.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious commands within the `usbPartitionName` parameter, which the router then executes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to full control of the router.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker gains administrative-level privileges on the router.
*   **Network Access:** This can result in unauthorized access to the network the router is connected to.
*   **Further Attacks:** The compromised router can be used as a launchpad for attacks on other devices connected to the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/umountUSBPartition` endpoint.
*   **Command Injection:**  Malicious commands are injected through the `usbPartitionName` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Tenda G3 router.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not show any authentication being bypassed.
*   **Target System Must Be Vulnerable:** The target router must be running the affected firmware version (V15.03.05.05)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof of concept uses the `telnetd` command to further establish a reverse shell, showing full control over the system.
*   The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific exploit steps and impact information.
