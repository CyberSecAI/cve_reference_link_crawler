- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to visit specific web pages containing malicious payloads after sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device.
