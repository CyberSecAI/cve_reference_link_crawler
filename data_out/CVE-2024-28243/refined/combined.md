# maxExpand bypassed by \edef

Moderate

[edemaine](/edemaine)
published
GHSA-64fm-8hw2-v72w
Mar 24, 2024

## Package

npm

katex
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= v0.10.0-beta, < 0.16.10

## Patched versions

0.16.10

## Description

### Impact

KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability attack, where e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable to use the site due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow.

### Patches

Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Forbid inputs containing the substring `"\\edef"` before passing them to KaTeX.

(There is no easy workaround for the auto-render extension.)

### Details

KaTeX supports an option named `maxExpand` which prevents infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. However, what counted as an "expansion" is a single macro expanding to any number of tokens. The expand-and-define TeX command `\edef` can be used to build up an exponential number of tokens using only a linear number of expansions according to this definition, e.g. by repeatedly doubling the previous definition. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10, where every expanded token in an `\edef` counts as an expansion.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue or security advisory in the [KaTeX repository](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

fix: \edef bypassing maxExpand via exponential blowup

```
Modify `\edef`, and `expandTokens` more generally, to count the number
of tokens in the entire expansion instead of just 1.  This prevents
exponential blowup in the expanded tokens via a linear number of `\edef`
and apparent expansions.

Specifies a minimum thickness, in ems, for fraction lines, `\sqrt` top lines, `{array}` vertical lines, `\hline`, `\hdashline`, `\underline`, `\overline`, and the borders of `\fbox`, `\boxed`, and `\fcolorbox`. The usual value for these items is `0.04`, so for `minRuleThickness` to be effective it should probably take a value slightly above `0.04`, say `0.05` or `0.06`. Negative values will be ignored. |
|  |  | - `colorIsTextColor`: `boolean`. In early versions of both KaTeX (<0.8.0) and MathJax, the `\color` function expected the content to be a function argument, as in `\color{blue}{hello}`. In current KaTeX, `\color` is a switch, as in `\color{blue} hello`. This matches LaTeX behavior. If you want the old `\color` behavior, set option `colorIsTextColor` to true. |

Provide a custom function `handler(errorCode, errorMsg, token)` to customize behavior depending on the type of transgression (summarized by the string code `errorCode` and detailed in `errorMsg`); this function can also return `"ignore"`, `"error"`, or `"warn"` to use a built-in behavior.
