Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6522:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, particularly from Wordfence, explicitly states that CVE-2024-6522 is related to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Modern Events Calendar plugin, versions 7.12.1 and below.  The vulnerable function is identified as 'mec\_fes\_form'. This aligns with the CVE description which mentions a server-side request forgery issue.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `mec_fes_form` AJAX function, which is susceptible to SSRF due to insufficient input sanitization and validation. This lack of proper checks allows an attacker to manipulate the function to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external resources.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use the SSRF to:
    *   Query information from internal services not meant to be public.
    *   Potentially modify data within internal services.
    *   Make requests to external servers using the server as a proxy, which could lead to further exploitation depending on the target.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `mec_fes_form` AJAX function, which is accessible to authenticated users. This implies the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the AJAX handler.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Subscriber" level privileges. This means that only users who have an account on the WordPress site with the vulnerable plugin installed and activated,  can exploit this issue.
    *  **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site.
    *  **Knowledge of the vulnerable function:**  The attacker needs to know about the existence and parameters for `mec_fes_form`.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions of the Modern Events Calendar plugin up to and including version 7.12.1
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 7.13.0 and above.
*   **Developer References:** The content references the vulnerable code in the plugin's source at `plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/modern-events-calendar-lite/trunk/app/features/fes.php#L54`.
*   **Specific Function:** The vulnerable AJAX call is `wp_ajax_mec_fes_form` and  `wp_ajax_nopriv_mec_fes_form`

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-6522 describes a high-severity Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Modern Events Calendar plugin. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with subscriber privileges or higher to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site, potentially leading to information disclosure or modification within the system or other systems it has access to. The root cause is insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied input within the  `mec_fes_form` AJAX function. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.13.0 and users of older versions are encouraged to update.
