## Description

Twister Antivirus v8.17 is vulnerable to
an Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability by triggering the
`0x801120B8` IOCTL code of the `filmfd.sys` driver.

## Vulnerability

The `0x801120B8` IOCTL code of the `filmfd.sys` driver
driver allows to perform a Out-of-bounds read of a page
which is allocated next to the vulnerable buffer.
When issuing a `0x801120B8` IOCTL request with
NULL `lpInBuffer` and a short `lpOutBuffer`,
the out-of-bounds read occur at `filmfd+0xf3f8`
when trying to dereference `0x420` bytes from the
`lpOutBuffer` buffer which is controlled by the user.
This leads to a Denial of Service if the dereferenced
address contains invalid memory. If the attacker can
control the allocation of objects adjacent to the
vulnerable buffer, this may be upgraded to a
more powerful primitive.

The resulting debugging session is the following:

```
0: kd> bp filmfd+0xf3f8 ".printf \"rax = 0x%p\", @rax; .echo; dps rax+420 L1; .echo; gc"
0: kd> g
rax = 0xffffa28408942640
ffffa284`08942a60  00000000`00000000

rax = 0xffffa2840be6ed00
ffffa284`0be6f120  00000000`00000000

rax = 0xffffa28407da4a40
ffffa284`07da4e60  00000000`00000000

rax = 0xffffa28407ea0d00
ffffa284`07ea1120  ffffa284`0b948158

rax = 0xffffa2840b941d00
ffffa284`0b942120  ????????`????????

A fatal system error has occurred.

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except.
Typically the address is just plain bad or it is pointing at freed memory.
Arguments:
Arg1: ffffd40cdd345220, memory referenced.
Arg2: 0000000000000000, X64: bit 0 set if the fault was due to a not-present PTE.
    bit 1 is set if the fault was due to a write, clear if a read.
    bit 3 is set if the processor decided the fault was due to a corrupted PTE.
    bit 4 is set if the fault was due to attempted execute of a no-execute PTE.
    - ARM64: bit 1 is set if the fault was due to a write, clear if a read.
    bit 3 is set if the fault was due to attempted execute of a no-execute PTE.
Arg3: ffffd40cdd344e10, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
    address.

Twister Antivirus will be interesting program, we will include you program in the CD-ROM magazine, with a space on the covermount CD and on the cover also. - HAKIN9.ORG Customer ReviewI can not stop talking to my friends how pleased I am with Twister. Before I decided to try your product, I tried Norton, Avast, McAfee, Kaspersky, and I do not remember a couple others more which. I tried them on a badly infected computer. At the last I gave Twister a try and found another 12 Trojans/virus left over after all the other programs finished scanning and repairing the computer. That was enough for me to buy 3 twisters. - John PapazoglouShare   \* 1 year for 1 PC license: With this service, you receive the right to use this product on one PC during the service period, which begins upon initial installation.
