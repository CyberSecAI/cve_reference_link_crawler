- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `doSystem` function, which executes system commands based on user-supplied input from the `SystemCommand` component. The function utilizes `websGetVar` to retrieve the command from the HTTP request, which is then passed to `snprintf` and subsequently to `doSystem` without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Command injection: The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. User-controlled data passed through the HTTP `command` parameter is directly used in a system command without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.
  - Lack of input validation: The code fails to sanitize or validate the input received through the `command` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Complete system compromise: An attacker can achieve complete control of the device by injecting and executing arbitrary commands, including enabling telnet access and potentially installing malware.
  - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact: Exploiting the vulnerability could lead to a breach of confidentiality, manipulation of the device's functions, and disruption of its availability.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - HTTP POST request: The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/SystemCommand` with a malicious command in the `command` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the device's web interface to send the malicious HTTP requests.
  - No Authentication Needed: The vulnerability does not require prior authentication, making it easier to exploit.
