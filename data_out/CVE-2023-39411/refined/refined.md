- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Intel Unison software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction required
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A privileged user with local access and need user interaction (UI) for exploitation.

The advisory states: "Improper input validationation for some Intel® Unison™ software may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access." The CVSS vector confirms that the attack vector is local, user interaction is required, and the impact is a denial of service.
