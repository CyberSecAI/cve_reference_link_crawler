# DOS via issue preview and markdown preview

**[HackerOne report #1543718](https://hackerone.com/reports/1543718)** by `legit-security` on 2022-04-18, assigned to [@kmorrison1](/kmorrison1 "Kevin Morrison"):

There were two additional reports by the same team which, since this was imported first, are being treated as duplicates due to [sharing the same root cause](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362379#note_955779025 "DOS via move_issue")

* Unauthed via Markdown Preview API: <https://hackerone.com/reports/1544465>
* REDoS via create/update issue: <https://hackerone.com/reports/1543606>

A fourth report, DoS via moving an issue, has a separate cause and separate issue: [DOS via move\_issue (#362379 - closed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362379 "DOS via move_issue") / <https://hackerone.com/reports/1543584>

[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

Unauthenticated requests to the markdown preview API `/api/v4/markdown` and authenticated previewing of an issue with a specially-crafted description results in high CPU usage for 60 seconds (request timeout).

Multiple requests can be issued in parallel to create a larger impact.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Given an authorized user (on GitLab.com - anyone can self-register. On EE - depends on instance configuration).
2. Create an issue with the following description (provided a one-line python script to avoid bloating):
3. Hit the preview button.

Steps 2&3 can be accomplished via the preview\_markdown API endpoint.

The script:

`python -c "print('![l' * int(1048576 / 3 - 1) + '\n')"`

Note: this is essentially the maximal description size, but a smaller number of repetitions works too.

##### Impact

After 60 seconds (timeout) - the request fails.

Meanwhile, on the server end, (a single) CPU is burnt out (verified against a local EE instance).

Issuing multiple requests in parallel results in multiple CPUs burn out.

Using the DockerHub image, the entire server is completely unavailable by repeatedly sending a small number of requests repeatedly.

##### Examples

The bug is instance-independent, works on latest versions. Since GitLab.com is open-core - it would work on GitLab too.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The HTTP request fails for timeout while the server is burning CPU.

On the code side:

`texts_and_contexts` is being initialized here:

```
def analyze(text, context = {})
      [@]texts_and_contexts << { text: text, context: context }
    end
```

It is then used at banzai/reference\_extractor.rb:

```
def html_documents
      ...
      [@]html_documents ||= Renderer.cache_collection_render([@]texts_and_contexts)
      ...
```

The CPU utilization is found in the execution of `cache_collection_render`.

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Fix the implementation of `cache_collection_render`.

##### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

##### Output of checks

###### Results of GitLab environment info

#### Impact

A complete denial of service of a GitLab EE instance.

As this vulnerability impacts GitLab.com, we assume that this vulnerability opens the door for a DDOS attack.

## How To Reproduce
