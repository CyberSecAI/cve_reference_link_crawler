{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `cache_collection_render` function within the Banzai Markdown rendering library. When processing a specially crafted markdown description, this function leads to excessive CPU usage.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability within the markdown processing logic that gets triggered by a large number of repetitions in the markdown text. The vulnerability is triggered when the markdown text contains a large number of `![l` sequences.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS). A single request can cause high CPU usage for 60 seconds, leading to a timeout. Multiple parallel requests can burn out multiple CPU cores, potentially rendering the entire GitLab server unavailable. This vulnerability can be exploited on GitLab.com as well as self-managed GitLab instances, making it a DDOS threat.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the markdown preview API (`/api/v4/markdown`) which can be accessed unauthenticated, and through issue preview when authenticated. Specifically, by creating a new issue, or editing an existing one and hitting the preview button, using a maliciously crafted payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without authentication by making requests to the markdown preview API or by creating a user account and submitting a malicious markdown text when creating or editing an issue. The attacker doesn't need a special position or any elevated privileges."
