Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31450:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `DeleteCustomEmoji` function within `controllers/admin/emoji.go`. The application directly appends a user-supplied `name` parameter from a JSON request to a file path when deleting a custom emoji. This allows attackers to use path traversal sequences like `../` to access and delete files outside of the intended emoji directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided for the emoji name, allowing a malicious user to manipulate the file path.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `emoji.Name` is taken directly from the request body without sanitization before being used in `filepath.Join`.
- **Direct File System Interaction:** The `os.Remove` function operates directly with the file system, making it vulnerable to path traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker could delete any file on the system that the Owncast process has permissions to access.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker with administrative privileges can send a POST request to the `/api/admin/emoji/delete` endpoint with a crafted JSON payload containing a malicious file path in the `name` parameter using path traversal sequences, allowing the deletion of arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the `/api/admin/emoji/delete` endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Owncast server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check using `filepath.IsLocal(targetPath)` to ensure the path remains within the intended directory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by a GitHub CodeQL team member using a path injection query.
- The affected version is v0.1.2 of Owncast.
- The fix was introduced in commit `1b14800c7d7f54be14ed4d130bfe7f480645076e`.
