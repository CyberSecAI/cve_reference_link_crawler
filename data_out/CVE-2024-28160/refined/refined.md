Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-28160:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `iceScrum` Plugin does not sanitize iceScrum project URLs on build views. This means that if a malicious URL is injected, it won't be properly escaped, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when a user views the build page.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of input sanitization/output escaping for iceScrum project URLs displayed on build views.

**Impact:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when viewing a build page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the Jenkins UI
    - Phishing attacks
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with the ability to configure jobs can inject a malicious iceScrum project URL.
- When a user views the build page that contains this malicious URL, the injected JavaScript will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs "Item/Configure" permission for a Jenkins job that utilizes the `iceScrum` plugin.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the iceScrum project URL configuration of the job.

**Affected Plugin:** `iceScrum` Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.1.6 and earlier

**Fix:** As of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
The content explicitly states that the vulnerability is "stored" XSS, which means the malicious payload is saved within the Jenkins system and served to users when they browse the relevant page.
The severity is marked as High with a CVSS score of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
