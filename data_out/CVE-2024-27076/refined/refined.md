The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `imx-media-csc-scaler.c` driver within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the memory allocated for the `v4l2_ctrl_handler` was not being freed upon release of the device, leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by failure to free memory allocated for `v4l2_ctrl_handler` when the IPU CSC scaler device is released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource Exhaustion: Repeated allocation of memory without freeing it can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the system to become unstable or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Device Interaction: An attacker needs to interact with the imx csc/scaler device by repeatedly opening and releasing it, thus triggering the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the device: The attacker must have the ability to open and release the imx csc/scaler device, which typically requires local access to the system.

The provided patches fix the issue by adding a call to `v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(&ctx->ctrl_hdlr)` in the `ipu_csc_scaler_release` function, thus ensuring that the allocated memory is properly freed on device release.
