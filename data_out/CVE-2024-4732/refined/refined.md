Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application echoes user-supplied input from the `name` parameter on the `/admin/service` page directly into the HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data before embedding it into the HTML.
*   **Direct Output to HTML:** The `name` parameter is directly reflected in the HTML response, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the page.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected code can be used to steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data can be stolen using Javascript to send information to an attacker controlled server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/service` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated `name` Parameter:** The `name` parameter in the POST request is set to a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `<img src=1 onerror="alert(document.cookie)">`.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The malicious payload is echoed back in the response, resulting in the execution of the JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the malicious POST request.
*   **Target Access:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint, parameters, and the application to manipulate it.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected URL:** `/admin/service`
*   **Affected Parameter:** `name`
*   **Vulnerable Product:** Campcodes Legal Case Management System
*   **Vulnerable Version:** 1.0
*   **Proof-of-Concept Payload:** `<img src=1 onerror="alert(document.cookie)">`
