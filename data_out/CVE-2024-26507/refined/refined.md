Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The AIDA Kernel Driver does not validate data received from the IRP->SystemBuffer when handling IOCTL code `0x80112104`. This allows a user-controlled physical address and size to be directly passed to the `MmMapIoSpace` function without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The driver fails to validate the physical address and size parameters received in the IRP System Buffer. This lack of validation enables an attacker to control the memory region to be mapped.
*   **Direct Use of User-Supplied Data:** The driver directly uses the attacker-supplied physical address and size in calls to `MmMapIoSpace`, `IoAllocateMdl`, `MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool`, and `MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An unprivileged user can achieve privilege escalation to NT SYSTEM level. By controlling the physical address, an attacker can map kernel memory into a user space address, allowing them to read and potentially write kernel memory. This enables the attacker to overwrite the current process token and gain SYSTEM level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a local attack, where an unprivileged user sends a specially crafted IOCTL request to the AIDA Kernel Driver (specifically, IOCTL code `0x80112104`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to execute code as a low-privileged user on the system where the vulnerable AIDA driver is loaded. No network access is required as the exploit is local.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `AllocatePageMdl` function, called by the IOCTL dispatch handler for `0x80112104`.
*   The function receives a physical address and size from the IRP's `SystemBuffer` without validation.
*   It then uses these values to map physical memory into the system's virtual address space using `MmMapIoSpace`.
*   The function creates a MDL and maps the memory to a user-mode buffer.
*   The attacker can use this mapped user-mode address to scan for the current process token and overwrite it with a SYSTEM token.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in February 2024 and assigned CVE-2024-26507.
*   No fix has been released for this vulnerability.
*   Proof of concept code and a YouTube video demonstrating the exploit have been published.
