The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36969.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `setup_dsc_config` function of the AMD GPU driver. Specifically, the `dsc_cfg->num_slices_v` is calculated by dividing `pic_height` by `slice_height`. If `slice_height` is 0, this results in a division-by-zero error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division-by-zero error: The code lacks a check to ensure that `slice_height` is not zero before performing the division operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: A division-by-zero error will result in a kernel crash which leaves the system in a state that requires a reboot.
- System instability: The system becomes unstable, requiring manual intervention to recover.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the amdgpu driver attempts to configure the display with a `slice_height` of 0. This is typically caused by a monitor connected via Thunderbolt.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger a scenario where the amdgpu driver configures the display such that `slice_height` is 0. This can happen during a reboot with specific monitor setups.
