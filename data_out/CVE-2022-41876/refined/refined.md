- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GraphQL schema for user accounts exposed password hashes, and potentially other sensitive user information like hash type, email, and login.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (password hashes) through GraphQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve password hashes of users who have created or modified content, which can be used for password cracking or gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated GraphQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required for this vulnerability.
