Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-31014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the game launcher component of the NVIDIA GeForce NOW for Android application. A malicious application on the same device can intercept and process an implicit intent that was intended for the streamer component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of implicit intents, allowing a malicious application to intercept and process intents meant for another component.
- Insecure intent handling leading to potential for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can lead to:
  - Limited information disclosure: The malicious application may gain access to sensitive data intended for the streamer component.
  - Denial of service: The malicious application can disrupt the functionality of the streamer component.
  - Code execution: The malicious application might be able to execute arbitrary code within the context of the GeForce NOW application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application installed on the same Android device as the vulnerable GeForce NOW application.
- Exploiting the vulnerability requires the malicious application to be capable of processing implicit intents and specifically intercepting the intent meant for the streamer component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the same Android device as the vulnerable NVIDIA GeForce NOW application.
- The attacker needs to craft the malicious application to intercept the implicit intent used by the streamer component.
- The attacker needs a low privilege level (PR:L), needs a user interaction (UI:R) and access within the same local system (AV:L).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-927, which refers to "Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication".
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 4.2, with the vector string being AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
- NVIDIA recommends updating to version 6.05.33200069 of the GeForce NOW for Android app to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Oversecured.
