Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `todesk v1.1` application. Specifically, the `title` parameter in the `/news.html` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization when handling the `title` parameter in the `/todesk.com/news.html` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is information disclosure. By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/todesk.com/news.html` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special access to the server is needed beyond basic network connectivity.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example attack vector is: accessing `<https://todesk.com/news.html?tag_id=&title=1>' AND (SELECT 6268 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))ghXo) AND 'IKlK'='IKlK`. This payload attempts to inject a SQL `SLEEP` command and test for SQL injection through conditional logic.
- The vulnerability is located in `todesk v1.1` at the `/todesk.com/news.html` endpoint and is exploited through the `title` parameter.
- The `tag_id` parameter is also included in the provided attack vector but doesn't seem to be vulnerable as per the description.
