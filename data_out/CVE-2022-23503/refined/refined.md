- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of separation between user-submitted data and internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, allowing code injection via TypoScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection vulnerability via TypoScript processing of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary PHP code execution, leading to complete compromise of the application (High Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting the Form Designer backend module
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - A valid backend user account with access to the form module.
    - Ability to manipulate form definitions, specifically the `formDefinitionOverrides`.
