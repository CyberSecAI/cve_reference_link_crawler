- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflows in the `_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid` function when handling HTTP POST requests to `/data/scheduler.association.json`. Specifically, the `strcpy_until` function does not perform bounds checking when copying data into stack-allocated buffers (`ssid_copy`, `profile_copy`, `action_copy`, `band_copy`) based on the `ssid`, `profile`, `action`, and `band` parameters, leading to overflows. Additionally, `strncpy` calls used to copy data from the `_copy` buffers into the `wrpOpDo_params` structure can also lead to overflows, with the `ssid` and `profile` parameters being particularly dangerous on EAP225 due to their location on the stack. On EAP115 these copies are performed to a pointer which can be overwritten to achieve arbitrary writes.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking in `strcpy_until` and `strncpy`
    - Lack of input sanitization on POST parameters

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote code execution by overwriting return address on the stack.
    - Potential for arbitrary writes on EAP115 via a write-what-where primitive.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/data/scheduler.association.json` with overly long values for the `ssid`, `profile`, `action`, and/or `band` parameters.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated user with administrative privileges to the web interface.
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to the device.
