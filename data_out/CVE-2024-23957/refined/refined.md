- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `DLB_HostHeartBeat` handler of the DLB protocol implementation, specifically when parsing an AES key. The process fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation of the AES key length.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging station.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-adjacent and targets the DLB protocol implementation. No authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the charging station. No specific capabilities are mentioned beyond network access and the ability to craft malicious DLB protocol messages.
