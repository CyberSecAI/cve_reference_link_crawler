Due to a failure in validating the length of a provided MQTT_CMD_PUBLISH parsed message with a variable length header, Cesanta Mongoose, an embeddable web server, version 7.10 is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the default configuration. Version 7.9 and prior does not appear to be vulnerable. This issue is resolved in version 7.11.
