The provided content relates to CVE-2024-30312.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the processing of embedded font files within Adobe Acrobat Reader. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the handling of the Color Palette Table (`CPAL`) of OpenType fonts, when the value of `max(colorRecordIndices) + numPaletteEntries` is greater than `numColorRecords`. This can happen when the `colorRecordIndices` array contains an index that, when combined with the number of palette entries, exceeds the bounds of the allocated buffer for color records.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125): The vulnerability allows reading memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This happens because the code does not properly validate the computed index when accessing the `colorRecordBuf`, resulting in reading from an arbitrary memory address.
- Insufficient input validation: The software fails to properly validate the values within the CPAL table, which leads to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: The out-of-bounds read can disclose sensitive information from the application's memory. This information could potentially aid in further exploitation or bypass exploit mitigations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted font file embedded within a PDF document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PDF document containing the specially crafted font. This requires user interaction.
- The attack can be triggered locally.
