{
  "CVE-2023-39379": {
    "Root cause": "The Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) stores the proxy server password in cleartext within the product's maintenance data (ismsnap). This occurs when using a proxy server with authentication, where the user ID or password contains a backslash character, and the firmware download function is enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
    ],
    "Impact": "The proxy server password configured in ISM can be retrieved from the maintenance data.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to have access to the maintenance data (ismsnap). The analysis assumes the attacker directs the administrator to collect this data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs local access with low privileges to the system or have access to the maintenance data. Also, user interaction (having the admin collect the data) may be required."
