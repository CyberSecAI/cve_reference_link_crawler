## üö® Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites‚Äô `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy:¬†frame-ancestors¬†'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.

## üéâ¬†Features

* Added Rumanian translation (thanks to [@danburzo](https://github.com/danburzo)) üéâ

* `collection()`¬†helper (and corresponding methods) allow passing an¬†`$options`¬†array which will be provided as additional arguments to the collection closure (thanks to¬†[@ceesvanegmond](https://github.com/ceesvanegmond))
  ```
  <?php

  // site/controller/news.php
  $articles = collection('news', ['order' => 'asc']);

  // site/collection/news.php
  use Kirby\Cms\Site;
