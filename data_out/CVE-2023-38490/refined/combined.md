## 🚨 Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.

## 🚨 Security release

This release fixes several vulnerabilities that were all responsibly reported to us in June 2023:

* [Insufficient Session Expiration after a password change](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-5mvj-rvp8-rf45) (high severity, CVSS score 7.3)
* [Field injection in the KirbyData text storage handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mr-p6v4-wp93) (high severity, CVSS score 7.1)
* [XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp) (medium severity, CVSS score 6.8)
* [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.7)
* [Denial of service from unlimited password lengths](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3v6j-v3qc-cxff) (medium severity, CVSS score 5.3)

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.

# XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML data handler

Moderate

[bastianallgeier](/bastianallgeier)
published
GHSA-q386-w6fg-gmgp
Jul 27, 2023

## Package

composer

getkirby/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=3.5.8.2, 3.6.0-3.6.6.2, 3.7.0-3.7.5.1, 3.8.0-3.8.4, 3.9.0-3.9.5

## Patched versions

3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, 3.9.6

## Description

### TL;DR

This vulnerability only affects Kirby sites that use the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) or the `Xml::parse()` method in site or plugin code. The Kirby core does not use any of the affected methods.

If you use an affected method and cannot rule out XML input controlled by an attacker, we strongly recommend to update to a patch release.

---

### Introduction

XML External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the XML markup language that allows to include data from external files in an XML structure. If the name of the external file can be controlled by an attacker, this becomes a vulnerability that can be abused for various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to perform network requests on behalf of the server (server-side request forgery, SSRF).

### Impact

Kirby's `Xml::parse()` method used PHP's `LIBXML_NOENT` constant, which enabled the processing of XML external entities during the parsing operation.

The `Xml::parse()` method is used in the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`).

Both the vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the Kirby core. However they may be used in site or plugin code, e.g. to parse RSS feeds or other XML files. If those files are of an external origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from an external URL), attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML file that will then be processed in the parsing process.

Kirby sites that don't use XML parsing in site or plugin code are *not* affected.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3), [Kirby 3.6.6.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3), [Kirby 3.7.5.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2), [Kirby 3.8.4.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1) and [Kirby 3.9.6](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.

In all of the mentioned releases, we have removed the `LIBXML_NOENT` constant as processing of external entities is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses of the method against the described vulnerability.

### Credits

Thanks to Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issue.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)), Alexandre Zanni ([@noraj](https://github.com/noraj)) at [ACCEIS](https://www.acceis.fr/) and Patrick Falb ([@dapatrese](https://github.com/dapatrese)) at [FORMER 03](https://former03.de/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues.

### Updated default `.htaccess`

We have updated the `.htaccess` that ships with our kits to the new version `2023-07-22`, which adds protection against browser MIME type detection from malicious file uploads for files that have already been copied to the `media` folder. We recommend to update your sites’ `.htaccess` or server configuration with the new changes if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users or if your sites allow file uploads by visitors and the file extensions of uploaded files are not limited to a fixed safe list.

You can find the changes to the `.htaccess` [in this commit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/commit/db49a55c00e7bccea28556a98429130e69ce6184) and read more about the added rules [in the security guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/security#secure-your-server__disable-mime-type-detection).

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for making us aware of this potential attack vector.

### Frame-blocking in the Panel

The Panel now sends the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header to increase the protection against clickjacking attacks. The session cookie was already set to `SameSite` before, so this is an additional layer of protection.

Thanks to Shankar Acharya ([@5hank4r](https://github.com/5hank4r)) for suggesting this security enhancement.

### Security-related breaking changes

* All users are logged out from their sessions after updating to this patch release.
* The `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) and the `Xml::parse()` method no longer process XML external entities.
* The Panel can no longer be embedded in HTML frames.
