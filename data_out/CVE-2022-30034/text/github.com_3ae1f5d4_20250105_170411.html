| Ref: <https://tprynn.github.io/2022/05/26/flower-vulns.html>   * Flower is unauthenticated by default and lacks CSRF protections * Flower's OAuth support is vulnerable to a bypass allowing anyone to authenticate regardless of the `auth_regex` restriction   Due to a lack of response from the maintainer, these issues were publicly disclosed on 26 May 2022 along with a PR ([#1216](https://github.com/mher/flower/pull/1216)) |

| * Flower is unauthenticated by default and lacks CSRF protections  Actually flower has an option for CRSF protection <https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#cookie-secret>  * Flower's OAuth support is vulnerable to a bypass allowing anyone to authenticate regardless of the `auth_regex` restriction  The vulnerabilities mentioned in the article can be prevented by more strict regular expressions. For example, `.*@example.com$` can be used to prevent authenticating with `attacker@example.com.attacker.com` |

| [@sebastian-philipp](https://github.com/sebastian-philipp) I've submitted an update to MITRE to have them mark the entry as fixed as of 1.2.0. It tends to take them some time to respond, but after they update the entry I think pip-audit should hopefully be able to notice it's fixed. |

| [@sebastian-philipp](https://github.com/sebastian-philipp) I'm sorry, I don't know exactly how the version info flows through the various DBs. Looking at pip-audit's [docs](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) it seems like the source should be <https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database> but I didn't find any reference to the CVE / IDs there. I did submit a change to Github's advisory DB in case it's there: [github/advisory-database#666](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/666) |
