The provided content relates to CVE-2024-29900.

**Root Cause:**
A memory leak occurs due to the way the `@electron/packager` tool handles the integrity buffer. Specifically, when processing Asar integrity metadata, a segment of Node.js heap memory surrounding the integrity buffer was unintentionally copied into the final executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from improperly handling a buffer during the build process of an Electron application using `@electron/packager`.
- The root cause is due to dereferencing the `integrity buffer` in a way that includes adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information from the Node.js heap memory, such as environment variables and secrets files, can be leaked into the final executable.
- This leaked information could be extracted by an attacker who gains access to the executable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the build process itself. When a vulnerable version of `@electron/packager` is used, the memory leak is automatically introduced into the resulting executable during the build.
- An attacker would need access to the compiled application to potentially extract the leaked information

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the final executable built with the vulnerable version of `@electron/packager`.
- No specific attacker capabilities are described beyond the ability to access and analyze the resulting executable.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in version 18.3.1 of `@electron/packager`.
- There are no known workarounds other than updating to the patched version.
- The leaked memory is a random segment of approximately 1-10kb.
- The commit `d421d4bd3ced889a4143c5c3ab6d95e3be249eee` addresses the issue by correcting the buffer handling in `src/resedit.ts`. The fix ensures that only the necessary data is copied.
