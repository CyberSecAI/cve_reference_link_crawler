Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. This means that the system fails to properly sanitize or escape certain characters when constructing commands to be executed by the operating system.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** OS command injection (CWE-78) vulnerability in the command-line interpreter (CLI) of FortiWeb and FortiADC.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized commands on the underlying operating system, leading to potential compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via specifically crafted arguments to existing commands in the CLI.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the command line interpreter.
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   FortiADC versions: 7.1.0 through 7.1.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 and all versions from 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.4, 5.3, 5.2, and 5.1.
    *   FortiWeb versions: 7.0.0 through 7.0.3
*   **Solution:** Upgrade to the respective fixed version or migrate to a fixed release. FortiADC 7.1.2 or above and 7.0.4 or above. FortiWeb 7.0.4 or above
