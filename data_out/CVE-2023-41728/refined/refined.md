- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Rescue Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website, leading to redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads being executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through the plugin's shortcode functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the privilege to contribute to the WordPress site, which allows them to use the vulnerable shortcodes.
