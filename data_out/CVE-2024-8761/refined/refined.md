{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin uses a shortlink functionality that is vulnerable to open redirect due to insufficient validation of the redirect URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open Redirect"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can redirect users to arbitrary, potentially malicious, websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the 'link' parameter in the shortlink functionality.",
    "required_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL with a link parameter.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists within the `STI_Shortlink` class, specifically in the `ajax_add_link` and `redirects` methods. The `ajax_add_link` method does not sanitize the link URL before saving it into the database, and the `redirects` method uses this unsanitized link for redirection. The vulnerable code is located in `includes/class-sti-shortlink.php`. The fix was introduced in version 2.04, with changes to the `readme.txt` file and a number of new files and directories being added to the plugin."
