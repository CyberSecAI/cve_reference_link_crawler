- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `username` parameter within the `process.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly uses the `username` parameter in SQL queries without sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `username` parameter in the `process.php` file via HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `process.php` file, supplying malicious SQL code within the `username` parameter. No login or authorization is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
