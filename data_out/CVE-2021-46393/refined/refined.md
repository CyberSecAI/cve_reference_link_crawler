Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formSetPPTPServer` function within the Tenda AX3 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability occurs because the `v10` variable, derived from the `startIp` HTTP request parameter, is directly used in the `sscanf` function without any length checks. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the stack buffer overflow, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` endpoint.
- **`startIp` Parameter:** The malicious input is sent through the `startIp` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Tenda AX3 router to send the crafted HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/SetPptpServerCfg`) and the vulnerable parameter (`startIp`).
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious input string for `startIp` that exceeds the buffer size, allowing for RCE.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the Tenda AX3 router, specifically version V16.03.12.10\_CN.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) is provided in the content, using `requests` and `pwn` python libraries to demonstrate the exploitation. It shows that by sending a `startIp` parameter with a value of "a" repeated 1024 times results in a stack buffer overflow.
