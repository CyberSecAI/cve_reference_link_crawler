- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies within the backup task management functionality of the Synology Drive Client. Specifically, there's a flaw in how the application handles data during backup tasks, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local user with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have administrator privileges on the system where the Synology Drive Client is installed. The specific method of triggering the out-of-bounds write is not specified but it's related to the backup task management functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with administrator privileges on the system. No specific user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
