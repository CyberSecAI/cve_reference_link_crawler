Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `class_name` parameter of the `submit_enroll_student.php` file within the Kashipara College Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, enabling them to perform a variety of malicious actions.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Attackers could alter the content of the website, causing harm to the victim or the owner's reputation.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers can redirect users to sites that distribute malware, infecting the user's system without their knowledge.
*  **Data Theft/Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information or user session cookies leading to user account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `class_name` parameter of the `submit_enroll_student.php` file.
*  **Payload Example:** A sample payload provided is `class_name=BCA'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9240)</ScRiPt>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not necessarily need to be logged in to the application, depending on the access restrictions of the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and construct a suitable XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable version is stated to be `â‰¤1.0` of the College Management System.
*   The source code for the vulnerable system is publicly available on a specified website, although this specific URL is not directly a Github URL but rather the location of the software being examined.
*  The vulnerability was submitted by a user of VulDB, and the entry has been accepted.
