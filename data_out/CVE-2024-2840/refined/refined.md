{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Enhanced Media Library plugin for WordPress allows the upload of 'dfxp' files, which can contain malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with author-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that execute when a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim, potentially including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites, or further compromising the site.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the media upload functionality, specifically by uploading a malicious 'dfxp' file. The malicious payload is then stored and executed within the context of other users' browsers when they access the page containing the uploaded file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with author-level access or higher to upload the malicious 'dfxp' file to the media library."
