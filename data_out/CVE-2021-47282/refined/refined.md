The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47282.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `spi-bcm2835` driver used a statically sized array `prepare_cs[]` to store per-slave register values.
- The driver limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile time, however, the driver's `num_chipselect` was silently raised by `of_spi_get_gpio_numbers()` when GPIO chip selects were used.
- This resulted in out-of-bounds access to the `prepare_cs[]` array when more than 3 slaves were configured using GPIO chip selects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read/write due to a statically sized array.
- Incorrect handling of `num_chipselect` when GPIO chip selects are used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Out-of-bounds access, which could lead to undefined behavior, system instability, or potentially other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- Configuring more than 3 SPI slaves using GPIO chip selects in the device tree.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify the device tree to add more than 3 SPI slaves using GPIO chip selects.
