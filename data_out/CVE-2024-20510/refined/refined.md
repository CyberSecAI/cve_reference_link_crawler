- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error occurs when activating the pre-authentication ACL received from the AAA server during Central Web Authentication (CWA).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a pre-authentication ACL bypass. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can bypass the pre-authentication access control list (ACL), leading to unauthorized access to network resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass configured ACL protections before user authentication is complete, potentially accessing trusted networks that the device should be protecting. The overall impact is organization-specific, depending on the importance of the assets the ACL was intended to protect.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker connects to a wireless network configured for CWA and sends traffic through an affected device. The traffic, which should be denied by the pre-authentication ACL, is not blocked, allowing the attacker to bypass the ACL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be adjacent to the affected device, meaning they need to be within the wireless network's range. They must also connect to a wireless network using CWA on a vulnerable device and send traffic. No prior authentication is needed to perform the attack.
