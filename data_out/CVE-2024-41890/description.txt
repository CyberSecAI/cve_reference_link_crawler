Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Apache Answer.

This issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.3.5.

User sends multiple password reset emails, each containing a valid link. Within the link's validity period, this could potentially lead to the link being misused or hijacked.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.3.6, which fixes the issue.
