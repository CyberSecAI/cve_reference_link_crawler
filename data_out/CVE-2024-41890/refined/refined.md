- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing release of resource after effective lifetime. Specifically, old password reset links are not invalidated when a new password reset link is generated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Password reset links remain valid even after new reset links are generated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user could potentially have their password reset link misused or hijacked if an attacker intercepts an older link while a newer link is also valid.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker who has gained access to an old password reset link can use the link to change the victim's password. This could be achieved by intercepting the email, or via other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain an old password reset link before it expires. This could be achieved through access to the victim's emails or by intercepting network traffic.
