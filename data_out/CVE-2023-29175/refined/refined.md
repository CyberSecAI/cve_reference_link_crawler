- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation when establishing secure connections. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to lack of certificate verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper certificate validation [CWE-295] in FortiOS and FortiProxy.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the communication channel between the vulnerable device and the remote FortiGuard's map server. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely over the network. An attacker intercepts the communication between the vulnerable device and the FortiGuard map server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable device and the remote FortiGuard's map server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the device to conduct the MitM attack.
