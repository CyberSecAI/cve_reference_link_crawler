**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- When other users access the affected pages/functionalities, the injected script will execute in their browsers.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the osCommerce administration panel.
- The attacker manipulates specific parameters in various URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with the application to access the admin panel.
- An attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to access and modify configuration parameters that allow saving user input
- The attacker needs to identify and manipulate vulnerable parameters in the specified URLs using the malicious payload.
