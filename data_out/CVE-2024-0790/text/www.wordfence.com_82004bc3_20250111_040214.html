### Description

The WOLF – WordPress Posts Bulk Editor and Manager Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpbe\_create\_new\_term, wpbe\_update\_tax\_term, and wpbe\_delete\_tax\_term functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify and delete taxonomy terms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Furthermore, the functions wpbe\_save\_options, wpbe\_bulk\_delete\_posts\_count, wpbe\_bulk\_delete\_posts, and wpbe\_save\_meta are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing for plugin options update, post count deletion, post deletion and modification of post metadata via forged request.
