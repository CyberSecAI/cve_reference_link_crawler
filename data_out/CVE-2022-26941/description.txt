A format string vulnerability exists in Motorola MTM5000 series firmware AT command handler for the AT+CTGL command. An attacker-controllable string is improperly handled, allowing for a write-anything-anywhere scenario. This can be leveraged to obtain arbitrary code execution inside the teds_app binary, which runs with root privileges.
