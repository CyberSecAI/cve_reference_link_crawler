Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Tags" section under "Settings - Tags" in ConcreteCMS v.9.2.1.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they access a page displaying the crafted tags. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with access to the ConcreteCMS admin panel can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Tags field. The injected script will then be executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the ConcreteCMS admin panel.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to modify tags within the system settings.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit involves using a crafted `<img src=x:alert(alt) onerror=eval(src) alt='XSS Tags'>` payload.
* The vulnerability is reflected, meaning the malicious script is embedded within the page and executed when a user navigates to that page.
* The provided content includes images that showcase where the vulnerability exists and where the payload gets executed in the CMS.
