Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47333.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference in the `alcor_pci` driver when checking for ASPM (Active State Power Management) capabilities. Specifically, the code attempts to access `priv->parent_pdev` without checking if it's NULL, which can occur when a device is directly attached to the root complex (without a PCI bridge).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `alcor_pci_init_check_aspm` function attempts to dereference `priv->parent_pdev` without validating if it's NULL.
- Lack of input validation: The code doesn't properly validate if `priv->parent_pdev` is a valid pointer before using it, assuming it always points to a valid device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The null pointer dereference leads to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a device being attached directly to the root complex.
- The specific attack vector is loading the alcor_pci driver with such a device present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to load the alcor_pci kernel module with a device directly attached to the root complex, which typically requires root access.
- No specific network access is needed, as this is a local vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

The fix implemented in the patch involves adding a check to determine if `priv->parent_pdev` is NULL. If it is NULL, the ASPM capability check is skipped, and ASPM is effectively disabled for the device.
