{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a permission issue where non-project members with only guest access were able to promote key results to objectives, despite documentation specifying that at least the Reporter role was required for this action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect permission handling for the 'promote_to objective' action within the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) feature.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A non-project member can manipulate the structure of objectives by promoting key results to objectives, potentially causing confusion or disruption within a project's planning.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by a non-project member navigating to the key result details and using the `/promote_to objective` command within the comment box.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have guest access to the project and needs to know the URL for the key result."
