## Report

##### Summary

Hello,

As per this document `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/okrs.html#promote-a-key-result-to-an-objective`, You must require at least the `Reporter` role to promote the `key results` to `Objectives`.

[![Screenshot_2024-04-09_at_1.18.39_PM.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/0f6fcd89872a2f202dff55b186a47ccfca53d7a1/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f63323165366663622d626235662d343132392d623162612d6231363031623531653561652f53637265656e73686f745f323032342d30342d30395f61745f312e31382e33395f504d2e706e67)

However, only guest access is enough at the moment which i think is a permission issue.

##### Steps to reproduce

1.On your instance enable the feature flag `okrs_mvc` to enable `objectives and key results` in rail console. (Follow this to enable feature flags `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html#how-to-enable-and-disable-features-behind-flags`)

2.After enabling, go to `/issues` and create an objective. you can follow `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/okrs.html#create-an-objective` to create objective.

3.Once you create objective, you can create key results within objective in `Child Objectives and key results` section.

4.Login as `UserB` who is not a member of your group/project(public) and Now go to details of Key results `https://YourInstance/<GroupName>/<ProjectName>/-/work_items/1`.

5.In comment box type `/promote_to objective` and it will successfully convert key result into objective.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

As per document, you must need atleast reporter role to promote key results to objectives but non member too can do this

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Only reporter role user should be able to promote key results to objectives

##### Output of checks

Gitlab EE 16.9+

Regards,

Ashish

#### Impact

Non project member can promote key results to objectives
