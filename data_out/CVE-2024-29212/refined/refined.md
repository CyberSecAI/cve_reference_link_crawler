- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization method used by the Veeam Service Provider Console (VSPC) server in communication between the management agent and its components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the VSPC server machine.
- **Attack vectors**: Network communication between the VSPC management agent and its components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to communicate with the VSPC server through the management agent communication channel, and a low privileged user is enough for exploitation.

This content provides more specific details than the CVE description by specifying the unsafe deserialization as the root cause, the attack vector as communication between the management agent and its components, and that a low privilege is enough for exploitation.
