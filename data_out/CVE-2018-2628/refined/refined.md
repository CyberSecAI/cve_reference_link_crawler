{
  "CVE-2018-2628": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure deserialization of untrusted data in the Oracle WebLogic Server T3 interface.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "Remote code execution"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, targeting the Oracle WebLogic Server T3 interface.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle Weblogic Server and the ability to send serialized Java objects to the server's T3 interface."
    },

      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve remote command execution on the vulnerable Weblogic server.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via the T3 protocol of the Weblogic server, allowing for remote exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs network access to the Weblogic server and the ability to send malicious serialized Java objects."
