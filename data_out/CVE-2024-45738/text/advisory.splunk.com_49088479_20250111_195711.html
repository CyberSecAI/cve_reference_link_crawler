# Sensitive information disclosure in REST\_Calls logging channel

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-1008

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-45738](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45738)

**Published:** 2024-10-14

**Last Update:** 2024-10-14

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 4.9, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15407

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, the software potentially exposes sensitive HTTP parameters to the `_internal` index. This exposure could happen if you configure the Splunk Enterprise `REST_Calls` log channel at the DEBUG logging level.

The vulnerability would require either local access to the log files or administrative access to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. See [Define roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities) in the Splunk documentation for more information.

## Solution

There are multiple solutions depending on how you have configured the Splunk Enterprise instance `REST_Calls` log channel.

First, determine whether or not debug logging is on for the `REST_Calls` log channel. You must log into the Splunk Enterprise instance as an admin user or equivalent to perform these actions.To determine the log channel logging mode on the instance:
   1. In a web browser, visit the Server Logging Settings page in Splunk Web at `/en-US/manager/system/server/logger`.
   2. Review the Logging Level column on the page that loads. If the `REST_Calls` row in this column shows DEBUG as the logging level, then the Splunk Enterprise REST\_Call log channel is in debug mode. Otherwise, it is not in debug mode.
See [Enable debug logging](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Troubleshooting/Enabledebuglogging) for more information.

If the previous steps determine that debug logging is enabled in that log channel, then remedy the problem by performing the following tasks:
   1. Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3, 9.1.6, or higher.
   2. Delete the following log file on the Splunk Enterprise instance: `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`
   3. Delete all the Splunk Enterprise log file events for the `REST_Calls` component from the `_internal` index by running the following search command:
      `index=_internal component=REST_Calls | delete`

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.3 | splunkd | 9.3.0 | 9.3.1 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | splunkd | 9.2.0 to 9.2.2 | 9.2.3 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | splunkd | 9.1.0 to 9.1.5 | 9.1.6 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

If it isn’t currently possible to upgrade to a fixed version of Splunk Enterprise, you can remedy the vulnerability by doing the following:
   1. Configure the `REST_Calls` log channel to a logging level that is less verbose than DEBUG.
   2. Delete the following log file on the Splunk Enterprise instance: `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`
   3. Delete all of the Splunk Enterprise log file events for the `REST_Calls` component from the `_internal` index by running the following search command:
      `index=_internal component=REST_Calls | delete`
