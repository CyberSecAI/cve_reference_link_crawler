- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `messageId` parameter in the `/responsiveUI/EnvelopeOpenServlet` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The application directly includes the file content specified in the parameter into the HTML response, without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability leading to arbitrary file read, write, and delete. The application also does not require authentication to perform the request and is also vulnerable to arbitrary file write with `storeLoginChunkedImages` action.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive data like `/etc/passwd` and the Totemo license key.
    - **Arbitrary File Delete:** After returning the content of a file, the application deletes the file if it has sufficient permissions, leading to denial of service if important application files are deleted.
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** An unauthenticated attacker can write arbitrary files on the server using the `storeLoginChunkedImages` action
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/responsiveUI/EnvelopeOpenServlet` endpoint with a malicious `messageId` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Totemomail instance. No authentication is required.
