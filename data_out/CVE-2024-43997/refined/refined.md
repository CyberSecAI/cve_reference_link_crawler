- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EasyJobs WordPress plugin versions 2.4.14 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available in the plugin and the user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, performs an action within the vulnerable plugin. This is typically achieved by tricking the victim into clicking a link or visiting a website controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting the crafted malicious request. The attacker does not need any specific privileges, and the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
