Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JP2 files within Kofax Power PDF.
- Specifically, the issue stems from the lack of validation to ensure the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Use-After-Free: The description explicitly states the issue is a "Use-After-Free". This means a memory location is being accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
- Lack of object existence validation: The core problem is the software's failure to check if an object exists before attempting to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected systems.
- Potential Code Execution: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious File:  An attacker could craft a malicious JP2 file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious Page: The target must be lured into visiting a malicious page, presumably hosting the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- User Interaction:  The target user must either open a malicious JP2 file or visit a malicious web page.
- No special privileges required.
