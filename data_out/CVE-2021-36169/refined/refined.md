- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A debug functionality in FortiGate allows a privileged user to execute unauthorized code or commands via specific debug commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing privileged users to execute arbitrary code via debug commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges can execute unauthorized code or commands, potentially leading to a compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**:  Attackers exploit the vulnerability by using specific debug commands, which allows them to manipulate memory and execute unauthorized code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges to access the debug functionality.
