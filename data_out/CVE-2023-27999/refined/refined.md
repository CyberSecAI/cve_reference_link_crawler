- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input used as arguments in system commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection [CWE-78]. The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the system's command interpreter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute unauthorized commands on the system. This can potentially lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious arguments to existing commands through the FortiADC GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiADC GUI to exploit the vulnerability.
