## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1681
/
CVE-2019-16549 (XXE), CVE-2019-16550 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs.
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if itâ€™s not an HTTPS URL.

Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.2 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
It also now requires that requests to the connection test form validation method are done via POST, which protects from cross-site request forgery attacks.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin

**SECURITY-1527
/
CVE-2019-16551 (CSRF), CVE-2019-16552 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin allow ReDoS

**SECURITY-1651
/
CVE-2019-16553 (CSRF), CVE-2019-16554 (missing permission check), CVE-2019-16555 (resource consumption)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-failure-analyzer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer)**

**Description:**

Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular expression that will hang the request handling thread.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.2 requires POST requests and implements a permission check for the affected form validation methods so that only authorized users are able to submit regular expressions.

Additionally, the regular expression is implemented in an interruptible way, so that unintentionally expensive regular expression processing can be interrupted.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin

**SECURITY-1593
/
CVE-2019-16564**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-aggregator-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-aggregator-view)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the information shown on the view it provides, such as stage names or job names.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or otherwise affect the information shown by Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin.

Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.9 escapes user-controlled information on the view it provides.

### Rundeck Plugin stored credentials in plain text
