{
  "cve": "CVE-2024-43860",
  "affected_function": "imx_rproc_addr_init",
  "root_cause": "The function `imx_rproc_addr_init` in the imx_rproc driver iterates through phandles, using `of_parse_phandle` to retrieve device tree nodes. However, if a phandle is empty, `of_parse_phandle` can return NULL which is then dereferenced causing a null pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Null pointer dereference"
  ],
  "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference can cause a system crash or denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered if the device tree contains empty phandles in the memory-region property of the remoteproc device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the device tree configuration to include empty phandles. This could happen if an attacker controls the firmware or has a way to modify the device tree source."
