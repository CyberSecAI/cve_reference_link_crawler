Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-32864

**Vulnerability Description:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

**Root Cause:** The Johnson Controls exacqVision Web Service, in versions 24.03 and prior, does not consistently enforce secure web communications (HTTPS). Under certain circumstances, it may transmit sensitive information in cleartext, making it vulnerable to interception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for transmitting sensitive data without encryption.
*   **Lack of HTTPS Enforcement:** The web service fails to consistently enforce the use of HTTPS for secure communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept the communication between the web service and a client, gaining access to sensitive information.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information transmitted in cleartext can be viewed and potentially modified by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the web service and the client to intercept the communication.
*   **Passive Interception:** The attack can be executed passively by monitoring network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the traffic between the client and the vulnerable web service.
*   **Man-in-the-middle capability:** Ability to intercept and view network traffic

**Mitigation:**
*   **Upgrade:** Johnson Controls recommends upgrading to exacqVision Web Service version 24.06.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolating control system networks from business networks behind firewalls.
*   **VPN:** Using VPNs for secure remote access, but keeping VPN software updated and recognizing the connected devices are also part of the security posture.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.4 with a vector string of (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Diego Zaffaroni from Nozomi Networks.
*   Affected sectors include Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, and Energy.
