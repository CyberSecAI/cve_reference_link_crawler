Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads in the Mapplic Lite plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, SVG files) before storing and outputting it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within an SVG file.
- **Lack of input sanitization:**  The plugin does not adequately validate or remove potentially harmful code within uploaded SVG files.
- **Lack of output escaping:** The plugin does not encode the uploaded SVG file content when displaying it in a web page, which could prevent the execution of injected scripts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when the user accesses a page containing the malicious SVG file.
- **Account compromise:** By using the injected javascript, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially leading to account compromise or data theft.
- **Website defacement or redirection:** An attacker might be able to inject scripts to deface the website or redirect users to malicious pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated access:** Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Author" level privileges. This level of access is required to upload files using the plugin.
