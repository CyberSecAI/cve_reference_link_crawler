  "cveId": "CVE-2024-27074",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "A memory leak occurs in the `go7007_load_encoder` function within the Linux kernel's go7007 driver. Specifically, the `bounce` memory area (referenced by `go->boot_fw`) is allocated but not deallocated if an error occurs during firmware transfer or if the device fails to respond with the expected interrupt value. This happens in the following call chain: `saa7134_go7007_init` -> `go7007_boot_encoder` -> `go7007_load_encoder` -> `kfree(go)`. Because the memory is not freed before the `go` structure is deallocated, the `bounce` memory is leaked.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory leak"
      ],
      "impact": "A memory leak occurs, which over time, can lead to resource exhaustion and a potential denial-of-service condition.",
      "attackVectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the firmware transfer in the `go7007_load_encoder` function fails or the expected interrupt value from the device isn't received.",
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to cause an error during the firmware transfer or make the device fail to respond with the correct interrupt value. This is likely triggered by an issue with the connected hardware or by disrupting the communication with it, potentially through a malicious device or by causing a malfunction of the device."
