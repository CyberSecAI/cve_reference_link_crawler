Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Mirrored regions with different values within the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.
*   **Weakness:** Inconsistency in mirrored regions can be exploited by a privileged user.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system.

**Summary of Technical Details**
The vulnerability lies within the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, specifically within memory regions that are mirrored. If these mirrored regions contain different values, a privileged user can exploit this to cause a denial of service. Intel is releasing microcode updates to address this issue. The affected products are the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors with the CPU ID 5065B and platform ID 0xBF, and the platform is Cedar Island.

The provided CVSS scores are:
*   **CVSS v3.1:** 6.0 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
*   **CVSS v4.0:** 6.7 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.

The advisory also provides mitigation guidance, stating that users should update to the latest microcode version provided by the system manufacturer.
