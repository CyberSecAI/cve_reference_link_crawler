PingOne MFA Integration Kit contains a vulnerability where the skipMFA action can be configured such that user authentication does not require the second factor authentication from the user's existing registered devices. A threat actor might be able to exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as a target user if they have existing knowledge of the target user’s first-factor credentials.
