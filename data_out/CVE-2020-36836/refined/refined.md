Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper capability checks and insufficient path validation within the WP Fastest Cache plugin. Specifically, the plugin failed to sanitize user-supplied file paths when deleting cache files. The plugin did not check for and remove `../` from the user controlled path values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Authenticated users, even with minimal privileges (subscriber role and higher), could delete arbitrary files and directories on the server.
*   **Insufficient Path Validation:** The plugin did not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied paths, allowing directory traversal using `../`.
*   **CSRF:** The vulnerability is exploitable via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), meaning an attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing a malicious action without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Website Deletion:** An attacker could potentially delete the entire WordPress installation, including backups, due to the ability to traverse directories using `../` in the path.
*   **Data Loss:** The ability to delete arbitrary files and directories can lead to significant data loss and disruption of service.
*   **Availability Impact:** The exploitation can lead to the website being completely non-functional, causing severe availability issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is initiated over the network.
*   **CSRF:** A malicious HTML page can be crafted to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint which will delete files based on the parameters provided in the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account with a minimum subscriber role.
*   **User Interaction (CSRF):** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page that executes the CSRF attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to target the affected website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable function was `wpfc_delete_current_page_cache()`.
*   The fix involved adding `nonce_verify()` to the `delete_current_page_cache()` function.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 0.9.0.2.
*   The patched version is 0.9.0.3.
*   The issue was reported to the plugin author on 2020-01-28 and fixed the same day and released a patch on 2020-02-05.
