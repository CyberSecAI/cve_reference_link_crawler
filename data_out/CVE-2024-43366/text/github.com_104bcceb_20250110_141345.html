# Ignored loop range bounds

Moderate

[hedgar2017](/hedgar2017)
published
GHSA-8j77-7rrv-6pxx
Aug 13, 2024

## Package

zkvyper
(Vyper)

## Affected versions

>=1.3.12, <1.5.3

## Patched versions

1.5.3

## Description

### Impact

The `bound` parameter of loop ranges in Vyper v0.3.10 and newer is ignored, as it is represented by a previously unused parameter of the LLL `repeat` instruction.

In the example below, `bound` is supposed to break the loop if `stop >= 2`, allowing to use variables in Vyper as a Turing-incomplete language.

```
@external
def foo(stop: uint256) -> uint256:
    x: uint256 = 0
    for i:uint256 in range(stop, bound = 2):
        x = i
    return x
```

Since LLL IR has no Turing-incompletness restrictions, it is compiled to a loop with a much more late exit condition. It leads to a loss of funds or other unwanted behavior if the loop body contains it.

However, more real-life use cases like iterating over an array are not affected. For instance, in the example below, an array length constant is used, which is less or equal to the constant provided as `bound`.

```
my_array: DynArray[uint256, MAX_LEN]
for i: uint256 in range(len(my_array), bound=MAX_LEN):
    ...
```

No contracts were affected, but some of them had patterns similar to the 2nd example.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.5.3.

### Workarounds

Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43366

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
