Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-24785:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `html/template` package in Go does not correctly handle errors returned from `MarshalJSON` methods when those errors contain user-controlled data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper contextual auto-escaping:** The package fails to properly escape user-controlled data within errors from `MarshalJSON`, which are then placed within HTML comments.
- **Insufficient input sanitization**: The package does not sanitize/escape HTML comment terminators (`*/`) or script/comment tags (`</script>` and `<!--`) that may be present within user-controlled error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Injection of unexpected content:** An attacker can inject arbitrary content into the generated HTML by manipulating the error messages returned by the `MarshalJSON` method. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other unwanted content being injected in the page.
- **Break auto-escaping:** The ability to inject unexpected content via `MarshalJSON` errors bypasses the existing contextual auto-escaping mechanisms of `html/template`

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control data that will be returned by the `MarshalJSON` method of an object that will be parsed by the `html/template` package. This could be done indirectly by controlling a database, file, or external API that provides that data.
- The user-controlled data will then be part of an error message that will then be embedded in the output of the HTML template, which is rendered within a `<script>` tag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have some form of control over data that is processed through `MarshalJSON` and used in HTML templates.
- The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerability, how errors from `MarshalJSON` are handled, and how to craft specific error messages containing the injection payload that can bypass escaping within comments.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.21.8 and versions from 1.22.0 before 1.22.1.
- The vulnerability is related to how `html/template` handles errors during template execution, specifically within `<script>` contexts.
- The fix involves escaping additional tokens (`</script>` and `<!--`) in errors returned from `MarshalJSON` when attempting to marshal types in script blocks.
- This vulnerability is tracked as GO-2024-2610 in the Go vulnerability database.
- NetApp products are confirmed to NOT be affected by this vulnerability.
