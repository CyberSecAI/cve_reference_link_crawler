Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an issue in how the `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES` app-op is handled and reset. Specifically, the `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` was incorrectly setting the app-op for every user within the profile group of the 'calling user'.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect App-Op Handling:** The `setInteractAcrossProfilesAppOp` method was setting the app-op based on the calling user's profile group, which is not always reliable when using a server-side internal API where a user ID is explicitly passed.
- **Lack of Proper Resetting:** The `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES` app-op was not being reset correctly, potentially leading to unintended permissions being granted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The CVE description in the Pixel Update Bulletin indicates this is an Information Disclosure vulnerability. The vulnerability could lead to unintended access or modification of information across profiles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is in the `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl`, related to how cross-profile interactions are handled.
- The internal API exposed by `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` to set the `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES` app-op.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the internal API of `CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl` to exploit the vulnerability. This could involve either compromising an application that uses the API or manipulating the user ID being passed to the server-side internal API.
- The attacker may be an app with the ability to interact across profiles.
