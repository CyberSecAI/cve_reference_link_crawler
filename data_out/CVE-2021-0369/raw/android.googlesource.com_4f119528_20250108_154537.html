            Commit Message:
            --------------
            DO NOT MERGE Correctly reset cross-profile app-opDelegate the resetting of the INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES app-op toDevicePolicyManager, which knows whether it should be pre-granted andknows to apply it equally across all users in the profile group.Further unit tests for DevicePolicyManagerInternal will be added inb/175440570 when we have the better infra for that.The CrossProfileAppsServiceImpl changes look more complex than they are.They consist of the following:- Inclusive language changes to 'allowlist'- Static imports of permissions to improve readability- Previously, the setInteractAcrossProfilesAppOp method would set theapp-op for every user within the profile group of the 'calling user'.However, given that we are now exposing this as a server-side internalAPI where we need to pass in a user ID (from AppOpsService), we don'tnecessarily have the guarantee that the 'calling user' is in the sameprofile group. So we split it up: the client-side API and AIDL API stillset the app-op for the calling profile group, whereas the internal APIsets the app-op for every user within the profile group of the provideduser. The changes simply abstract away references to the 'calling userID'.Fixes: 166561076Bug: 175440570Test: atest services/robotests/src/com/android/server/pm/CrossProfileAppsServiceImplRoboTest.java --verbose -cTest: manualChange-Id: I2181fe66022aaf6c3e6d784c0569d2f41ab66537(cherry picked from commit d004f41188ba39afd2c75e4e7dede6b755a9d752)
