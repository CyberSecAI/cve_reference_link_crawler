Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `grafana-plugin-sdk-go` bundles build metadata into the compiled binaries. This metadata includes the repository URI, which is obtained using `git remote get-url origin`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** If the repository URI contains credentials (e.g., in the form of `https://user:password@repo.example.com`), these credentials will be included in the compiled binary. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Attackers who obtain the compiled binary can extract the embedded credentials, which can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the plugin's repository or other resources protected by those credentials.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** With access to the repository, attackers can potentially inject malicious code or modify the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is obtaining the compiled plugin binary. This can happen through various means, such as:
  - Downloading the plugin from a public or private repository.
  - Accessing a system where the plugin is installed.
  - Intercepting network traffic where the plugin binary is transmitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to obtain the compiled binary of a Grafana plugin built using a vulnerable version of the `grafana-plugin-sdk-go`.
- No specific network position is required.
- No specific user-level access is required to perform the attack (as long as the attacker can obtain the binary).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of `grafana-plugin-sdk-go` up to and including `0.249.0`.
- The fix will involve preventing the inclusion of sensitive information in the binary metadata.
