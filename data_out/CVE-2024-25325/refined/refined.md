The provided content relates to CVE-2024-25325.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `login.php` file. Specifically, the code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$email` and `$password`) into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which is enabled by directly inserting user-provided data into the SQL query without sanitization. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, and other information stored.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can potentially bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as another user or an administrator.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface (login form):** The primary attack vector is through the login form located at the `Account/login.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `txtemail` and `txtpassword` fields.
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerable login.php page processes the login via HTTP POST request parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable application and the vulnerable login page.
- **Knowledge of the application's login form:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the login form and the names of the input fields used to submit user credentials.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL payloads.
