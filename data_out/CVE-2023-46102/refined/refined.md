{
  "CVE-2023-46102": {
    "Root cause": "The Android Client application, when enrolled to the AppHub server, connects to an MQTT broker to exchange messages and receive commands. The protocol built on top of MQTT to implement remote management is encrypted with a hard-coded DES symmetric key.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker controlling a malicious MQTT broker on the same subnet can craft and send malicious messages to the HMI device, executing arbitrary commands.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "An attacker must be on the same subnet network as the device.",
        "An attacker must control a malicious MQTT broker."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control a malicious MQTT broker on the same subnet network as the vulnerable device."
  }
