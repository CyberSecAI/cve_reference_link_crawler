images: Add list of Platforms to CheckAuthorization()

```
To be able to properly perform an authorization check on an image we need
to know the platform to perform check when in cryptManifestList(). Extend
the logic for cryptoOp == cryptoOpUnwrapOnly to skip over manifests that
do not correspond to the local platform and return an error if no manifest
was found that matches the local platform.

The following projects seem NOT to be affect due to the change in the code
path of CheckAuthorization() since they are not using it:

- cri-o
- nerdctl
- skopeo
- buildah
- podman

The impact on imgcrypt via ctr-enc is not so clear either since
CheckAuthorization() is not called on the server side but by the ctr-enc
client, thus can be modified easily.

## Package

gomod

github.com/containerd/imgcrypt
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.4

## Patched versions

1.1.4

## Description

Imgcrypt implements a function `CheckAuthorization()` that is supposed to check whether a user is authorized to access an encrypted image given the keys that the user has provided on the command line that would enable decryption of the image. The check is to prevent that a user can start a container from an image that has previously been decrypted by another user on the same system and therefore a decrypted version of the image layers may be already available in the cache locally.

The failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. In the version prior to the fix, only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally (were not pulled) since it cannot be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run lead to other architectures in the ManifestList be able to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. The fixed version now skips over irrelevant architectures and tests the Manifest of the local architecture, if available.

Known projects that use the `CheckAuthorization()` of imgcrypt is for example the ctr-enc client tool provided by imgcrypt. In this implementation, the call to `CheckAuthorization()` is used on the client side and could therefore also be easily circumvented by a modified client tool not calling this function.

In relation to the vulnerability in ctr-enc, affected environments would have to allow different users to invoke ctr-enc indirectly using some sort of management stack that gives user indirect access to ctr-enc.

The patch has been applied to imgcrypt v1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Unauthorized access to encryted container image on a shared system due to missing check in CheckAuthorization() code path

High

[stefanberger](/stefanberger)
published
GHSA-8v99-48m9-c8pm
Mar 25, 2022

## Package

gomod

imgcrypt
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.4

## Patched versions

1.1.4

## Description

### Impact

Imgcrypt implements a function `CheckAuthorization()` that is supposed to check whether a user is authorized to access an encrypted image given the keys that the user has provided on the command line that would enable decryption of the image. The check is to prevent that a user can start a container from an image that has previously been decrypted by another user on the same system and therefore a decrypted version of the image layers may be already available in the cache locally.

The failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. In the version prior to the fix, only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally (were not pulled) since it cannot be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run lead to other architectures in the ManifestList be able to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. The fixed version now skips over irrelevant architectures and tests the Manifest of the local architecture, if available.

Known projects that use the `CheckAuthorization()` of imgcrypt is for example the ctr-enc client tool provided by imgcrypt. In this implementation, the call to `CheckAuthorization()` is used on the client side and could therefore also be easily circumvented by a modified client tool not calling this function.

In relation to the vulnerability in ctr-enc, affected environments would have to allow different users to invoke ctr-enc indirectly using some sort of management stack that gives user indirect access to ctr-enc.

### Patches

The patch has been applied to imgcrypt v1.1.4: [6fdd981](https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/commit/6fdd9818a4d8142107b7ecd767d839c9707700d9)

### Workarounds

Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.

### References

## Description

![@dimitar-dimitrow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82199362?v=4&size=48)[dimitar-dimitrow](https://github.com/dimitar-dimitrow)opened [on Mar 15, 2022](https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/issues/69#issue-1169916522)

When a multi-arch index descriptor is provided to the imgcrypt's CheckAuthorization func (e.g. via image.Target()), the library iterates over the manifests it refers to with the cryptoOpUnwrapOnly option set to true to perform a check only. That causes the cycle to stop on the first manifest in the collection as the condition [here](https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/blob/65d749cef36547473d1c1b0b67ed8a4b9e3d13d4/images/encryption/encryption.go#L384) will always be evaluated to true error-regardless. Additionally, if reading any of the referred [manifest's children returns an errdefs.IsNotFound(err)](https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/blob/65d749cef36547473d1c1b0b67ed8a4b9e3d13d4/images/encryption/encryption.go#L264), the cycle will exit with a nil error, thus, the authorization check passes incorrectly.

Let's take for example the case where the cycle checks the first manifest in the collection (e.g. for amd64) on an arm/arm64 machine, the children of this manifest are not found since this is not the target platform and they are not pulled -> the authorization check passes incorrectly. This issue is rarely reproducible on an amd64 machine as usually, this is the first manifest in the index descriptor.
