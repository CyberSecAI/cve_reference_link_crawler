images: Add list of Platforms to CheckAuthorization()

```
To be able to properly perform an authorization check on an image we need
to know the platform to perform check when in cryptManifestList(). Extend
the logic for cryptoOp == cryptoOpUnwrapOnly to skip over manifests that
do not correspond to the local platform and return an error if no manifest
was found that matches the local platform.

The following projects seem NOT to be affect due to the change in the code
path of CheckAuthorization() since they are not using it:

- cri-o
- nerdctl
- skopeo
- buildah
- podman

The impact on imgcrypt via ctr-enc is not so clear either since
CheckAuthorization() is not called on the server side but by the ctr-enc
client, thus can be modified easily.
