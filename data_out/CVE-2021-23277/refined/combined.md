Vulnerability Details

CVE-2021-23276

CVSS v3 Base Score – 7.1:AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to authenticated SQL injection. A
malicious user can send a specially crafted packet to exploit the vulnerability. Successful exploitation
of this vulnerability can allow  attackers to add users in the data base.

CVE-2021-23277

CVSS v3 Base Score - 8.3: AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection
vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic
evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow
attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker-controlled commands.

CVE-2021-23278

CVSS v3 Base Score – 8.7: AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file delete
vulnerability induced due to improper input validation at server/maps_srv.js with action
removeBackground and server/node_upgrade_srv.js with action removeFirmware. An attacker can
send specially crafted packets to delete the files on the system where IPM software is installed.

CVE-2021-23279

CVSS v3 Base Score – 8.0: AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file
delete vulnerability induced due to improper input validation in meta_driver_srv.js class with
saveDriverData action using invalidated driverID. An attacker can send specially crafted packets to
delete the files on the system where IPM software is installed.

CVE-2021-23280

CVSS v3 Base Score - 8.0: AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file upload
vulnerability. IPM’s maps_srv.js allows an attacker to upload a malicious NodeJS file using
uploadBackgroud action. An attacker can upload a malicious code or execute any command using a
specially crafted packet to exploit the vulnerability.

CVE-2021-23281

CVSS v3 Base Score - 8.3: AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code
execution vulnerability. IPM software does not sanitize the date provided via coverterCheckList action
in meta_driver_srv.js class. Attackers can send a specially crafted packet to make IPM connect to
rouge SNMP server and execute attacker-controlled  code.

recommends blocking ports 4679 & 4680 at the enterprise network or home network where Intelligent
Power Manager (IPM) software is installed and used.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
