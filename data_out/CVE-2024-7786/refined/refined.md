- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control on REST API endpoints within the Sensei LMS WordPress plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to REST API routes allowing disclosure of email templates. Specifically, the `/wp-json/wp/v2/sensei_email` endpoint lists email template IDs, and `/wp-json/wp/v2/sensei_email/<TemplateID>` exposes the content of the templates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of email templates, which may contain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP requests to vulnerable REST API endpoints without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress instance. They do not need to be authenticated.
