The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48824.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `myrs_cleanup` function of the `myrs` SCSI driver. Specifically, if `privdata->hw_init()` fails during `myrs_detect()`, then `cs->disable_intr` remains NULL. When `myrs_cleanup(cs)` is called in such cases it dereferences this null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `myrs_cleanup` function attempts to call `cs->disable_intr(cs)` without checking if `cs->disable_intr` is a valid pointer. This can lead to a kernel crash if `cs->disable_intr` is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The primary impact is a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Hardware initialization failure: The vulnerability is triggered when the hardware initialization in `privdata->hw_init()` fails with a non-zero return value, causing `cs->disable_intr` to remain uninitialized (NULL).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a hardware initialization failure. This can occur in normal operation if the hardware malfunctions, but could also possibly be triggered by manipulating the system in a way that causes this error during device initialization.
