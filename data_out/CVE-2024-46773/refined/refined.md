Based on the provided information, the content relates to the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c` was missing a check for a zero denominator (`pbn_div`) before performing a division operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A division by zero vulnerability exists in the `dm_update_mst_vcpi_slots_for_dsc` function. Specifically, the `DIV_ROUND_UP` macro was used with `pbn_div` as the denominator without checking if `pbn_div` is zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a kernel crash due to a division by zero error, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `dm_update_mst_vcpi_slots_for_dsc` function within the AMD display driver. The exact circumstances to cause `pbn_div` to be zero are not explicitly detailed, but it involves the Multiple Stream Transport (MST) and Display Stream Compression (DSC) configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to control the parameters passed to the display driver related to MST and DSC to force the denominator `pbn_div` to be zero. It is assumed that this would be done via some ioctl or other system call targeting the driver or possibly through a malicious display configuration.

**Additional details:**
- The provided patches address the issue by adding a conditional check for `pbn_div == 0` before the division, skipping the calculation when the denominator is zero.
- This vulnerability was detected and reported by Coverity, a static analysis tool.
- The fix involves adding a simple check, which is a common approach for preventing division-by-zero errors.
