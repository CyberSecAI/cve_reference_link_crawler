# Stored Cross Site Scripting with SVG images

Low

[icemac](/icemac)
published
GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v
Sep 21, 2023

## Package

pip

Zope
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=4.8.9, <=5.8.4

## Patched versions

4.8.10, 5.8.5

## Description

### Impact

There is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images.

Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link.

All versions of Zope are impacted on sites that allow untrusted users to upload images.

### Patches

Patches will be released in Zope 4.8.10 and 5.8.5.

### Workarounds

Make sure the "Add Documents, Images, and Files" permission is only assigned to trusted roles. By default only the Manager has this permission.

### Credits

This was discovered by the [Plone/Zope Security Team](https://plone.org/security/report), after independent initial reports by Gustav Hansen and Faris Krivic. Thanks!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
