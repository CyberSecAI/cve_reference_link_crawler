* Allow only some image types to be displayed inline.

Force download for others, especially SVG images.  By default we use a list of allowed types.
You can switch a to a list of denied types by setting OS environment variable
``OFS_IMAGE_USE_DENYLIST=1``.  This change only affects direct URL access.
``<img src="image.svg" />`` works the same as before.

See security advisory:
[GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v "GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v")

* svg download: only encode filename when it is not bytes.

On Python 2.7 it is already bytes.

* Use guess_extension as first guess for the extension of an image.

* Support overriding ALLOWED_INLINE_MIMETYPES and DISALLOWED_INLINE_MIMETYPES.

* Test that filename of attachment gets encoded correctly.

* Add CVE

|  |  | - Allow only some image types to be displayed inline. Force download for |

|  |  | You can switch a to a list of denied types by setting OS environment variable |
