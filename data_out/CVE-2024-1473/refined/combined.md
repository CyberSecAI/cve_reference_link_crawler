The Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode by Colorlib plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.99 via the REST API.

The only thing missing is the option to indicate excluded pages or IPs.

Facile à installer. J’utilise ce plugging depuis plusieurs années car il est très facile de modifier les templates .php pour obtenir exactement la page dont j’ai besoin.

I’m new to WordPress and all that goes with it. This plugin makes it easy to place a coming soon page as I build my site, which will probably take much longer than it should, but I am learning as I go. Grateful for something so easy for a change.
