The only thing missing is the option to indicate excluded pages or IPs.

Facile à installer. J’utilise ce plugging depuis plusieurs années car il est très facile de modifier les templates .php pour obtenir exactement la page dont j’ai besoin.

I’m new to WordPress and all that goes with it. This plugin makes it easy to place a coming soon page as I build my site, which will probably take much longer than it should, but I am learning as I go. Grateful for something so easy for a change.

Thank you for implementing such functional, yet easy plugin to use. Does what it’s meant to do, and does it well with much complication.
Well appreciated!
