{
  "CVE-2021-47440": {
    "Description": "The `devm_regmap_init` function may return an error, such as due to an out-of-memory condition. When this error is not checked, a null pointer dereference may occur later when reading or writing registers, leading to a general protection fault in the `encx24j600_spi_probe` function.",
    "Root cause": "The `devm_regmap_init` function may return an error, such as due to an out-of-memory condition, which is not checked.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A null pointer dereference leads to a general protection fault, resulting in a denial-of-service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `devm_regmap_init` function fails, which could occur under resource exhaustion conditions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to cause a failure in the devm_regmap_init function such as by exhausting memory resources. This can likely be done locally."
