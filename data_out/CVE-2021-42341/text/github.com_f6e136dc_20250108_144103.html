| It's the `strtok` that's causing a problem with the trailing slash, right?  POSIX actually says that we have to support that:  A pathname that contains at least one non-`<slash>` character and that ends with one or more trailing `<slash>` characters shall not be resolved successfully unless the last pathname component before the trailing `<slash>` characters names an existing directory *or a directory entry that is to be created for a directory immediately after the pathname is resolved*.  (emphasis mine)  Maybe the simplest thing to do is strip any trailing slashes off of the path if `type == inode_dir` and if the path contains at least one non-slash character. |

| Found another corner case:  ``` # mkdir /tmp/foo # cd /tmp/foo # /lib/rc/bin/checkpath --directory /$(pwd)  * //tmp/foo: creating directory # /lib/rc/bin/checkpath --directory /$(pwd) # ls foo # pwd /tmp/foo #   ```  Note how two leading `/` result in `/tmp/foo/foo` being created, despite the argument being just `/tmp/foo` |

| The bugfix for this regression caused an even bigger regression, see <https://bugs.gentoo.org/782808>.  My suggestion:   1. Revert any checkpath changes since (and including commit [b6fef59](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/commit/b6fef599bf8493480664b766040fa9b0d4b1e335), i.e. revert basically all changes to `src/rc/checkpath.c` since 2020+ (see <https://www.gentoofan.org/gentoo/misc/openrc-0.43.2-revert_checkpath_changes.patch>) and release new OpenRC 0.43 without any of these checkpath fixes to not hold back any other improvements. 2. Create a test suite and write tests for checkpath. 3. Resume working on the checkpath fix. 4. Once we have a checkpath which is passing tests, tag a new release with these changes.   PS: I am also wondering why commit [6219d87](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/commit/6219d87071d07acf4d6b3e99ec58134acf129d8e) doesn't show up for 0.43.2 tag but it was included in 0.43.2 release tarball... |
