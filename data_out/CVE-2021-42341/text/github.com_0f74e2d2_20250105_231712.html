### **[garyemiller](/garyemiller)** commented [Oct 8, 2021](#issue-1020593989)

| I am a long time Gentoo user. I run Gentoo stable and unstable on a wide range of machines.  On just one, a Gentoo unstable, running on a znver2 CPU, I get this error:  ``` # /lib/rc/bin/checkpath -d /tmp/tmp free(): invalid pointer Aborted  ```  This has persisted for months. I have done "emerge -e world" many times, with various -mtune, -march, etc. and nothing affects the result.  So I did a "git pull, and looked at src/rc/checkpath.c. Then make this one change:  ``` diff --git a/src/rc/checkpath.c b/src/rc/checkpath.c index bab22692..df93d7d3 100644 --- a/src/rc/checkpath.c +++ b/src/rc/checkpath.c @@ -151,7 +151,8 @@ static char *clean_path(char *path)         char *ch;         char *ch2;         char *str; -       str = xmalloc(strlen(path)); +       str = xmalloc(strlen(path) + 1);         ch = path;         ch2 = str;         while (true) {  ```  The problem goes away. Looks like xmalloc() is just a wrapper on malloc().  According to "man strlen"  ```        The strlen() function calculates the length of the string pointed to by        s, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0').  ```  Looks to me like "str" is not big enough to hold "path" incuding its trailikng '\0'  No idea how that makes "free(path);" fail. But I'm glad it does.  . |
