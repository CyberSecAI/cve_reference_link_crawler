### @thesamesam **[thesamesam](/thesamesam)** commented [Oct 8, 2021](#issue-1020669654)

strlen's return value isn't enough to be used

directly for (x)malloc; it doesn't include

the null byte at the end of the string.

Fixes: [#459](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/issues/459)

Reported-by: Gary E. Miller

X-Gentoo-Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/816900>
