Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly concatenates user-supplied input from the `id` parameter into an SQL query without any sanitization or use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `deactivate_case.php`.
- Lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate the `id` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to:
    - Data manipulation
    - Data exfiltration
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/control/deactivate_case.php` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges needed, any user with network access can attempt the attack
