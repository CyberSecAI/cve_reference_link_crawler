Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Elementor Addons by Livemesh" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the 'slider_style' attribute of the Posts Multislider widget is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `slider_style` attribute, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The plugin doesn't properly neutralize user-provided input before using it to generate web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected page.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).
- **Website Manipulation:** Attackers could deface the website, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected scripts can be used to distribute malware to unsuspecting users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker uses the WordPress admin panel to add or edit a page using the affected plugin and widget.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload for the `slider_style` attribute within the Posts Multislider widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Plugin Access:** The attacker needs access to use and modify the pluginâ€™s widgets.
