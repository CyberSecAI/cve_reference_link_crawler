Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data in the Apache Lucene Replicator module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the deprecated `org.apache.lucene.replicator.http` package.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by unsafe handling of deserialization, which allows an attacker to send crafted data that the application then deserializes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided information doesn't specify the exact impact of exploitation. However, deserialization vulnerabilities can allow arbitrary code execution. Based on other known deserialization vulnerabilities, it could result in remote code execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service (DoS) or information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can send crafted serialized data to a vulnerable instance of Apache Lucene Replicator utilizing the HTTP package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious serialized data suitable for the application.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Lucene Replicator versions 4.4.0 before 9.12.0 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache Lucene Replicator version 9.12.0 or later.
- Java serialization filters (e.g. `-Djdk.serialFilter='!*'`) can be used as a workaround to mitigate the issue on vulnerable versions without impacting functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `org.apache.lucene.replicator.nrt` package is not affected.
- The CVE was found by Summ3r from Vidar-Team.
