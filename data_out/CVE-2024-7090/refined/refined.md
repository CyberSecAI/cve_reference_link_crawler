Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "LH Add Media From Url" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `lh_add_media_from_url-file_url` parameter is not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. User-supplied input in the `lh_add_media_from_url-file_url` parameter is echoed back to the user without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the vulnerable pages. If a user clicks a malicious link, the injected scripts will execute in their browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** Attackers can create a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `lh_add_media_from_url-file_url` parameter. They can then distribute this link via email, social media, or other means, tricking users into clicking it.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered on the plugin's settings page, where the `lh_add_media_from_url-file_url` parameter is used to display the URL in the input field, as observed in the `upload.php` file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attackers:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, as the vulnerable code doesn't require any specific user privileges.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to trick a user into clicking the crafted link. This requires some social engineering effort.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.23.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.30.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Piotr Ku≈õpit
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `partials/upload.php` file, where the value of the `lh_add_media_from_url-file_url` is displayed in the value attribute of the input field without sanitization.

The provided code snippets show the fix in `lh-add-media-from-url.php`, where the `esc_url` function is used to sanitize the input URL before it's used in the upload process (line 83). In `partials/upload.php`, the input field's value is also sanitized using `esc_url()` (line 16), preventing the injection of malicious scripts.
