- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the external authentication password being reflected in the HTML source code of the external authentication profile form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure. The AES encrypted password is included in the HTML source code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can retrieve the external authentication password. This could potentially facilitate other attacks targeting the authenticated admin session, such as XSS, social engineering, or proxy caching attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with authenticated access to the FortiSIEM GUI can view the HTML source of the external authentication profile form to retrieve the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the FortiSIEM GUI.
