Technitium DNS Server is an open source authoritative as well as recursive DNS server that can be used for self hosting a DNS server for privacy & security. It works out-of-the-box with no or minimal configuration and provides a user friendly web console accessible using any modern web browser.

Nobody really bothers about domain name resolution since it works automatically behind the scenes and is complex to understand. Most computer software use the operating system's DNS resolver that usually query the configured ISP's DNS server using UDP protocol. This way works well for most people but, your ISP can see and control what website you can visit even when the website employ HTTPS security. Not only that, some ISPs can redirect, block or inject content into websites you visit even when you use a different DNS provider like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS. Having Technitium DNS Server configured to use [DNS-over-TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS), [DNS-over-HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS), or [DNS-over-QUIC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9250.html) encrypted DNS protocols with forwarders, these privacy & security issues can be mitigated very effectively.

Be it a home network or an organization's network, having a locally running DNS server gives you more insights into your network and helps to understand it better using the DNS logs and stats. It improves overall performance since most queries are served from the DNS cache making web sites load faster by not having to wait for frequent DNS resolutions. It also gives you an additional control over your network allowing you to block domain names network wide and also allows you to route your DNS traffic securely using encrypted DNS protocols.

### Block Ads At DNS Level

Technitium DNS Server allows you to configure Block List URLs that gets automatically updated daily to block ads on your network. The Quick Add option lists popular block lists available for you to choose from.

### Privacy & Security

Technitium DNS Server supports using DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNS-over-QUIC protocols for forwarders allowing you to use popular public DNS resolvers like Cloudflare, Google & Quad9. These protocols provides privacy by encrypting your DNS traffic on the network and protects you from man-in-the-middle attacks.

### How To Get Started

1. Download and install the DNS server. You can use the portable zip/tar.gz file too by extracting and run the DNS Server app.
2. Open <http://localhost:5380/> on your favourite web browser.
3. The web console will auto login using default username 'admin' and password 'admin'. Don't forget to change the password to disable auto login!
4. Optionally, configure forwarder DNS server IP addresses or URLs in DNS Settings so that the DNS Server uses them to resolve requests instead of doing recursive resolution by itself. You may configure any public DNS server like Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS or OpenDNS.
5. Configure the DNS server's IP address in your network configuration and on other computers on the network if needed. You can use the built-in DHCP server to assign IP addresses and the DNS servers automatically on your local network.
6. ???
7. Profit!

### API Documentation

The DNS server HTTP API allows any 3rd party app or script to configure the DNS server. The HTTP API is used by the web console and thus all the actions that the web console does can be performed via the API. Read the [HTTP API documentation](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/blob/master/APIDOCS.md) for complete details.

|  | > An issue that supports a default response packet size of more than 4,096 bytes was discovered in Technitium through 11.0.2. |
|  | > It enables attackers to launch |
|  | > amplification attacks (3 times more than other "golden model" software |
|  | > like BIND) and cause potential DoS. |

|  | CVE-2023-49203 |
|  | > [Suggested description] |
|  | > Technitium 11.5.3 |
|  | > allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bandwidth |
|  | > amplification) because the DNSBomb manipulation causes accumulation of |
|  | > low-rate DNS queries such that there is a large-sized response in a |
|  | > burst of traffic. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > Technitium is an individual vendor. |
|  | > |
|  | > We found a new DNS vulnerability that can be exploited to perform a new |
|  | > pulsing DoS attack, named the DNSBomb attack. DNSBomb exploits multiple |
|  | > widely-implemented DNS mechanisms to accumulate DNS queries that are |
|  | > sent at a low rate, amplify queries into large-sized responses, and |
|  | > concentrate all DNS responses into a short, high-volume periodic |
|  | > pulsing burst to simultaneously overwhelm target systems. The effects |
|  | > of an exploit would be widespread and highly impactful, as our |
|  | > small-scale experiments show that the peak pulse magnitude can approach |
|  | > 8.7Gb/s and the bandwidth amplification factor can exceed 20,000x. |
|  | > Besides, DNSBomb conforms to defacto DNS specifications and best |
|  | > practices and exploits current mitigation patches of "birthday |
|  | > paradox"-based DNS cache poisoning attacks. |
