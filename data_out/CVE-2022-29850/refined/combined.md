# Lexmark Security Advisories

## Security advisories for Lexmark devices

Lexmarkâs ultimate goal is to produce software and hardware that is free from security-related vulnerabilities, however, the sheer complexity of the code in the products results in the need to be able to address security-related issues in released products. Lexmarkâs software and hardware products contain hundreds of files, thousands of objects, and tens of millions of lines of code and a product that was released with no known vulnerabilities may indeed have new vulnerabilities identified over time. This can be due to a previously unidentified vulnerability found in custom code written by Lexmark, in a common shared system library, or in a third-party library integrated into the Lexmark software or firmware. Lexmarkâs security staff and experts monitor multiple channels for the identification of new security vulnerabilities including: internal review, customer service, security-focused press, security-related academic research, and technical alerts from organizations like NIST-National Vulnerability Database and US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, Lexmark uses scanning tools during the implementation phase that scan source code for out-of-date or vulnerable shared libraries.

Registration

Sign up [here](https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/GlobalPreferenceCenter.html "here") for the latest security alerts.

Identification Process

When new vulnerabilities are identified which might affect Lexmarkâs products, they are addressed via the following process:

1. The vulnerability is analyzed to determine if it affects the product. (Vulnerabilities found in shared system or third-party code libraries may not apply, depending on the way the code is used in the system).

2. Lexmarkâs security staff determines if the exploit mechanism for the vulnerability is possible in Lexmarkâs implementation.

3. If yes, then the security bug is scored using industry standard Common Vulnerability Scoring Systems (CVSS). Note: The severity score published in a technical alert may score differently in specific implementations.

4. Internal processes are initiated to log, track, patch, and test the bug fix, and updated code is provided via a patch process.

5. If the CVSS score warrants, Lexmark will issue a security advisory for the products affected.

Additional details can be found in our Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) [Whitepaper](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/white-paper/y2024/NA-SSDL-Overview_082224.pdf "Whitepaper").

Submitting an issue

For product security vulnerabilities affecting Lexmark printers, send an e-mail to securityalerts@lexmark.com.

You may use Lexmark's PGP key to encrypt sensitive information (Click [here](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/filedownloads/y2023/Lexmark-PGP-Public-Key.pem "here") to download our PGP public key).   Please also include your PGP key so we may communicate with you on sensitive issues.

# Lexmark Security Advisories

## Security advisories for Lexmark devices

Lexmarkâs ultimate goal is to produce software and hardware that is free from security-related vulnerabilities, however, the sheer complexity of the code in the products results in the need to be able to address security-related issues in released products. Lexmarkâs software and hardware products contain hundreds of files, thousands of objects, and tens of millions of lines of code and a product that was released with no known vulnerabilities may indeed have new vulnerabilities identified over time. This can be due to a previously unidentified vulnerability found in custom code written by Lexmark, in a common shared system library, or in a third-party library integrated into the Lexmark software or firmware. Lexmarkâs security staff and experts monitor multiple channels for the identification of new security vulnerabilities including: internal review, customer service, security-focused press, security-related academic research, and technical alerts from organizations like NIST-National Vulnerability Database and US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, Lexmark uses scanning tools during the implementation phase that scan source code for out-of-date or vulnerable shared libraries.

Registration

Sign up [here](https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/GlobalPreferenceCenter.html "here") for the latest security alerts.

Identification Process

When new vulnerabilities are identified which might affect Lexmarkâs products, they are addressed via the following process:

1. The vulnerability is analyzed to determine if it affects the product. (Vulnerabilities found in shared system or third-party code libraries may not apply, depending on the way the code is used in the system).

2. Lexmarkâs security staff determines if the exploit mechanism for the vulnerability is possible in Lexmarkâs implementation.

3. If yes, then the security bug is scored using industry standard Common Vulnerability Scoring Systems (CVSS). Note: The severity score published in a technical alert may score differently in specific implementations.

4. Internal processes are initiated to log, track, patch, and test the bug fix, and updated code is provided via a patch process.

5. If the CVSS score warrants, Lexmark will issue a security advisory for the products affected.

Additional details can be found in our Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) [Whitepaper](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/white-paper/y2024/NA-SSDL-Overview_082224.pdf "Whitepaper").

Submitting an issue

For product security vulnerabilities affecting Lexmark printers, send an e-mail to securityalerts@lexmark.com.

You may use Lexmark's PGP key to encrypt sensitive information (Click [here](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/filedownloads/y2023/Lexmark-PGP-Public-Key.pem "here") to download our PGP public key).   Please also include your PGP key so we may communicate with you on sensitive issues.

Lexmark Security Advisory:

1.1
Revision:
Last update:
22 June 2022
Public Release Date:  30 June 2022

Summary
This vulnerability allows an attacker who has already compromised an affected Lexmark device to maintain
persistence across reboots.

References
CVE:     CVE-2022-29850

CWE:     CWE-15,  CWE-20

Details
Lexmark firmware is stored in a compressed read-only filesystem that is continuously integrity checked as
programs are loaded into RAM for execution.  This means that if a device is somehow compromised, a reboot
should clear the issue from the device.

This vulnerability allows an attacker that has already compromised the device, and therefore has the ability to
modify internal configuration files, to make their compromise persistent, meaning after a device is rebooted, it
will remain compromised.

NOTE: This vulnerability cannot be used to compromise a device, it can only be used on a device that has
already been compromised by another means.

CVSSv3 scores are calculated in accordance with CVSS version 3.1   (https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)

Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to persistent backdoor installed on the affected device.

Affected Products
To determine a devices firmware level, select the “Settings”->“Reports”->”Menu Setting Page” menu item
from the operator panel.  If the firmware level listed under “Device Information” matches any level under
“Affected Releases”, then upgrade to a “Fixed Release”.
