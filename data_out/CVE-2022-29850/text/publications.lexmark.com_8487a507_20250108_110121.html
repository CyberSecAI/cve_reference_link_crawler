Lexmark Security Advisory:

1.1
Revision:
Last update:
22 June 2022
Public Release Date:  30 June 2022

Summary
This vulnerability allows an attacker who has already compromised an affected Lexmark device to maintain
persistence across reboots.

References
CVE:     CVE-2022-29850

CWE:     CWE-15,  CWE-20

Details
Lexmark firmware is stored in a compressed read-only filesystem that is continuously integrity checked as
programs are loaded into RAM for execution.  This means that if a device is somehow compromised, a reboot
should clear the issue from the device.

This vulnerability allows an attacker that has already compromised the device, and therefore has the ability to
modify internal configuration files, to make their compromise persistent, meaning after a device is rebooted, it
will remain compromised.

NOTE: This vulnerability cannot be used to compromise a device, it can only be used on a device that has
already been compromised by another means.

CVSSv3 scores are calculated in accordance with CVSS version 3.1   (https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)

Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to persistent backdoor installed on the affected device.

Affected Products
To determine a devices firmware level, select the “Settings”->“Reports”->”Menu Setting Page” menu item
from the operator panel.  If the firmware level listed under “Device Information” matches any level under
“Affected Releases”, then upgrade to a “Fixed Release”.
