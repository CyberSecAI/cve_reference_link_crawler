Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-29976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper privilege management in the `/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/show_allsessions` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure of sensitive session data, including administrator session tokens.
- Lack of proper authorization checks for the `show_allsessions` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated low-privileged attacker can gain administrator access by obtaining a valid admin session token.
- This allows the attacker to bypass authentication and perform administrative tasks, potentially leading to full device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a GET request to the `/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/show_allsessions` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires the attacker to have a valid low-privileged user account on the affected device.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Zyxel NAS326 and NAS542 devices.
- The `show_allsessions` command reveals MAC addresses of interfaces and session tokens of all authenticated users.
- This information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to further compromise the device.
