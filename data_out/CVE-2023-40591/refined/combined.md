# DoS via malicious p2p message

High

[holiman](/holiman)
published
GHSA-ppjg-v974-84cm
Sep 6, 2023

## Package

gomod

go-ethereum
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.10.0

## Patched versions

1.12.1

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerable node, can be made to consume unbounded amounts of memory when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node.

### Details

The p2p handler spawned a new goroutine to respond to `ping` requests. By flooding a node with ping requests, an unbounded number of goroutines can be created, leading to resource exhaustion and potentially crash due to OOM.

### Patches

The fix is included in geth version `1.12.1-stable`, i.e, `1.12.2-unstable` and onwards.

Fixed by [#27887](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27887)

### Workarounds

No known workarounds.

### Credits

This bug was reported by Patrick McHardy and reported via bounty@ethereum.org.

### References

### Severity

[v1.12.1](/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/v1.12.1)

[`9c216bd`](/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/9c216bd6cbd7f0d3ab179700907a53409beeca9b)

Geth v1.12.1 is a maintenance release, albeit a rather large one, since we haven't put out a version since May.

This release is a recommended upgrade for all users and contains security-related fixes.

Here's the list of changes:

#### Cancun fork

Development for the upcoming Cancun hard fork has been a focus in this release cycle. Do note however, that Geth v1.12.1 is **not yet ready** for Cancun.

* For EIP-4844 'Shard Blob Transactions', this release contains basic type definitions and state transition logic ([#27356](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27356), [#27382](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27382), [#27392](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27392), [#27393](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27393), [#27470](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27470), [#27721](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27721), [#27736](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27736), [#27743](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27743), [#27767](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27767), [#27789](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27789), [#27791](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27791), [#27793](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27793), [#27796](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27796), [#27797](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27797), [#27825](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27825), [#27874](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27874))
* We have also implemented an entirely new mempool -- the blobpool -- for EIP-4844 transactions. The new pool is backed by an on-disk database and has an overall simpler design than the txpool we use for regular transactions. The blobpool is not yet used by p2p networking and is still being tested in the Cancun devnets. ([#26940](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26940), [#27429](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27429), [#27463](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27463), [#27481](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27481), [#27790](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27790), [#27822](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27822))
* EIP-6780: 'SELFDESTRUCT only in same transaction' ([#27189](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27189))
* EIP-5656: 'MCOPY instruction' ([#26181](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26181))
* EIP-1153: 'Transient storage opcodes' was already implemented and is enabled for Cancun ([#27663](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27663), [#27613](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27613))

#### Geth command changes

* The Rinkeby testnet is no longer supported in Geth ([#27406](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27406))
* `geth --dev` now simulates a PoS-based chain ([#27327](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27327))
* `evm blocktest` can now output structured logs ([#27396](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27396))
* Geth will now configure GOMAXPROCS based on CPU quota settings. This should improve efficiency when running in Docker containers with a CPU core limit applied. ([#27506](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27506), [#27814](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27814))
* An IPv6 listening address for can now be configured for HTTP/WS ([#27628](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27628)) ([#27635](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27635))

#### RPC/GraphQL API changes

* JSON transactions now have a `yParity` fields, as mandated by the RPC API spec ([#27744](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27744), [#27882](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27882))
* Legacy transactions now have a `chainID` field in RPC responses, like all other transaction types ([#27452](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27452))
* Block headers returned by RPC no longer report a non-standard `size` field ([#27347](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27347))
* `eth_estimateGas` now supports state overrides like `eth_call` ([#27845](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27845))
* `eth_estimateGas` now handles internal chain reorgs more correctly ([#27505](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27505))
* `eth_getProof` is slight more efficient, and will now return a response in the canonical encoding even for off-spec input parameters ([#27309](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27309), [#27310](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27310))
* `eth_getTransactionReceipt` now returns `null` when the transaction is not available. It used return an error in that case. ([#27712](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27712))
* `debug_storageRangeAt` now takes a block hash or number as parameter ([#27328](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27328))
* The new `debug_getTrieFlushInterval` method reports the internal state saving interval ([#27303](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27303))
* A crash in the prestate tracer is resolved ([#27691](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27691))
* Structured EVM logs returned by tracing now contain the `returnData` ([#27704](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27704))
* GraphQL now supports withdrawals (EIP-4895) ([#27072](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27072))

#### Go library changes

* The RPC server now enforces limits on batch requests and responses. This is a potentially breaking change.

  If you use batch requests with geth, and also use the go-ethereum RPC client library, **we strongly recommend updating your go-ethereum library dependency** as well. The new client version handles invalid batch responses way better than before. ([#26681](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26681))
* The RPC client has multiple new ways to test whether the transport supports real time subscriptions ([#25942](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25942))
* fsync is now enabled for pebble database writes ([#27615](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27615), [#27522](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27522))
* Function calls timed by metrics will now run even if metrics are disabled ([#27724](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27724), [#27723](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27723))
* `Node.Attach` no longer returns an error. This is a breaking Go API change. ([#27450](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27450))
* The keystore has improved verification of keys loaded from disk ([#27432](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27432))
* Per-level metrics are now available for LevelDB ([#27643](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27643))

#### Core

* All block creation activity is now paused while the node is syncing ([#27218](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27218))
* Two minor bugs in the transaction pool are resolved in this release ([#27404](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27404), [#27479](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27479))
* Geth no longer uses a 'clean cache file' to persist internal caches across restarts. While persistent cache added a small performance boost right after startup, it could cause obscure issues in certain restart scenarios. ([#27525](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27525))
* A large portion of the new Path-Based State Storage scheme has been implemented. While it isn't active yet, we are planning to make this new storage method available in the next release. ([#25963](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25963), [#27323](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27323), [#27349](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27349), [#27428](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27428), [#27687](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27687), [#27753](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27753), [#27815](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27815))
* As part of testing the new storage scheme, some inconsistencies in selfdestruct handling were discovered by fuzz tests and had to be fixed ([#27376](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27376), [#27339](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27339))
* We have also made significant progress on the integration of Verkle Trees, which required changes to internal state-handling APIs ([#27000](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27000), [#27209](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27209), [#27464](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27464), [#27476](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27476), [#27544](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27544), [#27853](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27853))

#### Networking

* A serious memory leak related to database writes in snap sync is fixed in this release ([#27842](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27842))
* Large transactions (> 4kB) are no longer broadcasted to peers. This resolves a potential network congestion issue ([#27618](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27618))
* The p2p networking layer has learned to announce alternate ports returned by UPnP/NAT-PMP ([#26359](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26359))
* The p2p server now properly tracks all peer goroutines ([#27887](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27887))
* Networking initialization now really disables all discovery when `--nodiscover` is used ([#27518](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27518))
* Obsolete parts of the LES protocol implementation, which is currently non-functional, have been removed ([#27737](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27737))
* Discovery bootstrap nodes will now be filtered by the netrestrict setting, like all other nodes ([#27701](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27701))
* We now provide additional metrics around p2p dialing, making it possible to measure the efficieny of peer discovery ([#27621](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27621))
* The downloader no longer accumulates goroutines/memory while processing reorgs ([#27397](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27397))
* A very rare crash related to peer connection tracking is resolved ([#27665](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27665))
* It is now possible to configure certain discovery internals for experimentation ([#27387](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27387))

#### Build

# Vulnerability disclosure

Last edited on August 14, 2023

In the software world, it is expected for security vulnerabilities to be immediately announced, thus giving operators an opportunity to take protective measure against attackers.

Vulnerabilities typically take two forms:

1. Vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would harm the software operator. In the case of Geth, examples would be:
   * A bug that would allow remote reading or writing of OS files, or
   * Remote command execution, or
   * Bugs that would leak cryptographic keys
2. Vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would harm the Ethereum mainnet. In the case of Geth, examples would be:
   * Consensus vulnerabilities, which would cause a chain split,
   * Denial-of-service during block processing, whereby a malicious transaction could cause the geth-portion of the network to crash.
   * Denial-of-service via p2p networking, whereby portions of the network could be made
     inaccessible due to crashes or resource consumption.

In most cases so far, vulnerabilities in Geth have been of the second type, where the health of the network is a concern, rather than individual node operators. For such issues, Geth reserves the right to silently patch and ship fixes in new releases.

### Why silent patches

In the case of Ethereum, it takes a lot of time (weeks, months) to get node operators to update even to a scheduled hard fork. If we were to highlight that a release contains important consensus or DoS fixes, there is always a risk of someone trying to beat node operators to the punch, and exploit the vulnerability. Delaying a potential attack sufficiently to make the majority of node operators immune may be worth the temporary loss of transparency.

The primary goal for the Geth team is the health of the Ethereum network as a whole, and the decision whether or not to publish details about a serious vulnerability boils down to minimizing the risk and/or impact of discovery and exploitation.

At certain times, it's better to remain silent. This practice is also followed by other projects such as [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html), [ZCash](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) and [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret).

### Public transparency

As of November 2020, our policy going forward is:

* If we silently fix a vulnerability and include the fix in release X, then,
* After 4-8 weeks, we will disclose that X contained a security-fix.
* After an additional 4-8 weeks, we will publish the details about the vulnerability.

We hope that this provides sufficient balance between transparency versus the need for secrecy, and aids node operators and downstream projects in keeping up to date with what versions to run on their infrastructure.

In keeping with this policy, we have taken inspiration from [Solidity bug disclosure](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/bugs.html) - see below.

## Disclosed vulnerabilities

There is a JSON-formatted list ([vulnerabilities.json](/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities.json)) of some of the known security-relevant vulnerabilities concerning Geth.

As of version 1.9.25, Geth has a built-in command to check whether it is affected by any publicly disclosed vulnerability, using the command geth version-check. This command will fetch the latest json file (and the accompanying [signature-file](/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities.json.minisig), and cross-check the data against its own version number.

The list of vulnerabilities was started in November 2020, and covers mainly v1.9.7 and forward.

The JSON file of known vulnerabilities below is a list of objects, one for each vulnerability, with the following keys:

* name
  + Unique name given to the vulnerability.
* uid
  + Unique identifier of the vulnerability. Format GETH-<year>-<sequential id>
* summary
  + Short description of the vulnerability.
* description
  + Detailed description of the vulnerability.
* links
  + List of relevant URLs with more detailed information (optional).
* introduced
  + The first published Geth version that contained the vulnerability (optional).
* fixed
  + The first published Geth version that did not contain the vulnerability anymore.
* published
  + The date at which the vulnerability became known publicly (optional).
* severity
  + Severity of the vulnerability: low, medium, high, critical.
  + Takes into account the severity of impact and likelihood of exploitation.
* check
  + This field contains a regular expression, which can be used against the reported web3\_clientVersion of a node. If the check
    matches, the node is with a high likelihood affected by the vulnerability.
* CVE
  + The assigned CVE identifier, if available (optional)
### What about GitHub security advisories

We prefer to not rely on GitHub as the only/primary publishing protocol for security advisories, but we plan to use the GitHub-advisory process as a second channel for disseminating vulnerability-information.

Advisories published via GitHub can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories?state=published).

## Bug Bounties

The Ethereum Foundation run a bug bounty program to reward responsible disclosures of bugs in client software and specs. The details are provided on [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty/).
