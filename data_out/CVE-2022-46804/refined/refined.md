The provided content relates to CVE-2022-46804.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input when exporting data to a CSV file. This allows for the injection of malicious formulas into the CSV.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection. The plugin doesn't sanitize the exported data, which leads to formula injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to craft malicious formulas that, when opened in spreadsheet software, could lead to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine, or potentially other malicious actions depending on the capabilities of the spreadsheet software.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the exported CSV file generated by the vulnerable plugin. An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber) can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (or have other user privileges sufficient to trigger the export function) to trigger the export of the crafted CSV.
