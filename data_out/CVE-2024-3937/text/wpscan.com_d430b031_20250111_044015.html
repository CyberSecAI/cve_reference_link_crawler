## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Playlist for Youtube <= 1.32 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=playlists\_yt\_free
2. For the Playlist Name and/or Video size add the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Click "Add" and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
