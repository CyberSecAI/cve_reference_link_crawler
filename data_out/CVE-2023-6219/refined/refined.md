Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6219

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient file validation in the `bookingpress_process_upload` function within the BookingPress plugin. The plugin does not properly validate file types during upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of arbitrary files, bypassing necessary security checks on the file's content and type.
- **Inadequate File Extension Filtering:**  The code checks for a list of invalid extensions, but it does not enforce a whitelist of allowed extensions, and does not correctly check file types, which allows for bypassing security checks by using a valid extension with a malicious payload.
- **Missing proper file content verification**: While the code attempts to block files containing `<?php` it does not block other variations like `<?=` or other similar PHP short tags that can be used to execute code

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any file type to the server.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious PHP files, attackers can achieve remote code execution, compromising the entire WordPress site and potentially the server it's hosted on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface.
- **File Upload Function:** The vulnerability is located in the file upload functionality of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have higher-level privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Access to vulnerable upload functionality:** The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin's functionality that uses the `bookingpress_process_upload` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in BookingPress versions up to and including 1.0.76.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.77 with changes in `class.bookingpress_fileupload_class.php` to address the insufficient file validation by adding `<?=` to the check and with changes in `class.bookingpress_settings.php` to perform nonce and capability checks, as well as adding a check to make sure that only image files are uploaded when used for company avatars.
- The patch also introduces a more strict approach to file uploads within the settings page, such as nonce validation, capability check, and limiting the file types to images only.
