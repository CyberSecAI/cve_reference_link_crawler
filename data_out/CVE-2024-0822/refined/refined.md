Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `CreateUserSessionCommand` in ovirt-engine, which could be directly invoked through the `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/GenericApiGWTService` endpoint. The `isUserAuthorizedToRunAction` method within this command was incorrectly set to always return `true`, meaning that the action could be invoked without prior authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is a missing authentication check before executing the `CreateUserSessionCommand`.
- **Unrestricted Access:** The `isUserAuthorizedToRunAction` method always returns true, effectively allowing anyone to call the command.
- **User Creation Vulnerability:** When the `ENGINE_SSO_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SSO` option is disabled, the system attempts to create a new user if a specified user does not exist. This creation does not assign any group membership or rights, thus failing because of a missing Login right but still attempting to modify user table with null username.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized User Creation:** Attackers could potentially create new user accounts within the ovirt-engine system, even without valid credentials if `ENGINE_SSO_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SSO` is disabled. Although the user creation fails due to missing rights, this is an unwanted side effect that shows that authentication was bypassed.
- **Potential Session Hijacking (with additional knowledge):** If `ENGINE_SSO_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SSO` is enabled,  an attacker with knowledge of an existing user's username or external ID could obtain a valid session for that user without valid authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Call:** The attack vector involves directly calling the `CreateUserSessionCommand` through the `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/GenericApiGWTService` endpoint. The service exposes the `runAction` method to call the command.
- **GWT-RPC:** The endpoint uses GWT-RPC, making the payload somewhat obfuscated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the `/ovirt-engine/webadmin/GenericApiGWTService` endpoint of the vulnerable ovirt-engine instance.
- **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the GWT-RPC API, specifically how to invoke the `CreateUserSessionCommand`.
- **(Conditional) User Information:** If the `ENGINE_SSO_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SSO` configuration is enabled, the attacker needs to know the username (if external SSO is enabled) or the external ID of a user to obtain a valid session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found during an internal penetration test.
- The fix involves disabling execution of the `CreateUserSession` command from GWT code.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Virtualization Engine 4.4 via RHSA-2024:0934.
- A patch has been developed which disables execution of CreateUserSession from GWT code.
