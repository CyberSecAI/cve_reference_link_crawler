- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetQosBand` function of the Tenda AC10U router firmware due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The `list` parameter from a POST request is directly used in `strcpy` without length verification.
    - The `qos_str` buffer has a fixed size of 256 bytes.
    - Uncontrolled user input can overflow the fixed-size buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service on the affected device.
    - The stack overflow allows overwriting return addresses or other critical data, leading to control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Attacker sends a POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint with a `list` parameter containing a payload larger than 256 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
    - The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.
    - The device needs to be accessible to the attacker, typically through the network.
