Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ajax.php` file of the SourceCodester Simple Library Management System. Specifically, line 23 of the file directly uses the input obtained from `$_FILES` to determine the storage location of the uploaded file, without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The lack of input validation and sanitization on the file upload mechanism allows attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files on the server.
*   **File Injection:** Malicious files, such as PHP scripts, can be injected into the server.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers might be able to use directory traversal techniques to place files outside of the intended upload directory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large files can potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a file upload feature in the `ajax.php` file. Specifically, the `img` parameter within the multipart form data is used to upload the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request to `/ajax.php?action=save_book` with a multipart form data payload.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the form data, specifically the name of the file upload parameter `img`, to inject malicious files.
*  The attacker can be remote.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `ajax.php` line 23.
*   The content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) using a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious PHP script uploaded as the `img` parameter. The PoC demonstrates the successful execution of the uploaded PHP script.
