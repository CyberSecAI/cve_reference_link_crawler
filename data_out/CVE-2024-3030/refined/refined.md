Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Announce from the Dashboard" WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied data, such as announcement titles and content, were not properly sanitized before being stored in the database and displayed on the dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to Stored XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs, which allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts into the database. When these announcements were displayed, the injected scripts would execute in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute whenever a user views the affected page. This could lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    - **Data theft:** Extracting sensitive data from the WordPress site or user's browser.
    - **Website defacement:** Modifying website content for malicious purposes.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
    - **Privilege escalation:** Exploiting the vulnerability to gain higher privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Interface:** The attack vector involves exploiting the plugin's admin settings where announcements are created and edited.
- **Injected Data:** Malicious scripts are injected through the title or content fields of the announcement forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** Attackers must be authenticated with administrator-level permissions or higher to access the plugin's settings and create or edit announcements.
- **Access to plugin settings:** Attackers need access to the plugin's admin interface to create malicious announcements.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is only exploitable on multi-site installations or when `unfiltered_html` is disabled, which means the WordPress installation needs to be specifically configured for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- The fix implemented in version 1.5.3 includes:
    - Using `sanitize_text_field` for announcement titles, types, roles, start/end dates, and standard fields.
    - Using `wp_kses_post` to sanitize the announcement content, which allows for a safe subset of HTML tags.
    - Using `stripslashes` to remove slashes that might be added by WordPress escaping functions, along with `esc_html` to encode HTML entities.

This vulnerability could be exploited to perform privilege escalation and steal sensitive data from the website and user's browsers.
