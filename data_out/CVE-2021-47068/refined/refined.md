{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the NFC subsystem due to a race condition when the same local is assigned to two different sockets. When a socket is bound or connected to an NFC device, a reference to the device's local is stored in the socket structure. If the socket is closed or unbound, the reference counter of the local is decremented. However, the reference to the local is not set to NULL, if another socket is bound or connected to the same local it will have a stale pointer to the local which leads to a use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"

    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability, potentially leading to a crash, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by binding the same local to two different sockets via the NFC subsystem.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create NFC sockets and bind them to the same local NFC device"
