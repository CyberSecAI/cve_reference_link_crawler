|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 9.0.1 - 2024-mm-dd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
|  |  | - Ensure that when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., |
|  |  | it is delegated directly from the root capability, that `expires` |
|  |  | is properly checked against the current date or other `date` param. |

# Incomplete expiration checks in capability chains.

Moderate

published
GHSA-hp8h-7x69-4wmv
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

npm

@digitalbazaar/zcap
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 9.0.1

## Patched versions

9.0.1

## Description

### Impact

When invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param. This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period. A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material.

### Patches

`@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking.

### Workarounds

A zcap could be revoked at any time.

### References

[#82](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/pull/82)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
