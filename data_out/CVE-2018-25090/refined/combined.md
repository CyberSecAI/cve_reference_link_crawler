[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2023-039/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2023-039: Wago%3A%20Multiple%20vulnerabilities%20in%20web-based%20management%20of%20multiple%20products)

#### ID

VDE-2023-039

#### Published

2024-03-13 09:30 (CET)

#### Last update

2024-03-13 09:31 (CET)

#### Vendor(s)

WAGO GmbH & Co. KG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 750-831/xxx-xxx | Controller BACnet/IP | <= FW13 |
| 750-829 | Controller BACnet MS/TP | <= FW13 |
| 750-88x/xxx-xxx | Ethernet Controller 3rd Generation | <= FW13 |
| 750-852 | Ethernet Controller 3rd Generation | <= FW13 |
| 750-352/xxx-xxx | Fieldbus Coupler Ethernet 3rd Generation | <= FW13 |

#### Summary

The Web-Based Management (WBM) of WAGOs programmable logic controller (PLC) is typically used for administration, commissioning, and updates.

The option to change the configuration data via tools or the web-based-management enabled attackers to prepare cross-site-scripting attacks and under specific circumstances perform remote code execution.

#### Vulnerabilities

[**CVE-2015-10123**](#cvedetails-CVE-2015-10123)

7.5

**Last Update**
Aug. 30, 2024, 9:13 a.m.

**Severity**
7.5

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')[(CWE-120)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)

**Summary**
*An unautheticated remote attacker could send specifically crafted packets to a affected device. If an authenticated user then views that data in a specific page of the web-based management a buffer overflow will be triggered to gain full access of the device.*

**Details**

[**CVE-2018-25090**](#cvedetails-CVE-2018-25090)

6.1

**Last Update**
Aug. 30, 2024, 9:25 a.m.

**Severity**
6.1

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')[(CWE-79)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Summary**
*The configuration data page of the web-based-management of affected devices has been vulnerable to stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This leads to a limited impact of confidentiality and integrity but no impact of availability.*

**Details**
[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2018-25090)

#### Impact

The web-based management of affected products is vulnerable to Reflective Cross-Site Scripting. This can be used to install malicious code and to gain access to confidential information on a System that connects to the WBM after it has been compromised.

Additionally, the affected products contain a buffer overflow vulnerability which enables attackers to remotely execute code, which could lead to compromise of data and execution of malicious code.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

If not needed, you can deactivate the web-based management to prevent attacks (command line). Disable
unused TCP/UDP-ports. Restrict network access to the device. Do not directly connect the device to the
internet.

**Remediation**

A fix for the affected firmwares will be provided with the following firmware versions:

* > FW13 installed on 750-352/xxx-xxx
* > FW13 installed on 750-88x/xxx-xxx
* > FW13 installed on 750-852

No fix planned for products:

* <= FW13 installed on 750-831/xxx-xxx
* <= FW13 installed on 750-829

#### Reported by

The vulnerability was reported by Connor Ford from Nettitude.

Coordination done by CERT@VDE.
