Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1126

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `get_attendees_email_by_event_id()` function of the EventPrime plugin. This function lacks proper verification of user capabilities before retrieving and exposing attendee lists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. The `get_attendees_email_by_event_id()` function does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the attendee list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve the email addresses of attendees for any event, even if they are not authorized to view this information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via an authenticated request to the vulnerable function `get_attendees_email_by_event_id()`.
- The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress site with at least subscriber level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site (at least subscriber level) to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make network requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in EventPrime plugin versions up to and including 3.4.2
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4.3 by implementing proper capability checks in the `get_attendees_email_by_event_id()` function which now requires 'manage_options' or 'edit_posts' capabilities.
- The provided patch also includes a nonce check for 'ep_email_attendies' in the same function.
- The fix also introduces a permission check before exporting all bookings.
