## Analysis of CVE-2023-1108

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an infinite loop in the `SslConduit` of the Undertow web server during the closing of an SSL connection. This occurs due to an unexpected handshake status update where the loop never terminates. A specific change introduced in newer JDKs (specifically mentioned are jdk 11.0.18, and may be jdk 17.0.6) leads to this behavior by updating status to closed but requiring a wrap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is an infinite loop in the SslConduit during a close operation when there is a NEED_WRAP handshake status but the status is updated to closed, which does not terminate the loop.
*   **Handshake Status Update:** The incorrect handling of the handshake status during closing is the direct cause, which is triggered by a change in how recent JDKs update the SSL status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service condition. The infinite loop consumes server resources, rendering the affected service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network. An attacker can trigger the loop through an HTTPS connection by sending a specially crafted request that triggers the vulnerable close operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected server or service.
*   **HTTPS Communication:**  The attack is performed using the HTTPS protocol and needs to be able to establish an SSL connection with the server.
*   **Crafted Request:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, the vulnerability lies in the processing of closing handshake and requires a request that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Summary of Content:**

The provided documents consist of various Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs), a NetApp advisory, and a GitHub advisory related to CVE-2023-1108. They primarily describe that:

*   CVE-2023-1108 is related to an infinite loop in Undertow's `SslConduit` during close operation due to a change in status in newer JDK versions.
*   Multiple Red Hat products including JBoss EAP, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat Fuse, Red Hat Spring Boot, Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes are affected and require security updates.
*   NetApp products using Undertow, including Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux, Windows, and VMware vSphere, OnCommand Insight, and OnCommand Workflow Automation, are also vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   Fixes involve updating Undertow to versions 2.3.5.Final and 2.2.24.Final.
*   GitHub advisory and associated commit logs and pull requests confirm the fix in Undertow itself.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5 (High) with a network attack vector and no user interaction needed.
*   Several Red Hat bugzilla entries and associated errata provide information related to resolution in specific product versions.
