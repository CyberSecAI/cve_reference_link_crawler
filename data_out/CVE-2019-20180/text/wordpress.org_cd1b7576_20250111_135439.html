  Since 2020, security reports highlight the exposure of TablePress to CSV injections.

  The current release (1.14) is still exposed.

  Do you plan any fix to deal with this securiy issue?

  Best regards

  Hi [@globalbpa](https://wordpress.org/support/users/globalbpa/),

  thanks for your post, and sorry for the trouble.

  First: TablePress, your site, and your server are safe.

  I regard this report as invalid. Please see <https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordfence-alerts-critical-for-vulenrability/?view=all#post-16068890> , <https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordfence-alerts-critical-for-vulenrability/page/4/#post-16214632> , and my other replies in that thread for the current status.

  Best wishes,

  Tobias

  [@globalbpa](https://wordpress.org/support/users/globalbpa/) where to you get it from that v1.14 is still under thread? I read all sources as “was exposed <=1.9.2”

  Hi [@ralf-r](https://wordpress.org/support/users/ralf-r/),

  sorry for the trouble.

  Not even versions before 1.9.2 had a problem here. The mentioned report is invalid, in my opinion. Wordfence thinks otherwise, which is why they are warnin. Please see the links from above.

  TablePress, your site, and the server are safe.

  WordFence will turn off this notification once TablePress 2.0 is released, which will happen within the next week, if everything goes as planned.

  Best wishes,
  Tobias

  Hi [@globalbpa](https://wordpress.org/support/users/globalbpa/) and [@ralf-r](https://wordpress.org/support/users/ralf-r/),

  quick update: TablePress 2.0 is now available, see <https://tablepress.org/release-announcement-tablepress-2-0/>

  With this, the Wordfence notifications should now be turned off 🙂

  Best wishes,
  Tobias
