- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HiCOS Natural Person Certificate component client does not perform parameter length validation when reading the OS information of the chip card, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, perform arbitrary system operations, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, specifically when reading the OS information of a chip card using the HiCOS client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the machine running the vulnerable HiCOS client. No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
