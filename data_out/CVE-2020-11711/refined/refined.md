Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to insert arbitrary Javascript code into the login disclaimer of Stormshield Network Security (SNS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding when handling the login disclaimer. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.

While the impact is rated as partial on confidentiality, it is noted that no integrity or availability impact is present.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Disclaimer:** An attacker leverages the "login disclaimer" configuration to inject JavaScript code.
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the SNS to configure the login disclaimer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have legitimate administrative access to the SNS configuration panel to modify the login disclaimer.
- **Adjacent Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable from an adjacent network.
