  "CVE-2021-39693": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the Android Framework and could lead to local EoP with user execution privileges needed.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is related to how the `InProgress` array is handled in `AttributedAppOp`. When adding or removing elements, a call to `finish()` and then `start()` might reallocate the array, causing the reference to point to the old location. This could lead to unexpected behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of array reallocation leading to a dangling reference."
    ],
    "impact": "Local Elevation of Privilege (EoP). An attacker could potentially exploit this to gain higher privileges within the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via an application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User execution privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability."
  }
