Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1776

**Affected Software:** WordPress plugin "Admin side data storage for Contact Form 7"

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.1.1

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input, specifically the `form-id` parameter, before using it in an SQL query.
*   The SQL query is not sufficiently prepared, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the `form-id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin uses a direct string concatenation to build the SQL query instead of using prepared statements, which could have prevented the injection.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.
*   This allows the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vector:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `form-id` parameter in the plugin's settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or higher-level user on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin's settings page.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in `/inc/admin/inc/settings.php`. Specifically, lines `99` and `173` use the `form_id` value in SQL queries without proper sanitization or using prepared statements.

```php
$admin_results = $cfdata->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE zt_dcf_form_post_id = '$form_id' AND zt_dcf_form_key = 'admin_show_hide'", OBJECT );
$front_results = $cfdata->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE zt_dcf_form_post_id = '$form_id' AND zt_dcf_form_key = 'front_show_hide'", OBJECT );
```

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by "zulu caPWN".
*   There is no patch available at the time of this analysis. The recommended mitigation is to uninstall the plugin until a patch is released.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially gain access to sensitive information within the WordPress database.
