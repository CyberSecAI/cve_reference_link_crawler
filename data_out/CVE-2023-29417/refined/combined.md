| That input file is malformed:  ``` $ hexdump -C  /tmp/6.crashes.bz3 | head 00000000  02 11 00 00 08 17 15 00  42 5a 33 76 31 00 07 09  |........BZ3v1...| 00000010  00 10 00 00 00 0a 00 00  00 02 00 fd 00 db 46 0b  |..............F.| 00000020  47 ff ff ff ff 61 0a                              |G....a.| 00000027  ```  The malformation is properly caught by bzip3 tool:  ``` $ ./bzip3 -d -k -c /tmp/6.crashes.bz3  >/dev/null Invalid signature.  ```  src/main.c of bzip3 tool first expects "BZ3v1" magic string and then 4 bytes of a little-endian unsigned integer.  Contrary, examples/decompress-file.c has a very naive parser which blindly interprets first sizeof(size\_t) bytes as a size\_t value. It does not consider that a size and an endianess of size\_t differ among platforms. |

Not an issue with the bzip3 library. It's on the user's end to make sure that the buffers passed to bzip3 contain enough space to be filled with decompressed data.  Because the example code does not check for memory allocation failures, for reasons mentioned before, I am marking this issue as invalid. Please consider to further test your findings to make sure that they are an actual issue in the library, not a problem caused by contract violations - ideally problems that can be reproduced with regular `bzip3` command invocation.  ``` /* Decompress a file produced by compress-file SEQUENTIALLY (i.e. *not* in parallel) using bzip3 high level API. */ /* This is just a demonstration of bzip3 library usage, it does not contain all the necessary error checks and will not  * support cross-endian encoding/decoding. It *WILL* segfault if the input file does not exist,  * malloc returns a NULL pointer, etc... - you are expected to handle these corner cases in your code. */  ```  Further SAIS-related fuzzing and issues are welcome. |

When you can crash a library in this way by using its api, usually is a library fault. |

| Contract violations are not bugs in the library. By this logic, the C standard library crashing when you try to seek on a `FILE *` obtained using `fopen` on a file that doesn't exist is a CVE in glibc.  The example code is not a part of the library. It is not distributed in the release tarballs (see <https://github.com/kspalaiologos/bzip3/blob/master/Makefile.am#L1>). You have not found an issue in bzip3 v1.2.3 because the file `decompress-file.c` is not a part of the release. |

I'm pretty sure we are talking about different things.  The full reproduction command is:  ``` decompress_file 6.crashes.bz3 output  ```  I don't understand why are you talking about a missing file.  I see that the issue happens on `decompress-file.c:28:17` where `bz3_decompress` is called |

| `bz3_compress` crashes because `out` is a null pointer. it was improperly called. once again I have to show you the stack trace:  ``` Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. __memcpy_avx_unaligned_erms ()     at ../sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/memmove-vec-unaligned-erms.S:710 710	../sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/memmove-vec-unaligned-erms.S: No such file or directory.

The size of the output is large, hence `malloc` failed. when `malloc` inside of `decompress-file` fails, it returns `null`. the memory under `null` is not big enough for us to be able to write `0x7fffffffe448` into, hence it is not the library's fault. it is a problem with `decompress-file.c` not being robust enough.  it is impossible to determine whether the buffer passed to `bz3_decompress` will even contain enough bytes for the output, which is why we pass `out_size` to it. but the `decompress-file.c` program clearly lied to the API, and there is no way in portable C to check it. you would have to use `malloc_get_usable_size`:  ```  0 [14:55] Desktop/workspace/bzip3@master % cd examples                            22s  0 [14:55] workspace/bzip3@master/examples % gcc decompress-file.c -o decompress-file -O3 -lbzip3  0 [14:55] workspace/bzip3@master/examples % ./decompress-file ~/Desktop/6.crashes.bz3 6.crashes zsh: segmentation fault  ./decompress-file ~/Desktop/6.crashes.bz3 6.crashes  139 [14:55] workspace/bzip3@master/examples % ./decompress-file ~/Desktop/6.crashes.bz3 6.crashes zsh: segmentation fault  ./decompress-file ~/Desktop/6.crashes.bz3 6.crashes  139 [14:55] workspace/bzip3@master/examples % gdb -q decompress-file Reading symbols from decompress-file...

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-3589ad1c55
2023-04-15 02:01:33.485780
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : bzip3
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 1.3.0
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://github.com/kspalaiologos/bzip3>
Summary : Tools for compressing and decompressing bzip3 files
Description :
These are tools for compressing, decompressing, printing, and searching bzip3
files. bzip3 features higher compression ratios and better performance than
bzip2 thanks to an order-0 context mixing entropy coder, a fast
Burrows-Wheeler transform code making use of suffix arrays and a run-length
encoding with Lempel-Ziv prediction pass based on LZ77-style string matching
and PPM-style context modeling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes a memory heap corruption.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-3a821e6e73
2023-04-14 01:30:58.046019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : bzip3
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 1.3.0
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://github.com/kspalaiologos/bzip3>
Summary : Tools for compressing and decompressing bzip3 files
Description :
These are tools for compressing, decompressing, printing, and searching bzip3
files. bzip3 features higher compression ratios and better performance than
bzip2 thanks to an order-0 context mixing entropy coder, a fast
Burrows-Wheeler transform code making use of suffix arrays and a run-length
encoding with Lempel-Ziv prediction pass based on LZ77-style string matching
and PPM-style context modeling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes a memory heap corruption.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-c08f9dfc16
2023-04-14 01:05:02.596067
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : bzip3
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 1.3.0
Release : 1.fc37
URL : <https://github.com/kspalaiologos/bzip3>
Summary : Tools for compressing and decompressing bzip3 files
Description :
These are tools for compressing, decompressing, printing, and searching bzip3
files. bzip3 features higher compression ratios and better performance than
bzip2 thanks to an order-0 context mixing entropy coder, a fast
Burrows-Wheeler transform code making use of suffix arrays and a run-length
encoding with Lempel-Ziv prediction pass based on LZ77-style string matching
and PPM-style context modeling.
