- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An untrusted search path vulnerability exists in the FortiClient Windows OpenSSL component. This allows an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the use of an untrusted search path (CWE-426), which allows a malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the intended one.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can place a malicious OpenSSL engine library in a location that is part of the search path used by FortiClient.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the system's search path. This could be achieved through local access.
