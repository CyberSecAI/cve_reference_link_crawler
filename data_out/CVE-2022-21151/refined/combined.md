### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that users of affected Intel® Processors update to the latest version firmware provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.

Intel has released microcode updates for the affected Intel® Processors that are currently supported on the public github repository. Please see details below on access to the microcode:

GitHub\*: Public Github: <https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files>

This CVE requires a Microcode Security Version Number (SVN) update. To address this issue, an Intel SGX TCB Recovery is planned. Details can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/resources/q4-2022-intel-sgx-tcb-recovery-guidance.html).

Refer to [Intel® SGX Attestation Technical Details](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/technical-details/sgx-attestation-technical-details.html) for more information on the SGX TCB recovery process.

Further [TCB Recovery Guidance](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/01/7b/Intel-SGX-Trusted-Computing-Base-Recovery.pdf) for developers is available.

### Acknowledgements:

This issue was found internally by Intel employees. Intel would like to thank Alysa Milburn, Jason Brandt, Avishai Redelman, Nir Lavi for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
