Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the CVE-2023-26686 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation within the "Image Upload" functionality of CS-Cart MultiVendor 4.16.1. This lack of proper validation allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application fails to adequately check the content and type of uploaded files. It allows uploading files with malicious extensions like `.html`, `.phar`, and `.svg` disguised as images.
*  **MIME Type Spoofing:** The vulnerability is exploitable by manipulating the `Content-Type` header during the upload. For example, an SVG file (which would have `image/svg+xml` as its MIME type), can be disguised by setting `Content-Type: image/jpg`. The server does not properly validate the file content against the declared MIME type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading files with extensions such as `.phar`, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to upload `.svg` or `.html` files allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to XSS attacks. These attacks can be leveraged to steal user sessions, redirect users to malicious websites or deface the website.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any kind of file on the server, this could be used to host other malware or for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/vendor.php?dispatch=image.upload` endpoint, which is used to upload images.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is sent within the multipart/form-data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have either a vendor or admin account to access the file upload functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable CS-Cart MultiVendor installation.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by using an SVG file containing an alert script.
*   While `.php` file uploads are blocked, other executable file types like `.phar` are not, providing another avenue for exploitation.
*   The provided HTTP request and response examples clearly show how a manipulated SVG file can be successfully uploaded by specifying the incorrect Content-Type `image/jpg`
