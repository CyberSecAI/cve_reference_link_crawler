Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the EyouCMS version 1.6.4. Specifically, the application allows users to input arbitrary JavaScript code into a field within the administrative interface, which is then stored and later rendered without sufficient escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into a form field (potentially within admin settings), saved to the database, and then executed when a user views the page where the malicious content is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stealing Sensitive Information:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a logged-in user's browser session. This can lead to stealing sensitive information like session cookies, which can be used to impersonate the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Administrative Interface:** The attack vector is within the administrative interface of the EyouCMS. An attacker needs access to the admin panel to inject the malicious script.
*   **Form Field Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a specific input field within the administrative panel. This field is not specifically identified, but the context suggests it is within a settings or configuration area.
*   **Persistent Payload:** Once the malicious script is saved, it will be executed each time the affected page is loaded by any user who has access to it, making the attack persistent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or otherwise have access to an area where they can edit and save data that will be displayed to other users.
*  **Ability to Input Arbitrary Code:** Attacker must be able to enter and save the malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable input field.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) is:  `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)><`
*   The vulnerability was reported in version 1.6.4 of EyouCMS.
*   The issue has been fixed in a later version, and "strict data processing" has been implemented.
