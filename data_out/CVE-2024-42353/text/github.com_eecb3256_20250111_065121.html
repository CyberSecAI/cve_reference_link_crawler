# Location header normalization during redirect leads to open redirect

Moderate

[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)
published
GHSA-mg3v-6m49-jhp3
Aug 14, 2024

## Package

pip

webob
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.8.7

## Patched versions

1.8.8

## Description

### Impact

When WebOb normalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, it does so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to with Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` however treats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then treats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname from the second part as the hostname replacing the original one from the request.

```
>>> parse.urlparse("//example.com/test/path")
ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='example.com', path='/test/path', params='', query='', fragment='')

```

WebOb uses `urljoin` to take the request URI and joining the redirect location, so assuming the request URI is: `https://example.org//example.com/some/path`, and the URL to redirect to (for example by adding a slash automatically) is `//example.com/some/path/` that gets turned by `urljoin` into:

```
>>> parse.urljoin("https://example.org//attacker.com/some/path", "//attacker.com/some/path/")
'https://attacker.com/some/path/'

```

Which redirects from `example.org` where we want the user to stay to `attacker.com`

### Patches

This issue is patched in WebOb 1.8.8

Older versions of WebOb continue to be vulnerable to this issue, and should be avoided.

### Workarounds

Any use of the `Response` class that includes a `location` can be rewritten to make sure to always pass a full URI that includes the hostname to redirect the user to.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
