Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `formSetSpeedWan` function within the Tenda FH1202 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `speed_dir` parameter from a POST request is passed to the `formSetSpeedWan` function. This parameter is then used in a `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking, which leads to writing beyond the buffer allocated on the stack for the `nptr` variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack. This allows the attacker to redirect the program's execution flow to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** Overwriting stack memory might cause the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint with an overly long `speed_dir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface to send the malicious POST request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/SetSpeedWan` and the vulnerable parameter `speed_dir`.

**Additional details from the content:**
- Vulnerable Firmware: Tenda FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408)
- The `sprintf` function is used to copy the attacker controlled input (`speed_dir`) into a stack based buffer, without proper bounds checking.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script is provided to demonstrate the exploit. The script sends a POST request with a long string of 'a's as the `speed_dir` parameter.
