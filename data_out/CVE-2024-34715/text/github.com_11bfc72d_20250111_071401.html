| This is baffling me so I thought I'd throw it out and see if anyone else has run into this or can recreate it.  I've had a db password with a $ in it for months and yesterday I updated from sqlalchemy 1.4.14 to 1.4.17 and started getting exceptions on the connection string. Given a password of my$pwd I get the following out on the server:  ```   File "/opt/python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/psycopg2/__init__.py", line 127, in connect     conn = _connect(dsn, connection_factory=connection_factory, **kwasync) sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name "$pwd@dbname" to address: Name or service not known  ```  which looks like a parsing problem.  And trying it locally against a postgres instance in a docker container I get a different but similar error:  ```         dsn = _ext.make_dsn(dsn, **kwargs) >       conn = _connect(dsn, connection_factory=connection_factory, **kwasync) E       sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres"  ```  locally I'm using: sqlalchemy==1.4.14 psycopg2-binary==2.8.6 postgres=12.7 (but 12.5 and 12.6 have the same issue)  Tracing it down sqlalchemy seems to be parsing the password just fine and it only fails once it hits: `connection = pool._invoke_creator(self)` here: <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/pool/base.py#L605>  So it seems like its failing in the driver... (but I haven't changed that recently)  locally my connection string looks like this: postgresql://postgres:my$pwd@127.0.0.1:5001/my\_db  Is anyone else able to reproduce this? |

make sure you use URL escaping for passwords:

<https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#database-urls>

some issues in URL parsing were fixed a few 1.4 versions ago which unfortunately caused some unavoidable regressions in some passwords.

| tried adding something here [https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org/c/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/+/3754](https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org/c/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/%2B/3754) but it may be a bit too much with all these dragons |

| I would use ..seealso without any specific warning for most of those boxes. I would put "..note" only under the `:param password:` description.  Overall, this is not a long term issue. the reason we keep hearing about it is because we made a backwards incompatible change in the URL scheme so we are getting people who are upgrading. We are already getting fewer of these and eventually it will be a non-issue. |
