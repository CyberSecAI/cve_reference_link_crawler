Debian Bug     : 945251 959448 980891 989992 991593

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in otrs2, the Open-Source Ticket
Request System, which could lead to impersonation, denial of service,
information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11358

    A Prototype Pollution vulnerability was discovered in OTRS' embedded
    jQuery 3.2.1 copy, which could allow sending drafted messages as
    wrong agent.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-05.

CVE-2019-12248

    Matthias Terlinde discovered that when an attacker sends a malicious
    email to an OTRS system and a logged in agent user later quotes it,
    the email could cause the browser to load external image resources.

    A new configuration setting &#x2018;Ticket::Frontend::BlockLoadingRemoteContent&#x2019;
    has been added as part of the fix.  It controls whether external
    content should be loaded, and it is disabled by default.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-08.

CVE-2019-12497

    Jens Meister discovered that in the customer or external frontend,
    personal information of agents, like Name and mail address in
    external notes, could be disclosed.

    New configuration settings &#x2018;Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketZoom###DisplayNoteFrom&#x2019;
    has been added as part of the fix.  It controls if agent information
    should be displayed in external note sender field, or be substituted
    with a different generic name.  Another option named
    &#x2018;Ticket::Frontend::CustomerTicketZoom###DefaultAgentName&#x2019; can then
    be used to define the generic agent name used in the latter case.
    By default, previous behavior is preserved, in which agent
    information is divulged in the external note From field, for the
    sake of backwards compatibility.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-09.

CVE-2019-12746

    A user logged into OTRS as an agent might unknowingly disclose their
    session ID by sharing the link of an embedded ticket article with
    third parties.  This identifier can be then potentially abused in
    order to impersonate the agent user.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-10.

CVE-2019-13458

    An attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent user with
    appropriate permissions can leverage OTRS tags in templates in order
    to disclose hashed user passwords.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-12.

CVE-2019-16375

    An attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent or customer user
    with appropriate permissions can create a carefully crafted string
    containing malicious JavaScript code as an article body.  This
    malicious code is executed when an agent compose an answer to the
    original article.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-13.

CVE-2019-18179

    An attacker who is logged into OTRS as an agent is able to list
    tickets assigned to other agents, which are in the queue where
    attacker doesn't have permissions.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-14.

CVE-2019-18180

    OTRS can be put into an endless loop by providing filenames with
    overly long extensions.  This applies to the PostMaster (sending in
    email) and also upload (attaching files to mails, for example).

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2019-15.

CVE-2020-1765

    Sebastian Renker and Jonas Becker discovered an improper control of
    parameters, which allows the spoofing of the From fields in several
    screens, namely AgentTicketCompose, AgentTicketForward,
    AgentTicketBounce and AgentTicketEmailOutbound.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-01.

CVE-2020-1766

    Anton Astaf'ev discovered that due to improper handling of uploaded
    images, it is possible &#x2014; in very unlikely and rare conditions &#x2014; to
    force the agents browser to execute malicious JavaScript from a
    special crafted SVG file rendered as inline jpg file.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-02.

CVE-2020-1767

    Agent A is able to save a draft (i.e., for customer reply).  Then
    Agent B can open the draft, change the text completely and send it
    in the name of Agent A.  For the customer it will not be visible
    that the message was sent by another agent.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-03.

CVE-2020-1769

    Martin M&#xF8;ller discovered that in the login screens (in agent and
    customer interface), Username and Password fields use autocomplete,
    which might be considered as security issue.

    A new configuration setting &#x2018;DisableLoginAutocomplete&#x2019; has been
    added as part of the fix.  It controls whether to disable
    autocompletion in the login forms, by setting the
    autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; attribute to the login input fields.  Note that
    some browsers ignore it by default (usually it can be changed in the
    browser configuration).

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-06.

CVE-2020-1770

    Matthias Terlinde discovered that the support bundle generated files
    could contain sensitive information, such as user credentials.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-07.

CVE-2020-1771

    Christoph Wuetschne discovered that an attacker is able craft an
    article with a link to the customer address book with malicious
    content (JavaScript).  When agent opens the link, JavaScript code is
    executed due to the missing parameter encoding.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-08.

CVE-2020-1772

    Fabian Henneke discovered that it is possible to craft Lost Password
    requests with wildcards in the Token value, which allows an attacker
    to retrieve valid Token(s), generated by users which already
    requested new passwords.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-09.

CVE-2020-1773

    Fabian Henneke discovered that an attacker with the ability to
    generate session IDs or password reset tokens, either by being able
    to authenticate or by exploiting CVE-2020-1772, may be able to
    predict other users session IDs, password reset tokens and
    automatically generated passwords.

    The fix adds &#x2018;libmath-random-secure-perl&#x2019; to otrs2's Depends:.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-10.

CVE-2020-1774

    When a user downloads PGP or S/MIME keys/certificates, exported file
    has same name for private and public keys.  It is therefore possible
    to mix them and to send private key to the third-party instead of
    public key.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-11.

CVE-2020-1776

    When an agent user is renamed or set to invalid the session
    belonging to the user is keept active.  The session can not be used
    to access ticket data in the case the agent is invalid.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2020-13.

    Erik Krogh Kristensen and Alvaro Mu&#xF1;oz from the GitHub Security Lab
    team discovered a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    vulnerability in OTRS' embedded jQuery-validate 1.16.0 copy.

CVE-2021-21439

    A Denial of Service (DoS) attack can be performed when an email
    contains specially designed URL in the body.  It can lead to the
    high CPU usage and cause low quality of service, or in extreme case
    bring the system to a halt.

    This vulnerability is also known as OSA-2021-09 or ZSA-2021-03.

CVE-2021-21440

    Julian Droste and Mathias Terlinde discovered that the Generated
    Support Bundles contains private S/MIME and PGP keys when the parent
