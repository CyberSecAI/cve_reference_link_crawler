{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Guzzle HTTP client library did not correctly strip the `Cookie` header when a redirect occurred from an HTTPS URI to an HTTP URI, or from a URI to a different host, potentially exposing sensitive cookie data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the failure of the library to remove the `Cookie` header in specific redirect scenarios, leading to potential information disclosure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker might be able to intercept the `Cookie` header sent by a client if a redirect happens from `https` to `http` or a cross-host redirect, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive user information and possibly leading to session hijacking or impersonation attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a server sending a redirect response that causes a client to send a subsequent request to a URI with a different scheme (`https` to `http`) or a different host, while retaining the `Cookie` header from the initial request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a position to control the server's responses, either directly or by compromising it, in order to send a redirect to a different scheme or host."
