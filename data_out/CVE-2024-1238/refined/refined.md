Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1238

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the ElementsKit Elementor Addons plugin, specifically in the handling of the button ID parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that malicious scripts injected by an attacker are stored within the database and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- **User compromise:** The injected scripts can potentially perform actions on behalf of the user viewing the page, leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page, including redirecting users to malicious sites or serving malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the 'button ID' parameter of the button widget within the ElementsKit plugin.
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" access privileges to the WordPress site, enabling them to create or modify content.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 3.0.6.
The fix was implemented in version 3.0.7, which includes improved sanitization of the button widget.
The specific file modified to fix the issue is `/trunk/widgets/button/button.php` and `/tags/3.0.7/widgets/button/button.php`.
The `id` attribute of the button element was being directly output without sanitization, leading to the stored XSS.

The Wordfence article notes the vulnerability is found in the button ID parameter, while the Trac changeset shows that `elementskit-lite/trunk/widgets/button/button.php` was modified with sanitization improvements to `btn_id`.
The changelog for 3.0.7 also notes "Improved: Button widget sanitization".
