- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `url-regex` package is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to a poorly constructed regular expression.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The regular expression used by the package can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing certain inputs, causing excessive CPU consumption. The vulnerability is present in all versions of the package prior to a fix.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service by causing the affected system to become unresponsive due to excessive CPU usage.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input strings to the `url_regex.UrlRegex` function that triggers catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker only needs to be able to provide a malicious input string to the vulnerable component. This can be done remotely over a network.
