- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Mendix applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows an attacker with access to an active user session to change the user's password, bypassing password validations, potentially setting weak passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the password of an active user, potentially gaining unauthorized access or disrupting the user's access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves gaining access to an active user session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to an active user session within a vulnerable Mendix application. The CVSS vector indicates the following:
    - **AV:N (Network)**: The attack can occur over a network.
    - **AC:L (Low)**: The attack complexity is low.
    - **PR:H (High)**: The attacker needs high privileges. This is potentially misleading, as access to an active user session is not a traditional "privilege," however, it can be interpreted as requiring a high level of access to the application itself (as opposed to a user having an account).
    - **UI:N (None)**: No user interaction is required.
    - **S:U (Unchanged)**: The security scope is unchanged.
    - **C:N (None)**: There is no impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:H (High)**: There is a high impact on integrity (password change).
    - **A:N (None)**: There is no impact on availability.
    - **E:P (Proof-of-concept)**: A proof-of-concept exploit exists.
    - **RL:O (Official fix)**: An official fix is available.
    - **RC:C (Confirmed)**: The vulnerability is confirmed.
