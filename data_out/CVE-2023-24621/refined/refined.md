Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2023-24621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the YamlBeans library's ability to deserialize YAML data into Java classes, where the class to be instantiated is determined by the YAML content itself, overriding any class specified by the developer in the code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Untrusted Polymorphic Deserialization:** YamlBeans allows the YAML file to specify the Java class for deserialization, bypassing the class specified in the application code.
- **Uncontrolled Class Instantiation:** The application instantiates classes specified in the YAML file, potentially allowing for the instantiation of malicious classes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a YAML file containing a malicious class, an attacker can cause the application to instantiate and execute arbitrary code.
- **Data manipulation/exfiltration:** By controlling the class that is instantiated, an attacker may be able to manipulate or exfiltrate application data.
- **Complete compromise:** A successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the application and the server it is running on.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a specially crafted YAML file through an endpoint that uses the `YamlReader` to deserialize user-controlled data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a YAML file to the application for deserialization. This typically means having access to an application endpoint that reads and processes YAML data.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists because `YamlBeans` prioritizes the class name defined in the YAML file over the class specified in `reader.read(Config.class)` or `reader.read()`.
- The provided PoC demonstrates that a YAML like `!com.contrast.labs.yamlbeanspoc.Gadget cmd: "open /System/Applications/Calculator.app"` will instantiate the `Gadget` class instead of `Config.class` and set the `cmd` variable using the `setCmd()` method.
- The vulnerability can be exploited with any Java class following the JavaBean specification which includes:
    - Public no-args constructor.
    - Private variables.
    - Getters and setters that follow the JavaBean spec
- This vulnerability is similar to Jackson-Databind's polymorphic deserialization issues but Jackson does not check the underlying variable name. Just looks for setter method and calls it with the supplied value.
