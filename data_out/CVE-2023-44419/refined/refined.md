- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the `prog.cgi` binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending HNAP requests to the lighttpd webserver. Authentication is not required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
