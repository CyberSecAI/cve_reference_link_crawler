  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2023-40137",
      "description": "A security vulnerability was identified in the Autofill functionality, where a malicious Autofill provider could potentially expose content from another user. This is due to the lack of verification of URI permissions within FillResponse's RemoteViews.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the system does not properly check URI permissions before displaying RemoteViews within FillResponse. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious Autofill provider that can access and display content from URIs that the current user doesn't have permission to view.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient URI permission checks",
        "Lack of authorization enforcement"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious Autofill provider could display content from URIs that the current user does not have permission to access, leading to unauthorized viewing of sensitive information belonging to other users.",
        "attack_vectors": "A malicious application acting as an Autofill provider.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Autofill provider application. The attacker does not need any additional execution privileges to exploit this vulnerability."
