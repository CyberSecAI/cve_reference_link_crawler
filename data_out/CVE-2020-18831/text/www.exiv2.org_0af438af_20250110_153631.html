Exiv2 is developed on GNU/Linux with recent versions of
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/ "The GNU Compiler Collection").
Written in C++, it uses the standard C++ library, some POSIX
and C functions, and is portable. Dependencies are on
[zlib](http://www.zlib.net "zlib homepage") for PNG
support,
[gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ "gettext homepage")
for NLS,
[libiconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ "libiconv homepage")
for characterset conversions and
[Expat](http://expat.sourceforge.net/ "Expat homepage") for XMP support.
(Note: current Linux distributions usually have gettext and iconv in libc
and these features can be disabled individually.)
