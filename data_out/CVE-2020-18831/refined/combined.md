Exiv2 is developed on GNU/Linux with recent versions of
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/ "The GNU Compiler Collection").
Written in C++, it uses the standard C++ library, some POSIX
and C functions, and is portable. Dependencies are on
[zlib](http://www.zlib.net "zlib homepage") for PNG
support,
[gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ "gettext homepage")
for NLS,
[libiconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ "libiconv homepage")
for characterset conversions and
[Expat](http://expat.sourceforge.net/ "Expat homepage") for XMP support.
(Note: current Linux distributions usually have gettext and iconv in libc
and these features can be disabled individually.)

### **[VenusADLab](/VenusADLab)** commented [May 6, 2019](#issue-440554840)

| **Describe the bug** An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.27.1. There is reading beyond buffer at tEXtToDataBuf in the file pngimage.cpp. This can be triggered by a crafted file. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behaviour:   1. Provide image with which you observed the issue    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40753101/57208565-06a3f080-7007-11e9-9ad8-380ece8e678f.png) 2. Provide exact command to reproduce the issue    ./exiv2 -pR poc   **Expected behavior** Print picture information correctly without generating Segmentation fault  **Desktop (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Ubuntu18.04 64\_bit * Compiler & Version [gcc 7.3.0 ; g++ 7.3.0] * Compilation mode and/or compiler flags   cmake -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=BuildPath -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug   **Additional context** function named tEXtToDataBuf is called in pgnimage.cpp:329.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40753101/57208840-6bac1600-7008-11e9-9c77-96f15331f205.png)  but argument (dataOffset-name\_l) value is evalued to 0xFFFFFFFF,so that read beyond buffer in pgnimage.cpp:329. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40753101/57209137-de69c100-7009-11e9-83a1-4300d60e4004.png)  The POC is here: [id^%000000,sig^%11,src^%000163,op^%flip1,pos^%1129.zip](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/files/3146651/id.000000.sig.11.src.000163.op.flip1.pos.1129.zip) |
