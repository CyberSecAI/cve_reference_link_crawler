- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress VK Block Patterns plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions they are not supposed to have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized modification or access to data.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users by sending requests to the affected function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication. They need to send a specific request to trigger the vulnerable function.
