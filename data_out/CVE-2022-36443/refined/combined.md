## Benefits of Enterprise Home Screen

##

##### Control Available Applications and Features

##### Control Available Applications and Features

Enterprise Home Screen provides features to increase productivity and ensure appropriate use of your Zebra Android mobile computers - specify a set of applications users can access, disable device features and functionality and automatically launch applications your workers use so they are ready and available as soon as the device is on.

##### Create a Single-Purpose Device with Kiosk Mode

##### Create a Single-Purpose Device with Kiosk Mode

If you have users that only need to access a single application, you can automatically launch that application when the device is powered on and prevent them from exiting the application – ensuring that your Zebra Android mobile computers will always be utilized for work.

##### Secure Your Enterprise Home Screen Environments

##### Secure Your Enterprise Home Screen Environments

With government-grade security, Secure mode ensures that your Zebra Android mobile computers will only run Enterprise Home Screen configuration files that are signed by an authorized administrator, preventing technology savvy users from gaining full access to device features and applications.
