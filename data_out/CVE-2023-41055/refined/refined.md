Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `wikipedia_language` cookie in the `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` files. This cookie's value is directly incorporated into the URL used for fetching data from Wikipedia, without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. The application allows an attacker to control a portion of the URL used to make an HTTP GET request from the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `wikipedia_language` cookie, allowing arbitrary values to be used in constructing the URL. This enables the attacker to inject malicious URLs.
*   **Unsanitized User Input:** The cookie data, which is user-controlled input, is directly used in the construction of an external URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTTP GET Requests:** An attacker can force the server to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary URLs they specify.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By directing the server to download large files, attackers can cause a denial of service, degrading the server's performance or making it inaccessible.
*   **Bypassing CDN Protection:** If the server is behind a CDN, the attacker can potentially expose the server's origin IP address by making it request resources directly, bypassing DDoS protection mechanisms offered by the CDN.
*  **Blind SSRF:** The response is decoded as JSON, limiting the attacker's ability to see the response, this however, does not reduce the impact of the other exploits that can be carried out.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `wikipedia_language` cookie in the browser or through a crafted request to inject malicious URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Cookie Control:** The attacker needs to be able to set or modify the `wikipedia_language` cookie.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` before commit `be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744`.
*   The issue is fixed in commit `be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744` in pull request #9.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates both SSRF and DoS attacks, showing how to trigger arbitrary GET requests and download large files.
*  The fix was implemented in pull request #9 and includes sanitization of the `wikipedia_language` cookie.
*  The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checks) and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)
