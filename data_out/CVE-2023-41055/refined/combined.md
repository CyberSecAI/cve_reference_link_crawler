>= be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744

## Description

## Summary

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` before commit [be59098](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/commit/be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744) allows remote attackers to request the server to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via the `wikipedia_language` cookie.

## Details

In `engines/google/text.php`, the `wikipedia_language` cookie is used as the first part of the URL where a GET request is sent to.

[LibreY/engines/google/text.php](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/blob/3687c4b40f66b96bcb3a2194114f9e77c6a4afcb/engines/google/text.php#L55-L63)

[3687c4b](/Ahwxorg/LibreY/commit/3687c4b40f66b96bcb3a2194114f9e77c6a4afcb)

|  | case 7: |
| --- | --- |
|  | $wikipedia\_language = isset($\_COOKIE["wikipedia\_language"]) ? trim(htmlspecialchars($\_COOKIE["wikipedia\_language"])) : $config->wikipedia\_language; |
|  | $url = "https://$wikipedia\_language.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=extracts%7Cpageimages&exintro&explaintext&redirects=1&pithumbsize=500&titles=$query\_encoded"; |
|  | break; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | if ($url != NULL) |
|  | { |
|  | $special\_ch = curl\_init($url); |

If the cookie contains a slash, the domain is no longer `wikipedia.org`. If the cookie further ends with a hash sign, the `.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?...` will become the hash of the URL and the path of the request target can also be controlled by the attacker.

So the attacker can make the server send arbitrary GET requests, and DoS attacks can be conducted by requesting the server to download large files. If the server is behind a CDN, the original IP address can be disclosed via SSRF, so the DDoS protection provided by the CDN could be bypassed.

Fortunately, in `engines/special/wikipedia.php`, the response is decoded as JSON, so this is almost a blind SSRF where the attacker cannot see the response.

[LibreY/engines/special/wikipedia.php](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/blob/3687c4b40f66b96bcb3a2194114f9e77c6a4afcb/engines/special/wikipedia.php#L2-L34)

|  | $json\_response = json\_decode($response, true); |
|  |  |
|  | $first\_page = array\_values($json\_response["query"]["pages"])[0]; |
|  |  |
|  | if (!array\_key\_exists("missing", $first\_page)) |
|  | { |
|  | $description = substr($first\_page["extract"], 0, 250) . "..."; |
|  |  |
|  | $wikipedia\_language = isset($\_COOKIE["wikipedia\_language"]) ? trim(htmlspecialchars($\_COOKIE["wikipedia\_language"])) : $config->wikipedia\_language; |
|  |  |
|  | $source = check\_for\_privacy\_frontend("https://$wikipedia\_language.wikipedia.org/wiki/$query"); |
|  | $response = array( |
|  | "special\_response" => array( |
|  | "response" => htmlspecialchars($description), |
|  | "source" => $source |
|  | ) |
|  | ); |
|  |  |
|  | if (array\_key\_exists("thumbnail", $first\_page)) |
|  | { |
|  | $image\_url = $first\_page["thumbnail"]["source"]; |
|  | $response["special\_response"]["image"] = $image\_url; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | return $response; |
|  | } |
|  | } |

## PoC

### SSRF

1. Get a URL at <https://requestrepo.com/>, e.g. `xxx.requestrepo.com`.
2. Set `wikipedia_language` to `xxx.requestrepo.com/foo#`.
3. Search "bar".
4. Observe a request for `https://xxx.requestrepo.com/foo` at <https://requestrepo.com/>.

### DoS

Send requests to `/search.php?q=dos` with header `Cookie: wikipedia_language=speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin#` multiple times, and then send normal requests to see long response time or errors.

## Impact

Remote attackers can request the server to download large files to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users.

Remote attackers can get the IP address of the server even if it is behind a CDN.

## Patches

This has been fixed in [#9](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/9).

LibreY hosters are advised to use the latest commit, and LibreX hosters are advised to migrate to LibreY.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
