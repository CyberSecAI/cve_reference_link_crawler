Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the `mybatis-mappers/DeptMapper.xml` file to directly splice SQL statements using user-controlled input (`params.dataScope`). This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly embeds user-provided input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user input (`params.dataScope`) before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database through SQL injection.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the application.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If the database user used by the application has elevated privileges, the attacker may be able to escalate their privileges within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request containing the `params[dataScope]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint (`/api/dept`).
- The attacker needs knowledge of how the parameters are passed into the application, specifically the `params[dataScope]` parameter.
-  No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement, suggesting the endpoint might be accessible without prior authentication (though this requires further validation).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text includes a Proof-of-Concept (POC) that demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using sqlmap.
- It also includes screenshots detailing the path of the vulnerable parameter from the XML mapper file to the controller.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `my-springsecurity-plus` before `2024.07.03`.
- The application uses Mybatis as its ORM and the issue is within the mapper XML configuration.
