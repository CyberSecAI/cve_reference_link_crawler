The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) standard, but none of them are related to CVE-2023-23772. The vulnerabilities are collectively called TETRA:BURST and include:

*   **CVE-2022-24401:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator relies on the network time, which is broadcasted in an unauthenticated manner.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication of network time allows for manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Decryption oracle attacks are possible, leading to loss of confidentiality and authenticity.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker can manipulate network time.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Active attacker with ability to manipulate network broadcasts.
*   **CVE-2022-24402:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The TEA1 algorithm has a backdoor which reduces the effective key size.
    *  **Weakness:** Intentional weakening of TEA1 cipher.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and authenticity, trivial to brute force.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Passive or active, depending on desired outcome.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:**  Low, can be done on consumer hardware.
*   **CVE-2022-24404:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of ciphertext authentication on AIE.
    *  **Weakness:** No integrity check for ciphertext.
    *   **Impact:** Malleability attacks, loss of authenticity.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker can modify messages.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Active attacker with ability to manipulate communication traffic.
*   **CVE-2022-24403:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Weak design of the cryptographic scheme used to obfuscate radio identities.
    *   **Weakness:** Weak obfuscation of radio identities
    *   **Impact:** User deanonymization and tracking.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Passive attacker can observe communication.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Passive attacker able to eavesdrop on communication.
*   **CVE-2022-24400:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Flaw in the authentication algorithm allows setting the Derived Cypher Key (DCK) to 0.
    *   **Weakness:** Weakness in the key derivation process.
    *  **Impact:** Loss of authenticity/partial loss of confidentiality.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Active attacker can manipulate authentication.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Active attacker able to manipulate authentication process.
