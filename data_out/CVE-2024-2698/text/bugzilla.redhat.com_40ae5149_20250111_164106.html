Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check\_allowed\_to\_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request. In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb\_match\_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-19 21:04:41 UTC  ``` Description: Delegation rules allow a "proxy" service to impersonate any user to access another "target" service. The vulnerability allows an attacker, once they managed to compromise a service which is a proxy in at least one delegation rule, to impersonate any user against any service that is not a target service in one of its delegation rule.  As an example, it would allow an attacker, after they compromised a server having a delegation rule to an NFS server, to impersonate a domain administrator against a FreeIPA server. This would mean compromising the all domain.  If there are no custom delegation rules in a FreeIPA domain, this vulnerability will most likely have no impact.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c4)  Sandipan Roy    2024-06-10 13:20:37 UTC  ``` Created freeipa tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2291165](show_bug.cgi?id=2291165 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-2698 freeipa: delegation rules allow a proxy service to impersonate any user to access another target service [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:06:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:3754 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3754](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3754)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:17:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:3755 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3755](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3755)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:21:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2270353#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-10 14:44:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:3757 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3757](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3757)   ``` |  |
