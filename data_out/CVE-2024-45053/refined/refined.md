Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2024-45053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Fides webserver's email templating feature used the Jinja2 templating engine without proper input sanitization or restrictions on the rendering environment. This allowed for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The Jinja2 environment used to render email templates did not restrict the usage of common Python methods and objects. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious code within the templates.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application did not sanitize user-provided email templates, which allowed for injection of arbitrary code.
- **Insufficient Rendering Environment Restrictions:** The Jinja2 environment was not properly sandboxed, granting attackers access to Python internals and the ability to execute code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers with sufficient privileges (Owner, Contributor, or `messaging-template:update` scope) could inject malicious code into email templates, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Fides Webserver container.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allowed attackers to escalate their privileges to those of a user on the Fides Webserver container.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This escalated access granted attackers control of the Fides Webserver application and access to integrated resources such as the hosted database, cache, data stores, and SaaS applications.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Potential impacts included the exfiltration of sensitive data unavailable prior to the escalation of access.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could potentially cause a denial of service by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email Template Modification:** Attackers with the ability to modify email templates (via the Admin UI or API) could inject malicious code.
- **Fides Webserver API:** OAuth clients with the `messaging-template:update` scope could use the `PUT /api/v1/messaging/templates/` endpoint to update email templates with malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged User Access:** Attackers need to be either:
    - Admin UI users with the `Owner` or `Contributor` role.
    - OAuth clients with the `messaging-template:update` scope.
- **Ability to Modify Email Templates:** Attackers must be able to modify email templates through the UI or API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions `>= 2.19.0, <2.44.0` of the `ethyca-fides` package.
- The vulnerability was patched in version `2.44.0`.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) payload is provided that demonstrates how to execute a command on the underlying system.
- The fix replaces Jinja2 templating with a simple string replacement, using variables in the format `__VARIABLE_NAME__` instead of `{{variable_name}}`.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 (Critical).
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Template Engine).
