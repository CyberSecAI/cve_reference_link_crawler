**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The IBM Maximo Asset Management application is vulnerable to XXE attacks. This implies that the application is parsing XML input from an untrusted source and processing external entities without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of the XXE vulnerability is not explicitly detailed but typically includes:
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information or internal files on the server.
- **Availability:** The attacker could cause a denial-of-service by exploiting the vulnerability to exhaust system resources.
- **Integrity:** An attacker might modify data on the server, depending on the application's functionality and server configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious XML data containing references to external entities that the application will process. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML data to the vulnerable application. This suggests that the application is processing user supplied XML data or XML from an untrusted source. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability depending on the endpoint handling the request.
