## OTP 25.1

Erlang/OTP 25.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as quite many small improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

### crypto:

* Crypto is now considered to be usable with the OpenSSL

  3.0 cryptolib for production code.

  ENGINE and FIPS are not yet fully functional.
* Changed the behaviour of the engine load/unload

  functions

### ssl:

* A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It

  is registered as CVE-2022-37026 ‚ÄúClient Authentication

  Bypass‚Äù. Corrections have been released on the

  supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and

  25.0.2. The vulnerability might also exist in older OTP

  versions. We recommend that impacted users upgrade to

  one of these versions or later on the respective

  tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice.

  Impacted are those who are running an `ssl/tls/dtls`

  server using the `ssl` application either directly or

  indirectly via other applications. For example via

  `inets` (`httpd`), `cowboy`, etc. Note that the vulnerability

  only affects servers that request client certification,

  that is sets the option `{verify, verify_peer}`.

After upgrading to this release, `rebar3 eunit` is failing after the `exact_execution` is not in the options list, in here [otp/eunit\_data.erl at c194380712236c301188f0b401352f14c608c145 ¬∑ u3s/otp ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/u3s/otp/blob/c194380712236c301188f0b401352f14c608c145/lib/eunit/src/eunit_data.erl#L581) ![:cry:](https://erlangforums.com/images/emoji/apple/cry.png?v=12 ":cry:")

---

To be precise, the error is that options is an empty list! So all `proplists:X/2` will fail with a `function_clause` error when executed.

Check the Erlang/OTP github repo, both open issues and pull requests. There are multiple reports about rebar3 eunit failing with OTP-25.1. In particular see [eunit: Fix `$ rebar3 eunit` error on OTP 25.1 by sile ¬∑ Pull Request #6322 ¬∑ erlang/otp ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/6322) . I would recommend people to stay on 25.0.4 until a patch release (likely 25.1.1 but who knows) fixes the issue.

Currently we are using Erlang 25.1.2 Version for the purpose of RabbitMQ and we have a security Vulnerability identified as part of Erlang otp installation, which indicates Erlang 25.1.2 using Crypto.dll (5.2.1) which using a vulnerable Openssl 1.1.1q. Is this vulnerable valid and is crypto.dll using OpenSll.1.1.1q or some other latest version?

OTP-25.1.2 does not depend on a special version of OpenSSL that depends on your build. If the vulnerability is for OpenSSL protocol implementation it is not relevant for OTP only if the vulnerability is on the libcrypto functions will it also affect OTP.

Package        : erlang
Version        : 1:22.2.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37026
Debian Bug     : 1024632

A Client Authentication Bypass vulnerability has been discovered in the
concurrent, real-time, distributed functional language Erlang. Impacted are
those who are running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl application
either directly or indirectly via other applications. Note that the
vulnerability only affects servers that request client certification, that
is sets the option {verify, verify_peer}.

Additionally the source package elixir-lang has been rebuilt against the new
erlang version. The rabbitmq-server package was upgraded to version 3.8.2 to
fix an incompatibility with Erlang 22.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:22.2.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your erlang packages.

For the detailed security status of erlang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/erlang>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

    ‚Ä¶

   ```
   When two ensure_engine_loaded() calls were done in parallell there
   was a possibility that a crypto lib function was called by both instead
   of just one of them.

   This is solved by moving the implementation from erlang down into a nif
   function that uses a mutex to protect the sensitive part.

    ‚Ä¶

   ```
   This is a pragmatic semi-solution to remove the symptom of a bug
   that could cause invalid Size field in NEW_FUN_EXT encoded toward
   a pending connection.
   The Size field is not used for anything else than this sanitity check
   so I see it safe to accept NEW_FUN_EXT from buggy senders.

   erl_interface still relies on Size so I guess we have to fix the
   encoding bug also, even though sending funs to erl_interface is not
   that common.
