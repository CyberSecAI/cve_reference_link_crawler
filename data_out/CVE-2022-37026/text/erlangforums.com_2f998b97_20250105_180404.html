## OTP 25.1

Erlang/OTP 25.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as quite many small improvements.

Below are some highlights of the release:

### crypto:

* Crypto is now considered to be usable with the OpenSSL

  3.0 cryptolib for production code.

  ENGINE and FIPS are not yet fully functional.
* Changed the behaviour of the engine load/unload

  functions

### ssl:

* A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It

  is registered as CVE-2022-37026 “Client Authentication

  Bypass”. Corrections have been released on the

  supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and

  25.0.2. The vulnerability might also exist in older OTP

  versions. We recommend that impacted users upgrade to

  one of these versions or later on the respective

  tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice.

  Impacted are those who are running an `ssl/tls/dtls`

  server using the `ssl` application either directly or

  indirectly via other applications. For example via

  `inets` (`httpd`), `cowboy`, etc. Note that the vulnerability

  only affects servers that request client certification,

  that is sets the option `{verify, verify_peer}`.

After upgrading to this release, `rebar3 eunit` is failing after the `exact_execution` is not in the options list, in here [otp/eunit\_data.erl at c194380712236c301188f0b401352f14c608c145 · u3s/otp · GitHub](https://github.com/u3s/otp/blob/c194380712236c301188f0b401352f14c608c145/lib/eunit/src/eunit_data.erl#L581) ![:cry:](https://erlangforums.com/images/emoji/apple/cry.png?v=12 ":cry:")

---

To be precise, the error is that options is an empty list! So all `proplists:X/2` will fail with a `function_clause` error when executed.

Check the Erlang/OTP github repo, both open issues and pull requests. There are multiple reports about rebar3 eunit failing with OTP-25.1. In particular see [eunit: Fix `$ rebar3 eunit` error on OTP 25.1 by sile · Pull Request #6322 · erlang/otp · GitHub](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/6322) . I would recommend people to stay on 25.0.4 until a patch release (likely 25.1.1 but who knows) fixes the issue.

Currently we are using Erlang 25.1.2 Version for the purpose of RabbitMQ and we have a security Vulnerability identified as part of Erlang otp installation, which indicates Erlang 25.1.2 using Crypto.dll (5.2.1) which using a vulnerable Openssl 1.1.1q. Is this vulnerable valid and is crypto.dll using OpenSll.1.1.1q or some other latest version?

OTP-25.1.2 does not depend on a special version of OpenSSL that depends on your build. If the vulnerability is for OpenSSL protocol implementation it is not relevant for OTP only if the vulnerability is on the libcrypto functions will it also affect OTP.
