Package        : erlang
Version        : 1:22.2.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-37026
Debian Bug     : 1024632

A Client Authentication Bypass vulnerability has been discovered in the
concurrent, real-time, distributed functional language Erlang. Impacted are
those who are running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl application
either directly or indirectly via other applications. Note that the
vulnerability only affects servers that request client certification, that
is sets the option {verify, verify_peer}.

Additionally the source package elixir-lang has been rebuilt against the new
erlang version. The rabbitmq-server package was upgraded to version 3.8.2 to
fix an incompatibility with Erlang 22.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:22.2.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your erlang packages.

For the detailed security status of erlang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
