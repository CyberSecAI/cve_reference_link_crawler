Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

- The primary root cause across all four vulnerabilities is the lack of strict verification of the current user's identity and permissions before allowing access to user management functions. This allows users to perform actions beyond their intended scope of authority.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Sensitive Information Leakage:** The system allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information.
2.  **Privilege Escalation:** Users can elevate their privileges to perform administrative actions.
3.  **Arbitrary User Deletion:** Users can delete other user accounts without proper authorization.
4.  **Arbitrary User Password Reset:** Users can reset passwords for other user accounts without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Breach:** Sensitive user information can be exposed leading to privacy violations.
-   **Unauthorized Access & Control:** Attackers can gain administrative privileges, allowing them to control the system or other user accounts.
-   **Denial of Service:** Ability to delete user accounts can cause a denial of service for legitimate users.
-   **Account Takeover:** Ability to reset user passwords can lead to account takeover by malicious users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerabilities stem from direct interaction with the application's user management features, likely through the application's interface or API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application
- The attacker would need to leverage the lack of proper permission checks.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided GitHub issue includes links to PDF files that likely contain further detail, including more specific attack steps.
- The developer suggests implementing API authentication and adhering to the principle of least privilege as repair suggestions.
