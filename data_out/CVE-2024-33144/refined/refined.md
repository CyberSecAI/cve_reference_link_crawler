Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `com.j2eefast.flowable.bpm.controller.TaskController: com.j2eefast.common.core.utils.ResponseData applyedList()` function in J2EEFAST. This function fails to properly sanitize or filter the `sql_filter` parameter.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization/filtering for the `sql_filter` parameter. This allows for SQL injection.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation through SQL injection could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, potentially leading to full compromise of the application and/or system.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves passing a malicious payload within the `sql_filter` parameter to the `findApplyedTasksPage` function in `BpmTaskMapper.xml`.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable `applyedList()` function and provide a crafted `sql_filter` payload. The specific position isn't explicitly stated, but it implies the attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application.

**Additional Details:**
* The affected product is J2EEFAST v2.7.0.
* The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability.
* The file `BpmTaskMapper.xml` is mentioned as part of the vulnerable functionality.
* A fix is available in J2EEFAST v2.7.0 (this is likely an error in the text, since the affected and fixed version are identical).
