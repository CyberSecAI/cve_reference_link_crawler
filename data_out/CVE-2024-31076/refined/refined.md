Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2024-31076**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition during CPU hotplug operations and interrupt affinity changes. When an interrupt's affinity is changed via procfs, the actual move of the interrupt to the new CPU is deferred until the next interrupt trigger on the *original* CPU. This process involves allocating a new interrupt vector on the target CPU while leaving the old vector on the original CPU active. The old vector is meant to be reclaimed later. However, if the original CPU goes offline before the interrupt is triggered again on the *new* CPU, the cleanup process for the old vector isn't properly triggered, resulting in a vector leak in the `vector_matrix`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** CPU going offline during a deferred interrupt move.
- **Improper resource cleanup:**  Failure to reclaim the old interrupt vector when the original CPU goes offline before the interrupt is triggered again on the new CPU.
- **Logic error:** The `irq_force_complete_move()` function, responsible for reclaiming the old vector, is not called when it should be during the outgoing CPU process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Resource exhaustion:** Unreclaimed interrupt vectors lead to a leak in the `vector_matrix`, potentially causing system instability or denial of service by depleting available vectors.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could trigger a combination of interrupt affinity changes and CPU hotplug operations.
- Specifically, triggering an interrupt move, and then quickly taking the original cpu offline.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify interrupt affinities via procfs.
- The attacker also needs to be able to take CPUs offline or trigger CPU hotplug events.
