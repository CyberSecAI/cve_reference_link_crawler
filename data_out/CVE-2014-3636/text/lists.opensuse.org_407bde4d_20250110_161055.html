An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)
