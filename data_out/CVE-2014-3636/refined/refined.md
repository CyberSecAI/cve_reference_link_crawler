Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3636:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient limits on the number of file descriptors (fds) that the D-Bus daemon (`dbus-daemon`) could handle, specifically related to file descriptor passing. The default configuration allowed a high number of fds to be queued per connection and a large number of fds to be attached to a message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Excessive FD Quota:** The `dbus-daemon` allowed a single user to create multiple connections and transmit a large number of file descriptors, exceeding the system's file descriptor limit.
2.  **Insufficient FD Limit:** The default `max_message_unix_fds` limit was too high, allowing a single user to exhaust the `dbus-daemon`'s available file descriptors.
3.  **Inconsistent FD Handling:** The `dbus-daemon` didn't consistently apply limits to file descriptors, potentially leading to `MSG_CTRUNC` errors when receiving messages with many file descriptors, causing disconnections.
4.  **Linux Specific Sendmsg Limit:** On Linux, there is a limit of 253 fds that can be sent in a single `sendmsg()` system call. The `dbus-daemon` didn't account for this, allowing a malicious client to construct messages that would cause `dbus-daemon` to disconnect the recipient due to an `EINVAL` error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**
    *   Local attackers could prevent new connections to `dbus-daemon`.
    *   Existing clients could be disconnected by exhausting file descriptor limits.
    *   The `dbus-daemon` could stop responding.
    *   System services could be disconnected.
    *   Reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
*   A malicious user could create multiple D-Bus connections to the system bus and send large numbers of file descriptors.
*   A malicious client could send specially crafted D-Bus messages with many fds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create D-Bus connections to `dbus-daemon`.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vulnerability was mitigated by reducing the default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message from 1024 to 16, and maximum of 64 fds on each connection.
*   Distributions on non-Linux may need to configure a smaller limit in `system.conf`, if their limit on the number of fds is smaller than Linux's.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability could be triggered by sending large number of file descriptor messages.
*   The issue is present in D-Bus versions >= 1.3.0.
*   The patch addresses multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2014-3635, CVE-2014-3637, CVE-2014-3638, and CVE-2014-3639.
