- An attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject malicious scripts into the notes field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site.
- **Access to Recipe Notes:** The attacker needs the ability to modify or create recipes and their notes within the plugin's interface.
