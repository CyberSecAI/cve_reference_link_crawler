Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Wagtail's `parse_query_string` function processes search queries. Specifically, the regular expression used to separate filters from the query string is susceptible to backtracking when processing long strings of characters without spaces. This results in a significant increase in processing time, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to inefficient regex.
- Inefficient processing of long search queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive processing time.
- The application becomes unresponsive when parsing maliciously crafted long query strings.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  By submitting long strings of characters without spaces through the search query functionality.
- This could potentially be done through the Wagtail admin panel or any custom implementation using the `parse_query_string` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted search query.
- For the initial Wagtail installation, this requires a Wagtail admin user account.
- In a custom search implementation using `parse_query_string`, it might be exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a word boundary (`\b`) to the beginning of the regular expression used for filter detection in `wagtail/search/utils.py`.
- This change prevents the regex engine from backtracking and drastically improves the performance of the query parsing function when dealing with long strings.
- The provided content includes the commit diffs showing the specific code changes related to the vulnerability fix.
- The vulnerability affects all unpatched versions of Wagtail from 2.0 onwards.
- Workarounds include limiting the length of search terms passed to the function.
- The advisory provides a CVSS score of 6.5, indicating a "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1333 (Regular expression ReDoS).
- The patched versions are Wagtail 5.2.6, 6.0.6, and 6.1.3.
