# Regular expression denial-of-service via search query parsing

Moderate

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-jmp3-39vp-fwg8
Jul 11, 2024

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 5.2.6, 6.0 - 6.0.5, 6.1 - 6.1.2

## Patched versions

5.2.6, 6.0.6, 6.1.3

## Description

### Impact

A bug in Wagtail's [`parse_query_string`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/search/searching.html#wagtailsearch-query-string-parsing) would result in it taking a long time to process suitably crafted inputs. When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service.

In an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users).

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 5.2.6, 6.0.6 and 6.1.3.

This vulnerability affects all unpatched versions from Wagtail 2.0 onwards.

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can limit the length of search terms passed to `parse_query_string`. Whilst the performance characteristics will depend on your hosting environment, 1000 characters has been shown to still be fairly fast, without triggering this vulnerability.

No workaround is available for the Wagtail admin usage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
