This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Require word boundaries before search query filters ([CVE-2024-39317](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jmp3-39vp-fwg8 "CVE-2024-39317"))

```
Requiring a word boundary before the start of a filter prevents backtracking, as substrings of the filter name are no longer valid filter names.

This also makes matching around an order of magnitude faster.
