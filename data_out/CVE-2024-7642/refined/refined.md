Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw that occurs because user-supplied data is directly used to construct a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `activate_act.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the data from the `id` parameter is passed to the `exec()` function, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code, which could lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data within the database.
    - **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing login mechanisms or impersonating other users.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some contexts, achieving code execution on the server via SQL injection.
    - **Denial of Service:**  Causing disruption of the application by manipulating database queries.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `id` GET parameter in the `activate_act.php` URL, allowing direct manipulation by crafting malicious URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- No authentication is specifically mentioned in the provided context as a prerequisite, which suggests that the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authorization.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload.
