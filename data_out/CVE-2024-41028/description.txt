In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access

In order to use toshiba_dmi_quirks[] together with the standard DMI
matching functions, it must be terminated by a empty entry.

Since this entry is missing, an array out-of-bounds access occurs
every time the quirk list is processed.

Fix this by adding the terminating empty entry.
