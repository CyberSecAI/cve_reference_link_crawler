Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2021-47612**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference occurs in `nfc_genl_dump_devices_done()` when `kmalloc` in `nfc_genl_dump_devices()` fails. In such a scenario, the `iter` pointer which is supposed to hold the iterator of class devices will be null. However, the code attempts to use the pointer without checking its validity first causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing null pointer check before dereferencing the `iter` pointer in `nfc_genl_dump_devices_done()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference), potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a situation where `kmalloc` fails in `nfc_genl_dump_devices()`, which can happen due to memory pressure or other resource exhaustion conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to interact with the NFC subsystem such that they can call `nfc_genl_dump_devices()`.
- The attacker needs to create a condition where `kmalloc` fails in the mentioned function.
