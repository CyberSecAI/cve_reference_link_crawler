Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3604-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u11
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-24165 CVE-2023-0330 CVE-2023-3180
Debian Bug     : 1029155

Multiple issues were discovered in qemu, a fast processor emulator.

CVE-2020-24165

    A use-after-free race in the code generator could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-0330

    A DMA-MMIO reentrancy problem in the lsi53c895a device may lead to
    memory corruption bugs, such as stack overflow or use-after-free.

CVE-2023-3180

    The function virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper, part of the implementation
    of qemu's virtual crypto device, did not check that the values of
    'src_len' and 'dst_len' are the same.  This could lead to a heap
    buffer overflow.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2222424#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-12 17:20:02 UTC  ``` A heap buffer overflow was found in virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper() in hw/virtio/virtio-crypto.c. It could occur while handling data encryption/dencryption requests in virtio_crypto_handle_sym_req(). There is no check for the value of the src_len and the dst_len in virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper(), so if src_len is not equal to dst_len, a heap based buff overflow occurs while encrypting/dencrypting the data.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2222424#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-08-03 07:17:52 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-08/msg00401.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2222424#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-08-03 07:18:12 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2228748](show_bug.cgi?id=2228748 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-3180 qemu: virtio-crypto: heap buffer overflow in virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2222424#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-08-03 13:05:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
