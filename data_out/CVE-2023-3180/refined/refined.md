Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-3180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper` function within QEMU's virtual crypto device implementation. This function doesn't verify if the source length (`src_len`) and destination length (`dst_len`) are the same before processing encryption/decryption requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:**  When `src_len` and `dst_len` differ, the `virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper` function can write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap during encryption or decryption operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Memory corruption:** May lead to memory corruption bugs, including stack overflow or use-after-free situations

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the QEMU virtual crypto device, specifically by sending crafted encryption or decryption requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to interact with a virtual machine configured to use the vulnerable QEMU virtual crypto device. This could potentially be a local user within the guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the values of src_len and dst_len passed to the function.
