Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u11
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-24165 CVE-2023-0330 CVE-2023-3180
Debian Bug     : 1029155

Multiple issues were discovered in qemu, a fast processor emulator.

CVE-2020-24165

    A use-after-free race in the code generator could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-0330

    A DMA-MMIO reentrancy problem in the lsi53c895a device may lead to
    memory corruption bugs, such as stack overflow or use-after-free.

CVE-2023-3180

    The function virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper, part of the implementation
    of qemu's virtual crypto device, did not check that the values of
    'src_len' and 'dst_len' are the same.  This could lead to a heap
    buffer overflow.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
