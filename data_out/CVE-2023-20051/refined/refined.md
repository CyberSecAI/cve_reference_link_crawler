- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the Vector Packet Processor (VPP) improperly handling a malformed packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed packets in VPP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could stop ICMP traffic over an IPsec connection, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a malformed Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packet over an IPsec connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send packets over an IPsec connection. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
