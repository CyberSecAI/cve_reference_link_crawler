Chunghwa Telecom NOKIA G-040W-Q has a vulnerability of authentication bypass, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism to log in to the device by an alternative URL. This makes it possible for unauthenticated remote attackers to log in as any existing users, such as an administrator, to perform arbitrary system operations or disrupt service.
