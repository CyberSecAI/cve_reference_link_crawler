Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `CartsGuruCatalogModuleFrontController::display()` method and the `controllers14/catalog.php` ajax script in the "Marketing automation multicanal" (cartsguru) module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `$limit` and `$offset` variables, which control the number of results returned by database queries, are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The lack of proper sanitization of the `$limit` and `$offset` variables allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries. The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 2.4.2. Even if updated to later versions, the files from older versions were not deleted, leaving some installations vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Critical Impact:** The vulnerability is rated as critical (9.8) due to the high potential impact.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** It can lead to obtaining admin access by exploiting the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can remove or modify data, including critical shop settings
*   **Account Takeover:** The vulnerability can be leveraged to copy and paste data from sensitive tables to the front-end, potentially exposing tokens and enabling unauthorized access to admin AJAX scripts. It could also enable the attacker to rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
*   **Webskimmer Deployment:** The vulnerability is actively being exploited to deploy webskimmers that steal credit card data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is the network, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP Request:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by making malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable controllers (`controllers14/catalog.php` and `front/catalog.php`).
*  **Concealed Exploitation:** Attackers can conceal the module controller's path, making it difficult to detect the exploit using conventional frontend logs. The logs will show only “POST /” requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploitation.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints within the module.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the files `controllers14/catalog.php` and `controllers/front/catalog.php`.
*   The fix involves casting the `$limit` and `$offset` variables to integers: `$sql .= ' LIMIT ' . (int) $limit . ' OFFSET ' . (int) $offset;`.
*   The module author did not initially auto-delete vulnerable files during updates. This means that even users who had updated their modules could still be vulnerable if they had older versions of the files.
*   The exploit is being actively used to deploy webskimmers for stealing credit card information.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest module version and also suggests further security improvements, such as changing the default database prefix.
*   The exploit uses a front controller which can conceal the module path in logs.
*   The exploit can be detected using mod_security with AuditEngine active.
