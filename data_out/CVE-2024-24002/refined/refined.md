Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24002:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of the `column` and `order` parameters within the `com.jsh.erp.controller.MaterialController: com.jsh.erp.utils.BaseResponseInfo getListWithStock()` function of jshERP v3.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application uses a `safeSqlParse` method intended to prevent SQL injection, but this method can be bypassed by crafting specific payloads that circumvent the filtering mechanism. The filtering logic is flawed and can be bypassed using techniques like using doubled keywords such as "andnd" and "selectelect"

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, as well as potential denial-of-service attacks through resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to specific endpoints, e.g. `/jshERP-boot/material/getListWithStock`, `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutDetail`, `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutMaterialCount`, `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findAllocationDetail`.
- By manipulating the `column` and `order` parameters within the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned, but the provided examples show the `X-Access-Token` header, suggesting some form of authorization is likely required.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter names (`column`, `order`) and the application's endpoint structure.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads that bypass the application's `safeSqlParse` method.
- The vulnerability is exposed over the web, so anyone with network access to the vulnerable application can attempt to exploit it.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The provided content also mentions a file upload vulnerability but that is not related to the current CVE.
- Several SQL injection Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) are provided, demonstrating how the `safeSqlParse` method can be circumvented, these are for the following endpoints:
  - `/jshERP-boot/material/getListWithStock`
  - `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutDetail`
  - `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutMaterialCount`
  - `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findAllocationDetail`
- The vulnerable application uses a custom filtering method (`safeSqlParse`) which attempts to remove SQL keywords but is not robust enough to prevent injection.
