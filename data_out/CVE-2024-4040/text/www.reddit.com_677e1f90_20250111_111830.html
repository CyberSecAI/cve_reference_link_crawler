# All versions of Crush FTP are vulnerable

[New Vulnerability Disclosure](/r/cybersecurity/?f=flair_name%3A%22New%20Vulnerability%20Disclosure%22)

Saw this hasn't hit the hacker news or anything else yet, but received this notification from CrushFTP Support directly via a mass mailing.

> Please take immediate action to patch ASAP. A vulnerability was reported today (April 19th, 2024), and we patched it immediately. v10 version 10.71 is patched. v11 version 11.1.0 is patched. This vulnerability exists in the wild.

> The bottom line of this vulnerability is that any unauthenticated or authenticated user via the WebInterface could retrieve system files that are not part of their VFS. This could lead to escalation as they learn more, etc.

> If you are still on CrushFTP v9, you need to upgrade to v11 immediately! Otherwise perform an update directly in your CrushFTP dashboard,

> Updating CrushFTP is \*simple\*. There is a simple rollback in case you have an issue or regression with some functionality. Update immediately!
