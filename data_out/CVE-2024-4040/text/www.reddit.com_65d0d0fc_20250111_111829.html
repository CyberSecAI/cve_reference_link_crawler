# SITUATIONAL AWARENESS // 2024-04-19 // CrushFTP Virtual Filesystem Escape Vulnerability in the Wild

[Emerging](/r/crowdstrike/?f=flair_name%3A%22Emerging%22)

**What Happened?**

On April 19, 2024, CrushFTP advised of a virtual file system escape present in their FTP software that could allows users to download system files. Falcon OverWatch and Falcon Intelligence have observed this exploit being used in the wild in a targeted fashion. At time of writing, the entire vendor disclosure is:

> CrushFTP v11 versions below 11.1 have a vulnerability where users can escape their VFS and download system files. This has been patched in v11.1.0. Customers using a DMZ in front of their main CrushFTP instance are protected with its protocol translation system it utilizes. (CREDIT:Simon Garrelou, of Airbus CERT)

and can be found [here](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update). Release notes for the patched version of CrushFTP v11.1 can be found [here](https://crushftp.com/version11_build.html).

There is no CVE issued at this time.

CrushFTP users should continue to follow the vendor's website for the most up-to-date instructions and prioritize patching.

**Falcon Counter Adversary Operations (CAO)**

Falcon CAO customers can read the following finished intelligence report for additional details on tactics, techniques, objectives, and attribution:

*CSA-240466 Targeted Intrusion Actor Exploits CrushFTP Servers at Multiple U.S. Entities; Intelligence-Gathering Activity Possibly Politically Motivated*

**Responding with Falcon**

Falcon Insight XDR customers can use the following query to hunt for CrushFTP executions in their environment:

```

#event_simpleName=/^(PeFileWritten|PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ ImageFileName=/crushftp/i
| ImageFileName=/(\\Device\\HarddiskVolume\d+)?(?<ShortIFN>.+$)/
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], function=([selectFromMax(field="@timestamp", include=[aip, LocalAddressIP4, ShortIFN])]))
| ipLocation(aip)
| drop([aip.lat, aip.lon])
| join(query={#repo=sensor_metadata #data_source_name=aidmaster #data_source_group=aidmaster-api}, field=[aid], mode=left, include=[Version, AgentVersion, ProductType])
| $falcon/helper:enrich(field=ProductType)
```

CQL

The application is bundled as a stand-alone portable executable that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and has a dependency on Java. CrushFTP may not have a standard installation location.

Falcon Exposure Management customers can navigate to "Applications" and search for "CrushFTP"

Falcon Counter Adversary Operations customers can navigate to "External attack surface explore" to locate CrushFTP systems that are internet facing with the following query:

```

platform.vendor equals 'CrushFTP'
```

Individual record.

Falcon for IT customers can use the following osQuery search to probe for the presence of CrushFTP in shimcache:

```

SELECT entry AS execution_order, path, DATETIME(modified_time, 'unixepoch') AS file_last_modified, uptime.days || ' days, ' || uptime.hours || ' hours' AS host_uptime FROM shimcache CROSS JOIN uptime WHERE path LIKE '%crushftp%';
```

**Conclusion**

Thanks to [r/CrowdStrike](/r/CrowdStrike/) member [u/dawson33944](/user/dawson33944/) for [posting the communication sent to customer by CrushFTP](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1c850i2/all_versions_of_crush_ftp_are_vulnerable/).
