![CrushFTP](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/04/19/CrushFTP_headpic.jpg)

***Update April 22, 16:31 EDT:* This CrushFTP VFS sandbox escape vulnerability is now tracked as [CVE-2024-4040](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4040).**

CrushFTP warned customers today in a private memo of an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability fixed in new versions released today, urging them to patch their servers immediately.

As the company also explains in a [public security advisory](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update) published on Friday, this zero-day bug enables unauthenticated attackers to escape the user's virtual file system (VFS) and download system files.

However, those using a DMZ (demilitarized zone) perimeter network in front of their main CrushFTP instance are protected against attacks.

"Please take immediate action to patch ASAP. A vulnerability was reported today (April 19th, 2024), and we patched it immediately. [..] This vulnerability exists in the wild," the company warned customers via email.

"The bottom line of this vulnerability is that any unauthenticated or authenticated user via the WebInterface could retrieve system files that are not part of their VFS. This could lead to escalation as they learn more, etc."

The company also warned customers with servers still running CrushFTP v9 to immediately upgrade to v11 or update their instance via the dashboard.

"There is a simple rollback in case you have an issue or regression with some functionality. Update immediately," CrushFTP warned.

The security flaw was reported by Simon Garrelou of Airbus CERT and is now fixed in CrushFTP versions 10.7.1 and 11.1.0.

According to Shodan, at least 2,700 CrushFTP instances have their web interface exposed online to attacks, although it's impossible to determine how many have yet to be patched.

![Internet-exposed CrushFTP instances](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2024/Internet_exposed_CrushFTP_instances.jpg)

## Exploited in targeted attacks

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike also confirmed the vulnerability (which has yet to get a CVE ID assigned) in an intelligence report with more information on the attackers' tactics, techniques, and objectives (TTPs).

CrowdStrike says its Falcon OverWatch and Falcon Intelligence teams have seen the CrushFTP zero-days being exploited in targeted attacks.

The threat actors are targeting CrushFTP servers at multiple U.S. organizations, and evidence points to an intelligence-gathering campaign, likely politically motivated.

"Falcon OverWatch and Falcon Intelligence have observed this exploit being used in the wild in a targeted fashion," CrowdStrike [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1c88788/situational_awareness_20240419_crushftp_virtual/).

"CrushFTP users should continue to follow the vendor's website for the most up-to-date instructions and prioritize patching."

In November, CrushFTP customers were also warned to patch a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2023-43177) after Converge security researchers who reported the flaw also [released a proof-of-concept exploit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploit-for-crushftp-rce-chain-released-patch-now/).

## **Update Bug on Windows**[#](#section-Update-UpdateBugOnWindows)

Some versions of CrushFTP had a problem applying an update automatically. They would fail to rename ".jar" files on Windows operating systems. They would instead leave behind ".jar\_tmp" files needing the "\_tmp" manually removed from them. This has been fixed for a while, but if you are still on one of these older builds, you will be affected the next time you attempt the update. So you need to fix the jar filenames one time manually. Example: CrushFTP.jar\_tmp -> CrushFTP.jar. Same for all other jars in plugins, plugins/lib folder, and the WebInterface folder has CrushTunnel.jar. Do all 3 locations entirely.

### Vulnerability Info[#](#section-Update-VulnerabilityInfo)

**November 11th, 2024 - (CVE-2024-53552 - CREDIT: Stratascale Cyber Research Unit)**

V10 versions below 10.8.3 and V11 versions below 11.2.3 are vulnerable to a password reset email exploit. If an end user clicks the link, their account is compromised.

Once you update you must configure your allowed email reset URL domains.

v10:Preferences, WebInterface, MiniURL: Set an allowed list of domains, comma separated.

v11:Preferneces, WebInterface, Login Page: Set a domain pattern that is not just '\*' as a '\*' is no longer allowed.

October 10, 2024 - (CVE-2024-11986 credit European Commission, Application Security Testing Services)

XSS bug fixed in CrushFTP 10.8.2 and 11.2.1.

---

April 19th, 2024 - (CVE-2024-4040)

CrushFTP v11 versions below 11.1 have a vulnerability where users can escape their VFS and download system files. This has been patched in v11.1.0. Customers using a [DMZ](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=DMZ) in front of their main CrushFTP instance are partially protected with its protocol translation system it utilizes. A DMZ however does not fully protect you and you must update immediately. (CREDIT:Simon Garrelou, of Airbus CERT)

### FAQ:[#](#section-Update-FAQ)

•If I'm on v10.8.3+...do I need to upgrade to v11? No, 10.8.3+ are safe.

•If I'm on v10.6.1, or v10.3, or v10.5.5, am I vulnerable? Yes! Update immediately to 10.8.3+ or v11.2.3+.

#### Installing an offline update when the server cannot reach our server over the internet directly:[#](#section-Update-InstallingAnOfflineUpdateWhenTheServerCannotReachOurServerOverTheInternetDirectly)

1.) Download CrushFTP11.zip from our download page. (<https://www.crushftp.com/early11/CrushFTP11.zip>![](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/images/out.png))

2.) Give it the specific name `CrushFTP11\_new.zip` and place this in the CrushFTP main folder. (Same location where you have your CrushFTP.jar file)

3.) See above normal instructions as Crush will use your local offline zip file.

#### Fully manual offline update:[#](#section-Update-FullyManualOfflineUpdate)

In some rare scenarios when neither of the above methods work, like file permissions prevent consuming the update file or overwriting the necessary components by the updater. In such case:
1.) Download CrushFTP11.zip from our download page. (<https://www.crushftp.com/early11/CrushFTP11.zip>![](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/images/out.png))

2.) Unzip it to a temporary directory

3.) Stop the CrushFTP service
4.) Copy over the installation the full content or just the **CrushFTP.jar** file and the **plugins and WebInterface** subdirectories as these are. Overwrite all when prompted.

5.) Start the Crush service. Once back on line, clear the browser cache or check with an incognito/private browser session.

---

#### How to restore a backup in the event of some issue or regression in functionality:[#](#section-Update-HowToRestoreABackupInTheEventOfSomeIssueOrRegressionInFunctionality)

(CrushFTP automatically creates a backup of its core files in the CrushFTP folder, backup folder.)

1.) Restore the CrushFTP.jar file.

2.) Restore the plugins folder.

3.) Restore the WebInterface folder...mainly the CrushTunnel.jar file from inside it.

# Unauthenticated CrushFTP Zero-Day Enables Complete Server Compromise

* Apr 23, 2024
* 3 min read
* [Caitlin Condon](/blog/author/caitlin-condon/)

*Last updated at Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:21:19 GMT*

*Rapid7 vulnerability researcher Ryan Emmons contributed to this blog.*

On Friday, April 19, 2024, managed file transfer vendor CrushFTP [released information](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crushftp-warns-users-to-patch-exploited-zero-day-immediately/) to a private mailing list on a new [zero-day vulnerability](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/zero-day-attack/) affecting versions below 10.7.1 and 11.1.0 (as well as legacy 9.x versions) across all platforms. No CVE was assigned by the vendor, but a third-party CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) assigned [CVE-2024-4040](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4040) as of Monday, April 22. According to a public-facing [vendor advisory](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update), the vulnerability is ostensibly a VFS sandbox escape in CrushFTP managed file transfer software that allows “remote attackers with low privileges to read files from the filesystem outside of VFS Sandbox.”

Rapid7’s vulnerability research team [analyzed CVE-2024-4040](https://attackerkb.com/topics/20oYjlmfXa/cve-2024-4040/rapid7-analysis) and determined that it is **fully unauthenticated** and trivially exploitable; successful exploitation allows for not only arbitrary file read as root, but also authentication bypass for administrator account access and full remote code execution. Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to access and potentially exfiltrate all files stored on the CrushFTP instance. See Rapid7's full [technical analysis of CVE-2024-4040](https://attackerkb.com/topics/20oYjlmfXa/cve-2024-4040/rapid7-analysis) in AttackerKB for additional details.

Code that triggers the vulnerability is [publicly available](https://github.com/airbus-cert/CVE-2024-4040/blob/main/README.md) as of April 23. CVE-2024-4040 was added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list [on April 24](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

Although the vulnerability has been formally described as an arbitrary file read, Rapid7 believes that it can be more accurately categorized as a server-side template injection (SSTI). CVE-2024-4040 was exploited in the wild as a zero-day vulnerability, per private customer communications from the vendor and a [public Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1c88788/situational_awareness_20240419_crushftp_virtual/) from security firm CrowdStrike. Using a query that looks for a specific JavaScript file in the web interface, there appear to be roughly [5,200 instances](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=html%3A%22%2FWebInterface%2FResources%2Fjs%2Flogin.js%22) of CrushFTP exposed to the public internet.

## Mitigation guidance

According to the [advisory](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update), CrushFTP versions **below 11.1** are vulnerable to CVE-2024-4040. The following versions of CrushFTP are vulnerable as of April 23:

* All legacy CrushFTP 9 installations
* CrushFTP 10 before v10.7.1
* CrushFTP 11 before v11.1.0

The vulnerability has been patched in version 11.1.0 for the 11.x version stream, and in version 10.7.1 for the 10.x version stream. Our research team has validated that the vendor-supplied patch effectively remediates CVE-2024-4040.

The vendor advisory emphasizes the importance of updating to a fixed version of CrushFTP on an urgent basis. Rapid7 echoes this guidance, particularly given our team’s findings on the true impact of the issue, and urges organizations to apply the vendor-supplied patch on an emergency basis, without waiting for a typical patch cycle to occur.

While the vendor guidance as of April 22 says that “customers using a [DMZ](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=DMZ) in front of their main CrushFTP instance are partially protected,” it’s unclear whether this is actually an effective barrier to exploitation. Out of an abundance of caution, Rapid7 advises against relying on a DMZ as a mitigation strategy.

## Detection challenges

During the course of vulnerability analysis, Rapid7 observed several factors that make it difficult to effectively detect exploitation of CVE-2024-4040. Payloads for CVE-2024-4040 can be delivered in many different forms. When certain evasive techniques are leveraged, payloads will be redacted from logs and request history, and malicious requests will be difficult to discern from legitimate traffic. CrushFTP instances behind a standard reverse proxy, such as NGINX or Apache, are partially defended against these techniques, but our team has found that evasive tactics are still possible.

CrushFTP customers can harden their servers against administrator-level remote code execution attacks by enabling [Limited Server mode](https://www.crushftp.com/crush10wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Limited%20Server) with the most restrictive configuration possible. Organizations should also use firewalls wherever possible to aggressively restrict which IP addresses are permitted to access CrushFTP services.

## Rapid7 customers

InsightVM and Nexpose customers can assess their exposure to CVE-2024-4040 with an authenticated vulnerability check available for UNIX-based systems in the April 24 content release. Customers can also use Query Builder (asset.software.product CONTAINS 'CrushFTP') or a Filtered Asset Search (Software Name contains CrushFTP) to find assets in their environment with CrushFTP installed.

InsightIDR and managed detection and response (MDR) customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7's expansive library of detection rules. Rapid7 recommends installing the Insight Agent on all applicable hosts to ensure visibility into suspicious processes and proper detection coverage. Below is a non-exhaustive list of detections that are deployed and will alert on post-exploitation behavior related to this zero-day vulnerability for both InsightIDR and Rapid7 MDR customers:

* Suspicious Web Request - Possible CrushFTP (CVE-2024-4040) Exploitation

## Updates

**April 23, 2024:** Added `Detection challenges` section. Noted that our team tested the vendor-supplied patch and found that it successfully remediates CVE-2024-4040. Added detection rule deployed and alerting for InsightIDR and Rapid7 MDR customers. Added Query Builder information to assist InsightVM and Nexpose customers in identifying CrushFTP installations in their environments. Added link to Airbus CERT [proof-of-concept code](https://github.com/airbus-cert/CVE-2024-4040/blob/main/README.md).

**April 24, 2024:** CVE-2024-4040 has been added to [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog). A vulnerability check is now available to InsightVM and Nexpose customers. Rapid7's full technical analysis of CVE-2024-4040 is [now available in AttackerKB](https://attackerkb.com/topics/20oYjlmfXa/cve-2024-4040/rapid7-analysis).

# CVE-2024-4040 - exploit scanners

This repository contains files related to [CVE-2024-4040](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4040) (CrushFTP VFS escape).

## scan\_host.py

This script attempts to use the vulnerability to read files outside the sandbox. If it succeeds, the script writes `Vulnerable` to standard output and returns with exit code 1. If exploiting the vulnerability does not succeed, the script writes `Not vulnerable` and exits with status code 0.

The script depends on the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

## scan\_logs.py

This script looks for indicators of compromise in a CrushFTP server installation directory. It is basically equivalent to running the following command:

```
$ grep -F -r '<INCLUDE>' /path/to/CrushFTP/logs/

```

For each match, it will attempt to extract the IP which tried to exploit the server.

# All versions of Crush FTP are vulnerable

[New Vulnerability Disclosure](/r/cybersecurity/?f=flair_name%3A%22New%20Vulnerability%20Disclosure%22)

Saw this hasn't hit the hacker news or anything else yet, but received this notification from CrushFTP Support directly via a mass mailing.

> Please take immediate action to patch ASAP. A vulnerability was reported today (April 19th, 2024), and we patched it immediately. v10 version 10.71 is patched. v11 version 11.1.0 is patched. This vulnerability exists in the wild.

> The bottom line of this vulnerability is that any unauthenticated or authenticated user via the WebInterface could retrieve system files that are not part of their VFS. This could lead to escalation as they learn more, etc.

> If you are still on CrushFTP v9, you need to upgrade to v11 immediately! Otherwise perform an update directly in your CrushFTP dashboard,

> Updating CrushFTP is \*simple\*. There is a simple rollback in case you have an issue or regression with some functionality. Update immediately!

# SITUATIONAL AWARENESS // 2024-04-19 // CrushFTP Virtual Filesystem Escape Vulnerability in the Wild

[Emerging](/r/crowdstrike/?f=flair_name%3A%22Emerging%22)

**What Happened?**

On April 19, 2024, CrushFTP advised of a virtual file system escape present in their FTP software that could allows users to download system files. Falcon OverWatch and Falcon Intelligence have observed this exploit being used in the wild in a targeted fashion. At time of writing, the entire vendor disclosure is:

> CrushFTP v11 versions below 11.1 have a vulnerability where users can escape their VFS and download system files. This has been patched in v11.1.0. Customers using a DMZ in front of their main CrushFTP instance are protected with its protocol translation system it utilizes. (CREDIT:Simon Garrelou, of Airbus CERT)

and can be found [here](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update). Release notes for the patched version of CrushFTP v11.1 can be found [here](https://crushftp.com/version11_build.html).

There is no CVE issued at this time.

CrushFTP users should continue to follow the vendor's website for the most up-to-date instructions and prioritize patching.

**Falcon Counter Adversary Operations (CAO)**

Falcon CAO customers can read the following finished intelligence report for additional details on tactics, techniques, objectives, and attribution:

*CSA-240466 Targeted Intrusion Actor Exploits CrushFTP Servers at Multiple U.S. Entities; Intelligence-Gathering Activity Possibly Politically Motivated*

**Responding with Falcon**

Falcon Insight XDR customers can use the following query to hunt for CrushFTP executions in their environment:

```

#event_simpleName=/^(PeFileWritten|PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ ImageFileName=/crushftp/i
| ImageFileName=/(\\Device\\HarddiskVolume\d+)?(?<ShortIFN>.+$)/
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], function=([selectFromMax(field="@timestamp", include=[aip, LocalAddressIP4, ShortIFN])]))
| ipLocation(aip)
| drop([aip.lat, aip.lon])
| join(query={#repo=sensor_metadata #data_source_name=aidmaster #data_source_group=aidmaster-api}, field=[aid], mode=left, include=[Version, AgentVersion, ProductType])

CQL

The application is bundled as a stand-alone portable executable that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and has a dependency on Java. CrushFTP may not have a standard installation location.

Falcon Exposure Management customers can navigate to "Applications" and search for "CrushFTP"

Falcon Counter Adversary Operations customers can navigate to "External attack surface explore" to locate CrushFTP systems that are internet facing with the following query:

```

platform.vendor equals 'CrushFTP'
```

Individual record.

Falcon for IT customers can use the following osQuery search to probe for the presence of CrushFTP in shimcache:

```

SELECT entry AS execution_order, path, DATETIME(modified_time, 'unixepoch') AS file_last_modified, uptime.days || ' days, ' || uptime.hours || ' hours' AS host_uptime FROM shimcache CROSS JOIN uptime WHERE path LIKE '%crushftp%';
```

**Conclusion**

Thanks to [r/CrowdStrike](/r/CrowdStrike/) member [u/dawson33944](/user/dawson33944/) for [posting the communication sent to customer by CrushFTP](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1c850i2/all_versions_of_crush_ftp_are_vulnerable/).

### REGARDING THE RECENT VULNERABILITY ANNOUNCEMENT NOVEMBER 16, 2023![#](#section-Update-REGARDINGTHERECENTVULNERABILITYANNOUNCEMENTNOVEMBER162023)

If your CrushFTP is lower than 10.5.5, you are vulnerable to an exploit that was responsibly disclosed. It is not known to be in he wild, but its severe and everyone must update immediately. All versions of CrushFTP...v4/v5/v6/v7/v8/v9/v10 were affected by this. CrushFTP v11 is not affected by this as it has been patched before its first public release. One part of the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access simply by knowing the admin username, and the other parts when used together allows an attacker who has a non privileged account to gain access to files outside their VFS which can then be in turn used to login as a more privileged user. CVE release is pending. Credit goes to the UK NCSC.

### REGARDING THE RECENT VULNERABILITY ANNOUNCEMENT AUGUST 10, 2023! (CVE-2023-43177)[#](#section-Update-REGARDINGTHERECENTVULNERABILITYANNOUNCEMENTAUGUST102023CVE202343177)

If your CrushFTP version is less then 10.5.1, you are vulnerable. No exception. Look at your version number on the dashboard, and it must be 10.5.1 or higher to be safe. For reference, v6, v7, v8,v9...those numbers are less than v10.5.1. Yes, they are vulnerable! Anything below 10.5.1 is vulnerable.

This vulnerability is critical because it does NOT require any authentication. It can be done anonymously and steal the session of other users and escalate to an administrator user. Its critical everyone updates ASAP! 10.5.2 changes other defaults related to loading DB drivers that are not in your classpath has also changed. This means if your DB drivers are not part of your plugins/lib folder, they will not be loaded by CrushFTP. (Statistics DB if you changed it, SQL Users if you are using that, etc.)

**IMPORTANT: due to the security updates since CrushFTP version 10.5.2+ any JDBC driver jar file needs to be placed into the CrushFTP10/plugins/lib/ directory, or it won't load. In case of a server previously configured using an external SQL user DB, this new feature prevents access on next launch, will need to move the jar file, then edit prefs.XML, update the <db\_driver> key value like**
```
<db_driver>./mssql-jdbc-12.4.0.jre11.jar</db_driver>
```

### Updating CrushFTP v10[#](#section-Update-UpdatingCrushFTPV10)

#### How to update CrushFTP within the same major version number:[#](#section-Update-HowToUpdateCrushFTPWithinTheSameMajorVersionNumber)

1.) Login to the dashboard using your "crushadmin" equivalent user in the WebInterface.

2.) Click on the about tab.

3.) Click Update, Update Now.

4.) Wait roughly 5 minutes for the files to download, unzip, and be copied in place. CrushFTP will auto restart once done.

5.) Finished.

|  |
| --- |

#### Installing an offline update when the server cannot reach our server over the internet directly:[#](#section-Update-InstallingAnOfflineUpdateWhenTheServerCannotReachOurServerOverTheInternetDirectly)

1.) Download CrushFTP10.zip from our download page. (<https://www.crushftp.com/early10/CrushFTP10.zip>![](https://www.crushftp.com/crush10wiki/images/out.png))

2.) Give it the specific name `CrushFTP10\_new.zip` and place this in the CrushFTP main folder. (Same location where you have your CrushFTP.jar file)

3.) See above normal instructions as Crush will use your local offline zip file.

#### Fully manual offline update:[#](#section-Update-FullyManualOfflineUpdate)

In some rare scenarios when neither of the above methods work, like file permissions prevent consuming the update file or overwriting the necessary components by the updater. In such case:
1.) Download CrushFTP11.zip from our download page. (<https://www.crushftp.com/early10/CrushFTP10.zip>![](https://www.crushftp.com/crush10wiki/images/out.png))

2.) Unzip it to a temporary directory

3.) Stop the CrushFTP service

4.) Copy over the installation the full content or just the **CrushFTP.jar** file and the **plugins and WebInterface** subdirectories as these are. Overwrite all when prompted.

5.) Start the Crush service. Once back on line, clear the browser cache or check with an incognito/private browser session.

---

#### How to restore a backup in the event of some issue or regression in functionality:[#](#section-Update-HowToRestoreABackupInTheEventOfSomeIssueOrRegressionInFunctionality)

(CrushFTP automatically creates a backup of its core files in the CrushFTP folder, backup folder.)

1.) Restore the CrushFTP.jar file.

2.) Restore the plugins folder.

3.) Restore the WebInterface folder...mainly the CrushTunnel.jar file from inside it.

#### Changelog: <https://www.crushftp.com/version10_build.html>[#](#section-Update-ChangelogHttpsWww.crushftp.comVersion10_build.html)
