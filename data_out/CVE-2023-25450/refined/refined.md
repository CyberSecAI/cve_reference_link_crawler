- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GiveWP plugin (versions <= 2.25.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability. The plugin does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, resulting in actions being performed without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need to have direct access to the vulnerable website.
