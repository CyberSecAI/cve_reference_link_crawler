Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The provided documents indicate that CVE-2017-3461 is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in security updates for MySQL. However, the documents do not provide a specific root cause explanation for this particular CVE. Instead, they list it among a series of vulnerabilities related to "Server: Security: Privileges unspecified vulnerability" in the Red Hat advisory and within a general set of issues fixed in the Debian security update.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness associated with CVE-2017-3461 is a "Privileges unspecified vulnerability". This indicates a flaw in how MySQL manages or enforces user privileges, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions within the database.
*   The lack of specificity regarding the flaw means it could potentially stem from various issues such as incorrect access control checks, inadequate permission handling, or flawed privilege assignment logic within MySQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Since it's a "Privileges unspecified vulnerability", the impact could vary depending on the specific flaw.
*   The exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   An attacker could gain elevated privileges within the database, allowing them to perform administrative tasks or compromise the integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The document doesn't specify the attack vector for CVE-2017-3461 specifically.
*   Generally, an attacker would likely require access to the MySQL server and the ability to interact with it using SQL commands. The specifics of how they leverage the "unspecified privileges vulnerability" are not available but would need to be within the context of the database's functionalities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   To exploit CVE-2017-3461, an attacker would likely need some level of access to the MySQL server.
*   They might need to have a legitimate database user account, or be able to connect to the server directly if the server configuration has vulnerabilities that may allow that.
*   The specific capabilities required to trigger the flaw would depend on the exact nature of the privilege-related vulnerability which is unspecified in the document.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents address CVE-2017-3461 as part of a broader set of security updates that cover multiple vulnerabilities.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:2886 and RHSA-2017:2787, along with the Debian Security Advisory DSA-3834-1, recommend upgrading the respective MySQL packages to mitigate this and other identified vulnerabilities.
*   The provided information does not go into the technical details of this specific vulnerability but it is clear that it is a security related issue.

**In summary:**

CVE-2017-3461 is a "Privileges unspecified vulnerability" in MySQL that allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access or elevated privileges. Specifics regarding the root cause, exact attack vector, and required capabilities are not provided in the documents but are within the context of MySQL's security model.
