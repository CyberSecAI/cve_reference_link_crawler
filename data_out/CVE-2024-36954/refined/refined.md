Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36954:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `tipc_buf_append` function within the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module. Specifically, the `__skb_linearize()` function, which is used to ensure that a socket buffer (skb) is in a contiguous memory region, does not free the skb if it fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is that the code sets the `*buf` pointer to NULL *before* calling `__skb_linearize()`. Thus, on a failure during linearization, the skb is not freed which can result in a memory leak. This occurs when `skb_has_frag_list(frag)` is true but `__skb_linearize(frag)` fails to linearize the skb data into a single contiguous chunk.
- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The error handling logic in `tipc_buf_append` was flawed because it did not consider the fact that `__skb_linearize` could fail and leave an skb unfreed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Repeated memory leaks could lead to memory exhaustion and denial of service as the system runs out of available memory. This would negatively affect other processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable code path in `tipc_buf_append` with a fragmented skb that fails to linearize using `__skb_linearize()`. This likely involves crafting a malicious TIPC message with specific characteristics which will cause the head skb to have a fragment list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send TIPC messages to the vulnerable system to trigger the memory leak. This could be either a local attacker or potentially a remote attacker if the system is exposed to a network where TIPC is used.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix is a simple reordering of the statement `*buf = NULL` to occur *after* the call to `__skb_linearize()`. The correct code sequence is:
```c
    if (unlikely(head))
        goto err;
    frag = skb_unshare(frag, GFP_ATOMIC);
    if (unlikely(!frag))
        goto err;
    *buf = NULL; // Moved to after __skb_linearize and skb_unshare
    if (skb_has_frag_list(frag) && __skb_linearize(frag))
        goto err;
```
By setting `*buf` to NULL after the call, the skb can be freed in the error handling path, thus avoiding the memory leak. The `skb_unshare()` function was added to handle the case where the current fragment is shared.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes multiple commits addressing the same memory leak issue in different kernel versions and branches.
- The fix is present in the upstream commit `97bf6f81b29a8efaf5d0983251a7450e5794370d`, and various backports into stable kernel trees.
- Several Debian LTS advisories (DLA-3843-1 and DLA-3840-1) list this CVE as being addressed in their respective updates, indicating that multiple kernel versions were affected.
