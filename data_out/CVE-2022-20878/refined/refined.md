- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities including buffer overflows (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77) exist in the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with *root*-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.
