{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how nf_tables handles set element timeouts during control plane transactions. Previously, the system used the current time to check if a set element had expired, even during transactions that modify the set. This could lead to elements expiring prematurely if a control plane transaction took longer than the element's timeout.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect timeout check during control plane transactions.",
       "Use of current time instead of transaction timestamp."
    ],
    "impact": "Elements in nf_tables sets could expire prematurely, disrupting firewall rules and potentially leading to unexpected network behavior. This could affect services relying on these sets.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker does not directly exploit this vulnerability, however it could cause issues if the attacker sets a timeout on a table which they control and they are also responsible for a control plane transaction on that same table.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger a control plane transaction on nf_tables sets."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The fix introduces a timestamp field at the beginning of each transaction, stored in the nftables per-netns area. The set backend operations (.insert, .deactivate, sync gc) use this timestamp to check element expiration, while .lookup and .update (used from packet path) and asynchronous GC continue to use the current time. This ensures that elements do not expire before the transaction completes.",
     "details": [
        "A timestamp field is added to the nftables per-netns structure.",
        "The functions .insert, .deactivate and sync GC are modified to use the timestamp in the per-netns structure when checking if elements have expired.",
         "The functions .lookup and .update and asynchronous GC still use current time for the timeout check"
     ]
