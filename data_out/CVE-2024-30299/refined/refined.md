- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly authenticate users, which can be exploited to bypass security mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, allowing attackers to gain higher levels of access or control within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (AV:N), exploiting the vulnerability through the network with low attack complexity (AC:L) and no required privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges on the system and can exploit the vulnerability over the network.
