The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DaVinci MMC driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `davinci_mmcsd_remove` function, responsible for cleaning up resources when the MMC device is unbound, was marked with `__exit`. When the driver is built-in (CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y), the `__exit` attribute causes the `remove` callback to be discarded, meaning the cleanup is not performed when the device is unbound via sysfs or hotplug.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the incorrect use of `__exit` on the remove function.  This results in a resource leak and causes a section mismatch during the kernel build process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The main impact is resource leaks due to the cleanup function not being called.  While not explicitly mentioned, repeated unbinding and rebinding could potentially lead to instability or resource exhaustion of the system over time.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by unbinding the MMC device through sysfs or a hotplug event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to unbind the MMC device, which could be achieved through administrative privileges or by controlling a hotplug event.
