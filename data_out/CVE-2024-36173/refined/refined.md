*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before being stored and displayed, which leads to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requires low complexity (AC:L) and a low privilege attacker (PR:L), with the need for a user interaction (UI:R).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileged access to the system and be able to inject malicious script. The exploitation requires a user interaction to trigger the execution of the malicious script.
