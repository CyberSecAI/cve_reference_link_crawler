{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings and command parameters without checking the size of the input parameters against the size of the stack buffer, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The specific capabilities required are not explicitly mentioned but are implied to include access to the network where the device is connected.",
  "CVE ID": "CVE-2022-40992",
  "Additional Details": "This specific vulnerability (CVE-2022-40992) is triggered by the command `no firmwall domain WORD description (WORD|null)`. The vulnerable code is `sprintf(stack_0x80,\"%d<%s<%s\",1,*argv,argv[1]);` where `stack_0x80` is a stack buffer of size 0x80 and the `WORD` parameter is not size checked before being copied into the buffer via `sprintf`."
