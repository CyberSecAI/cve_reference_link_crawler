Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6296

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `data-caption` parameter within the Stackable â€“ Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `data-caption` attribute). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML which is then stored in the database. This code is then executed when the page is viewed.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `data-caption` attribute of image elements within the Stackable plugin.
- Lack of output encoding for the `data-caption` attribute when rendered on the frontend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser:**  When a user views a page containing the injected malicious script, the attacker's JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing website content
    - Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `data-caption` parameter of image elements within the Stackable plugin. This data is then stored in the WordPress database.
- When a page containing this manipulated image is viewed by any user, the injected JavaScript code executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated User with Contributor Level Access or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to inject the malicious script using the vulnerable `data-caption` parameter of image elements.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Stackable plugin up to and including 3.13.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.13.2 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is DOM-based, meaning the malicious payload is injected directly in the HTML which gets rendered on the page.
- The fix involves sanitizing the user-supplied input and correctly encoding the output.
