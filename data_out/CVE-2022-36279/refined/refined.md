- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `delfile.cgi` script uses `sprintf` to construct a command to delete a file, without validating the length of the filename parameter provided by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to unbounded copy using `sprintf`
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/delfile.cgi` endpoint with an overly long `_filename` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the router and must have valid basic authentication credentials.
