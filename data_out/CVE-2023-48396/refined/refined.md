  "CVE-2023-48396": {
    "description": "Web Authentication vulnerability in Apache SeaTunnel. Since the jwt key is hardcoded in the application, an attacker can forge any token to log in any user.",
    "root_cause": "The JWT key is hardcoded within the application's configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded cryptographic key",
      "Authentication bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can forge a JWT token, allowing them to log in as any user.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to gain access to the application's configuration file (application.yml), specifically the location /seatunnel-server/seatunnel-app/src/main/resources/application.yml to obtain the hardcoded JWT key.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the application's configuration file or have knowledge of the hardcoded key. Once the key is known they can generate a valid JWT token."
