Cross-site scripting in bootstrap.jsp in multiple versions of OpenNMS Meridian and Horizon allows an attacker access to confidential session information. The solution is to upgrade to Horizon 32.0.5 or newer and Meridian 2023.1.9 or newer










Meridian
and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for
installation within an organization's private networks and should not be
directly accessible from the Internet. 

OpenNMS thanks

 for reporting this issue.
