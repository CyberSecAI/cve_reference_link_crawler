# privilege escalation vulnerability with the `admin:users` scope

High

[minrk](/minrk)
published
GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f
Aug 8, 2024

## Package

pip

jupyterhub
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.6, 5.0.0

## Patched versions

4.1.6, 5.1.0

## Description

### Summary

If a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user.

### Details

The `admin:users` scope allows a user to edit user records:

> admin:users
>
> Read, write, create and delete users and their authentication state, not including their servers or tokens.
>
> -- <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#available-scopes>

However, this includes making users admins. Admin users are granted scopes beyond `admin:users` making this a mechanism by which granted scopes may be escalated.

### Impact

The impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.

In effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended.

Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-41942

### Weaknesses

[CWE-274](/advisories?query=cwe%3A274)
