The provided content relates to a fix for a DMA mapping leak in the Intel ICE driver within the Linux kernel. This corresponds to CVE-2022-48690, as the vulnerability involves a memory leak due to improper handling of DMA mappings during RX buffer reallocation in the ice driver.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a failure to properly manage DMA mappings when reallocating RX buffers. Specifically, when the user changes RX ring parameters, new DMA mappings are created, but the old mappings are not released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **DMA Mapping Leak:**  When RX ring parameters are changed, the driver allocates new RX buffers and their associated DMA mappings. However, the previously allocated buffers and their DMA mappings are not released before the old `rx_buf` is freed with `kfree`, resulting in a memory leak of the already mapped DMA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Repeatedly changing RX ring parameters will lead to a continuous accumulation of leaked DMA mappings, eventually exhausting available memory.
- **System Instability:** Memory exhaustion can lead to system instability, including crashes, and potentially denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local User:** A local user with the ability to use the `ethtool` command to modify network interface parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to execute `ethtool` commands with sufficient privileges to change the network interface settings (specifically, to modify rx and tx ring sizes)

**Technical Details**
The fix addresses the issue by:

-   **Reallocating ZC Buffers:** When a BPF program is loaded, the driver now reallocates RX buffers to use `xdp_buf` structures, and reallocates them back to `rx_buf` when the program is unloaded. This ensures the correct memory layout is used with BPF programs.
-   **Reallocating RX Queues**: When XSK pools are created along with BPF program loading/unloading, RX queues are reallocated to ensure proper mapping of buffers.
-   **Introducing `ice_realloc_zc_buf`:** A new function is introduced to handle reallocation of XDP Zero-Copy (ZC) queue pairs. It reallocates buffers for RX rings that might be used by XSK, as XDP requires more memory than `rx_buf` provides. This function ensures that when the driver switches between using XDP and regular RX queues, the memory is correctly managed.
-   **Modifying `ice_vsi_cfg_rxq`:**  The `ice_vsi_cfg_rxq` function was modified to avoid freeing the `rx_buf` without first dealing with the associated DMA mappings.
-   **Modifying `ice_xsk_pool_setup`**: The function now calls `ice_realloc_rx_xdp_bufs` to reallocate memory.
- The fix includes the addition of `ice_realloc_rx_xdp_bufs` which is used to reallocate either `rx_buf` or `xdp_buf` as needed and to ensure that the old buffers are freed, and the correct buffer type is allocated
- It removes the functions `ice_alloc_rx_buf_zc` and `ice_alloc_rx_buf`
