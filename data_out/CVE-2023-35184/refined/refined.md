Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-35184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data. The SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) improperly handles deserialization, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Remote Code Execution: The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
-  Insecure Deserialization: The application fails to validate or sanitize serialized data before processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Remote Code Execution: Attackers can gain full control of the system by executing arbitrary code. This can lead to data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious requests over the network to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Unauthenticated Access: The attacker does not need to have valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
-  Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SolarWinds ARM service.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in SolarWinds ARM versions 2023.2.0.73 and prior.
-  The vulnerability was fixed in SolarWinds ARM 2023.2.1.
- The CVSS score is 8.8 (High), indicating a critical risk.
- The attack vector is Adjacent (AV:A), indicating the attacker needs to be on the same network as the target. The complexity is Low (AC:L), and no privileges are required (PR:N). User interaction is not required (UI:N).
