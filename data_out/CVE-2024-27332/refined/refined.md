{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JPG files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Insufficient data validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially combine this vulnerability with others to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens a malicious JPG file or visits a malicious page containing such a file. User interaction is required.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPG file to the target user, for example by tricking them into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious document. No special privileges are required."
