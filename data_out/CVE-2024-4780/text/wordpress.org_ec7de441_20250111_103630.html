From an SEO perspective, adding title tags, headings and descriptions to your images is indispensable. Title tags and descriptions almost always garner a click from the user whereas keywords in titles and headings can help your website rank higher in search results.

Image Hover Effects for Elementor lets you do all that and more in just a span of few seconds. Just add the title of your image to the Title field and set the tag (H1-H6, paragraph, span). Then add the description to the Description field. That’s all there is to it. Now you can customize the look of your text to being neat and crisp or wild and artistic or choose from a multitude of other choices.

Another important factor is linking to specific pages or interlinking to drive traffic. Image Hover Effects provides an option to link your image to a specified URL.
