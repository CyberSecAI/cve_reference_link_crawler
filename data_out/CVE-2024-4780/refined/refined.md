Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4780

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `eihe_link` parameter within the Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `eihe_link` parameter, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script execution: Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable element. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    - Defacement: Altering the appearance of the web page.
    - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Data theft: Gaining access to sensitive user data.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `eihe_link` parameter, which can be manipulated to include malicious JavaScript code. This parameter is part of the plugin's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher: Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor role privileges.
- Ability to create/edit content: The attacker must be able to create or edit content on the site where the vulnerable plugin is used.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Image Hover Effects – Elementor Addon plugin up to and including version 1.4.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.4.
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/widgets.php`.
- The fix involves properly sanitizing the `eihe_link` parameter using `add_link_attributes` to prevent XSS.

This vulnerability allows for stored XSS, which means the malicious script persists and can affect other users who visit the injected page.
