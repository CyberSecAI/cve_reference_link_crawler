```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is triggered due to premature deletion of objects associated with pages via a JavaScript 'Calculate' action in a PDF document. After the objects are freed, the application attempts to use them without validation, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use-after-free (CWE-416)"
  ],
  "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could gain control of the application and system by manipulating the freed memory layout.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PDF document or a malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled. The user must open the malicious PDF document or visit the malicious site to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF document with JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerable code path. The user needs to be tricked into opening the crafted PDF document or visiting a malicious site with the browser plugin enabled."
