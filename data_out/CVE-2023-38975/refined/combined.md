| Wrong dim when create collection may cause db service down Current Behavior Denial of Service, Users can not use the vector database normally Steps to Reproduce some bugs related with the dim of vector when create collection, which can cause DoS Details  version: 1.3.2  ``` FPE  ```  at <https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/lib/segment/src/vector_storage/chunked_vectors.rs#L28>, it check cannot be 0, but vector\_size may be zero if dim too big such as 2\*\*63. Then it will divide zero  ``` OOM  ```  if dim is too big, the vector::new will failed on my 128G memory server, and service will down. PoC  ``` from qdrant_client import QdrantClient from qdrant_client import models  c = QdrantClient(host="127.0.0.1", port=6333) c.recreate_collection(     collection_name="test",     vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=2**63, distance=models.Distance.COSINE), )  # [2023-05-30T08:25:32.996Z ERROR qdrant::startup] Panic occurred in file lib/segment/src/vector_storage/chunked_vectors.rs at line 28: attempt to divide by zero  ```  ``` c = QdrantClient(host="127.0.0.1", port=6333) c.recreate_collection(     collection_name="test",     vectors_config={         "payload": models.VectorParams(size=2**59, distance=models.Distance.DOT),     } )  #memory allocation of 2305843009213693952memory allocation of  bytes failed #2305843009213693952 bytes failed #Aborted (core dumped)  ``` Possible Solution check the value range  P.S This bug can also effect the cloud service |

| Hi, I think the running service can prompt the user that "the value is not appropriate" instead of the service crashing directly. |

| Maybe we can compare the memory to be allocated with the free memory of the server, or use exception handling, or refer to the rfc [2116](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2116-alloc-me-maybe.md) |
