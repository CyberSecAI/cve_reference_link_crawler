**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the SocketService module of Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro. This module listens on UDP port 41222 by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing authentication for the SocketService module. This allows unauthenticated access to the module's functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to the vulnerable service via UDP port 41222.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required. The attacker does not need a privileged network position and can be located remotely.
