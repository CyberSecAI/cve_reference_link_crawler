The provided content is related to CVE-2016-15039.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the improper setting of HTTP request headers, specifically `Content-length` and `Connection` in the `ajax_functions.js` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code sets the `Content-Length` and `Connection` headers, which can be exploited in HTTP request smuggling attacks. According to the provided link, `https://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-setrequestheader%28%29-method`, the browser should ignore these headers if they are set. However, the application is explicitly setting them which could lead to inconsistencies between the application's perception and the server's processing of the request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The commit message states "Fixed request smuggling vulnerability," indicating that an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to inject malicious data into HTTP requests, leading to various impacts, such as unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests that manipulate how the server interprets request boundaries. The attacker could leverage this inconsistency in how the length and connection headers are treated by the client vs the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application or have a position where they can intercept and modify client requests.
