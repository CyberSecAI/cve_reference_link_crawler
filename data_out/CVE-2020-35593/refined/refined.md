{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The BMC Patrol Agent service executes the command 'cmd /c boottime' upon startup without specifying an absolute path. This causes the operating system to search for the executable using the PATH environment variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Patrol Agent service insecurely executes the 'boottime' command using the PATH environment variable. ",
      "The service does not validate the path of the binary, allowing a malicious file to be executed from a user-writable location in the PATH.",
	  "The service can be restarted using the 'pconfig +RESTART -host' command by an unprivileged user via the Patrol CLI application."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can gain SYSTEM level privileges by placing a malicious executable or script named 'boottime' into a user-writable directory that is present in the system's PATH environment variable. Restarting the BMC Patrol Agent service then causes the malicious 'boottime' file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker exploits the insecure execution of the 'boottime' command by placing a malicious executable or script into a folder within the PATH environment variable that is writable by the unprivileged user. ",
      "An attacker can restart the BMC Patrol Agent service remotely using the 'pconfig +RESTART -host' command, which then triggers the execution of the malicious 'boottime' file.",
	  "The attacker uses the BMC Patrol CLI application to send commands."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a domain user account and access to the BMC PATROL CLI application to send commands to the vulnerable agent. The attacker also requires the ability to write files to a folder within the system's PATH environment variable."
