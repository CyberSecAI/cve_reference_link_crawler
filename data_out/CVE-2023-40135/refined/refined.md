  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification of URI permissions within the RemoteViews of Autofill FillResponse.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient URI permission checks",
      "Security spill vulnerability where a user could potentially view content of another user through a malicious Autofill provider."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious autofill provider could potentially expose content of another user due to the lack of URI permission checks. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious Autofill provider that is used in the context of another user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Autofill provider. The provider needs to return a FillResponse containing a RemoteViews with a URI for which the current user does not have permissions."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2023-40135",
  "description": "The provided commit fixes a security spill where a user can view content of another user through a malicious Autofill provider. This was achieved by checking the permissions of URIs inside FillResponse's RemoteViews. If the current user does not have the required permissions to view the URI, the RemoteView is dropped from displaying."
