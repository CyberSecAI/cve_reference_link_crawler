The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.112 due to insufficient IP address validation and/or use of user-supplied HTTP headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers  to bypass antispam functionality in the Form Builder widgets.
