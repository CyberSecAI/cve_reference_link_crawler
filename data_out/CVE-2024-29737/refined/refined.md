```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation in the project module's Maven build parameter handling allows for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection due to lack of proper input sanitization of build arguments.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution on the server hosting the Apache StreamPark instance.",
  "Attack vectors": "By adding or modifying a project's build arguments within the Apache StreamPark web interface. Specifically, by inserting shell commands into the 'Build Argument' field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a logged-in user with system-level permissions within the Apache StreamPark application. This suggests the attacker has already gained access to the web interface and has elevated privileges to manage projects."
