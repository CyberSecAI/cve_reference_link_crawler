Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** XXE (XML External Entity) Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the `ebookmeta.get_metadata()` function when used with specific versions of `ebookmeta` and `lxml` libraries. Specifically, when `ebookmeta` is less than version 1.2.8 and `lxml` is less than 4.9.1, the XML parsing is vulnerable to XXE injection.

**Weaknesses:** The code fails to properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing XML data, specifically within the `get_metadata` function.

**Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive information from the server. This is a typical impact of XXE vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious XML document containing an external entity definition that points to a local file. This crafted XML would then be processed by the vulnerable `ebookmeta.get_metadata()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML input to the vulnerable function. This would likely involve using the `ebookmeta` library with a crafted XML that's processed by `get_metadata`.

**Additional Details**
- The issue was reported by user `peri0d`.
- The affected versions of the libraries are `ebookmeta < 1.2.8` and `lxml < 4.9.1`.
