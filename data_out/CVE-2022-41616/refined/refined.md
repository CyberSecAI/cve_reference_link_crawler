Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Export Users Data CSV plugin (versions <= 2.1) is vulnerable to CSV Injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided data before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas into the CSV file.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: If a victim opens the crafted CSV file with spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets), the malicious formulas can be executed. This could allow an attacker to:
    *   Exploit vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software itself.
    *   Execute arbitrary commands on the victim's computer, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts malicious formulas within the user data that will be exported via the plugin's functionality. A user with subscriber level access could potentially create or manipulate their user data to include such formulas.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with "subscriber" privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability. They would need to be able to manipulate data that is exported by the plugin to insert malicious CSV formulas.

The content also provides the following information:

*   **CVSS Score**: 7.6 (though noted as not ideal for CMSs and severity is categorized as low)
*   **Fixed version**: 2.2
*   **Patch priority**: Low
*   **OWASP Top 10**: A1: Injection
*   **Classification**: CSV Injection
