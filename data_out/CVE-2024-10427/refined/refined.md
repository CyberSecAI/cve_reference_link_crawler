Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper user input validation of the `refno` parameter in the `deleteanimal.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries directly into the database. The application uses the parameter directly in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection in the `deleteanimal.php` file, specifically in how the `refno` parameter is handled.
*   Insufficient Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data.
*   Comprehensive system control: In severe cases, attackers can gain control over the entire system.
*   Service interruption: The attack can cause service interruption.
*   Business continuity risk: The vulnerability poses a serious threat to system security and business continuity.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `refno` parameter in the `deleteanimal.php` file.
*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via HTTP requests, such as POST requests, by manipulating the `refno` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring login or authorization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authorization or login credentials.
*  The attacker needs to craft SQL injection payloads.
