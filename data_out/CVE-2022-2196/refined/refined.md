Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-2196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A regression in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation for Intel CPUs, specifically affecting Spectre v2 mitigation for nested virtualization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate isolation of indirect branch predictor modes between L1 and L2 VMs when using KVM as the L0 hypervisor, which can allow the L2 VM to influence the branch prediction of the L1 hypervisor. This issue arises because L1 and L2 VMs share hardware predictor modes (guest-user and guest-kernel) and hardware IBRS is not sufficient to virtualize IBRS in this scenario.
- The fix involves executing IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier) on emulated VM-exit to ensure that the predicted targets of indirect branches executed in L1 cannot be controlled by software executed in L2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leak: An L2 guest can leak sensitive information from its L1 hypervisor.
- Denial of Service (DoS): While not explicitly stated, the nature of the vulnerability and the common consequences of speculative execution flaws could lead to DoS by causing incorrect execution paths.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Nested Virtualization: An attacker requires control over a virtual machine (L2) nested within another virtual machine (L1) using KVM as the hypervisor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code within an L2 guest VM that runs on an L1 hypervisor using KVM.
- The attacker needs to be able to exploit the speculative execution vulnerability of the CPU.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The fix involves adding an IBPB on emulated VM-exit when the guest has IBRS.
*   The issue is caused by the fact that hardware IBRS is not sufficient in the context of nested virtualization.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or DoS. NetApp rates this vulnerability as High with a CVSS score of 8.8.
*   The Debian LTS advisory indicates that the fix addresses a regression in KVM which affected the Spectre v2 mitigation for nested virtualization, allowing an L2 guest to leak sensitive information from its L1 hypervisor.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux Kernel versions prior to 6.2, according to NetApp.
*   NetApp lists specific products affected which use the Linux Kernel; they are NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S
