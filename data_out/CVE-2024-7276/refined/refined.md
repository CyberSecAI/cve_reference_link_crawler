Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/admin/member_save.php` page of the Alton Management System version 1.0.
- The `first` and `last` parameters passed to this page are not properly sanitized, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by a lack of input validation or sanitization of the `first` and `last` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates time-based blind SQL injection. This indicates a potential for attackers to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify database contents.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `/admin/member_save.php` page.
- The attacker needs to include malicious SQL payloads within the `first` or `last` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable page (`/admin/member_save.php`).

**Technical Details:**
- The PoC demonstrates time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)` to confirm the vulnerability and can be used for exfiltration.
- The SQL payloads provided in the PoC include:
    - `last=123&first=123' AND (SELECT 9651 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))LDVG) AND 'Zjoq'='Zjoq&contact=123&address=123` (for the first parameter)
    - `last=123' AND (SELECT 9207 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))IyrR) AND 'YcaK'='YcaK&first=123&contact=123&address=123` (for the last parameter)
    - These payloads insert a `SLEEP(5)` command into the SQL query, causing a delay if the injection is successful.

This information aligns with the typical characteristics of a SQL injection vulnerability as described in the provided content.
