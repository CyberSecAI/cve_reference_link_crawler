      "summary": "The Inosoft VisiWin 7 software installation creates insecure folder permissions. The vulnerability is present in versions up to 2022-2.1. The insecure folder permissions allow a malicious user to manipulate file content or change legitimate files (e.g., VisiWin7.Server.Manager.exe which runs with SYSTEM privileges) to compromise a system or to gain elevated privileges. The specific insecure folder and file permissions are:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\INOSOFT GmbH with full control permissions for BUILTIN\\Administrators, Everyone, and NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\INOSOFT GmbH\\VisiWin7\\Runtime\\VisiWin7.Server.Manager.exe with full control permissions for BUILTIN\\Administrators, Everyone, and NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",

The software creates a directory with insufficient permissions, allowing a low-level user to modify files that hold SYSTEM privileges, leading to privilege escalation. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-31468, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) and a CVSS v4 base score of 8.5 (CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). The vulnerability was discovered by CISA based on a PoC by Carlo Di Dato. Mitigation involves updating to VisiWin version 2024-1 or later. Additional mitigations include minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and employing VPNs with caution.",
