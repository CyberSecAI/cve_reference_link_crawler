# Exploit Title: Inosoft VisiWin 7 2022-2.1 - Insecure Folders Permissions
Privilege Escalation
# Date: 2023-08-09
# Exploit Author: Carlo Di Dato for Deloitte Risk Advisory Italia
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.inosoft.com/
# Version: Up to 2022-2.1 (Runtime RT7.3 RC3 20221209.5)
# Tested on: Windows
# CVE: CVE-2023-31468

Inosoft VisiWin is a completely open system with a configurable range of
functions. It combines all features of classic HMI software with
unlimited programming possibilities.
The installation of the solution will create insecure folder, and this
could allow a malicious user to manipulate file content or change
legitimate files (e.g., VisiWin7.Server.Manager.exe which runs with
SYSTEM privileges) to compromise a system or to gain elevated
privileges.

This is the list of insecure files and folders with their respective
permissions:

C:\>icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\INOSOFT GmbH"
C:\Program Files (x86)\INOSOFT GmbH BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
                                     Everyone:(OI)(CI)(F)
                                     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

CISA discovered a PoC (Proof of concept) as authored by Carlo Di Dato and reported it to Inosoft.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Inosoft recommends users to update to VisiWin [version 2024-1.](https://www.inosoft.com/en/downloads/visiwin-versions/)

For more information, please visit VisiWin's [support page.](https://www.inosoft.com/en/news-details/news/neue-visiwin-version-2024-1/)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.

# New VisiWin Version 2024-1

05/22/2024

[![](/fileadmin/_processed_/7/7/csm_2024-05_Neue_VisiWin_Version_7704b39438.jpg)](/fileadmin/_processed_/7/7/csm_2024-05_Neue_VisiWin_Version_d0656c48ee.jpg)

**NEW VISIWIN VERSION 2024-1**

**With its completely open architecture, our HMI software allows to create open solutions based on standards thus offering unlimited HMI possibilities. Nevertheless, machine manufacturers don’t have to dispense with the countless configurable system functions. VisiWin is constantly further developed—many VisiWin features originate from the close relationship with our customers. Your requirements and good ideas are always appreciated and, if possible, implemented in VisiWin.**

The new VisiWin 7 version 2024-1 is now available for download in the [download area of our website](https://www.inosoft.com/en/downloads/visiwin-versions/). The setup includes the following components:

IDE (Visual Studio integration included) (new)

Runtime system 7.3 SP2

Runtime system 7.2 SP20

**Security Patch**

Version 2024-1 closes a security issue in the VisiWin 7 installer that allowed a potential attacker to replace executable program files in the installation directory with malicious programs. Details are described in the Readme.txt file.

**Development System**

The open project view now provides a better representation of the timing of recently opened projects. Additionally, the IDE can now resolve NuGet packages and supports building of projects with corresponding references. The project selection in the "Project Comparison" tool now contains an integrated history for easy selection of recently used projects.

When importing variables from TIA Portal projects, a new option can now be used to specify that only variables with the attribute "Accessible from HMI" are offered for import.

**Web UI**

The behavior of the TrendChart when querying historical data has been optimized. An optional loading symbol can now be used to indicate that the control is retrieving data.

A template is now available for developing custom controls and can easily be added to the project via the IDE.

Various new styling properties in the controls now allow individual adjustments for the hover state.

**Cross-Platform Server**

External manipulation of recipe files can now be detected and the loading of such files can be prevented.

**VisiWin 7 OPC UA Server for Linux**

The VisiWin 7 OPC UA Server is now provided via the VisiWin 7 Docker image and can therefore also be used on Linux-based devices.

**Bug fixes and optimizations**

As usual, the version comes with a number of improvements and bug fixes, which are listed in the change history.
