# New VisiWin Version 2024-1

05/22/2024

[![](/fileadmin/_processed_/7/7/csm_2024-05_Neue_VisiWin_Version_7704b39438.jpg)](/fileadmin/_processed_/7/7/csm_2024-05_Neue_VisiWin_Version_d0656c48ee.jpg)

**NEW VISIWIN VERSION 2024-1**

**With its completely open architecture, our HMI software allows to create open solutions based on standards thus offering unlimited HMI possibilities. Nevertheless, machine manufacturers don’t have to dispense with the countless configurable system functions. VisiWin is constantly further developed—many VisiWin features originate from the close relationship with our customers. Your requirements and good ideas are always appreciated and, if possible, implemented in VisiWin.**

The new VisiWin 7 version 2024-1 is now available for download in the [download area of our website](https://www.inosoft.com/en/downloads/visiwin-versions/). The setup includes the following components:

IDE (Visual Studio integration included) (new)

Runtime system 7.3 SP2

Runtime system 7.2 SP20

**Security Patch**

Version 2024-1 closes a security issue in the VisiWin 7 installer that allowed a potential attacker to replace executable program files in the installation directory with malicious programs. Details are described in the Readme.txt file.

**Development System**

The open project view now provides a better representation of the timing of recently opened projects. Additionally, the IDE can now resolve NuGet packages and supports building of projects with corresponding references. The project selection in the "Project Comparison" tool now contains an integrated history for easy selection of recently used projects.

When importing variables from TIA Portal projects, a new option can now be used to specify that only variables with the attribute "Accessible from HMI" are offered for import.

**Web UI**

The behavior of the TrendChart when querying historical data has been optimized. An optional loading symbol can now be used to indicate that the control is retrieving data.

A template is now available for developing custom controls and can easily be added to the project via the IDE.

Various new styling properties in the controls now allow individual adjustments for the hover state.

**Cross-Platform Server**

External manipulation of recipe files can now be detected and the loading of such files can be prevented.

**VisiWin 7 OPC UA Server for Linux**

The VisiWin 7 OPC UA Server is now provided via the VisiWin 7 Docker image and can therefore also be used on Linux-based devices.

**Bug fixes and optimizations**

As usual, the version comes with a number of improvements and bug fixes, which are listed in the change history.
