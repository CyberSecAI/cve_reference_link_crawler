- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Misaligned memory access in `fast_ping.c`
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code does not strictly adhere to byte alignment which can cause crashes on certain architectures. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in accessing a `struct fast_ping_packet` at a memory address that is not 8-byte aligned.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The misaligned memory access leads to a crash of the SmartDNS service due to an undefined behavior reported by ASan.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending DNS requests to the SmartDNS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to send DNS requests to the SmartDNS server to trigger the vulnerability.
