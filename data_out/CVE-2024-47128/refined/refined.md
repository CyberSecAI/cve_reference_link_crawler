Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2024-47128:

**CVE-2024-47128: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**

*   **Root Cause:** The goTenna Pro App sends the encryption key name in cleartext when the key is shared over RF via a broadcast message.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The encryption key name is sent unencrypted during key sharing over RF broadcast.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can eavesdrop on the RF communication and obtain the encryption key name. This could provide some information about the encryption key in use.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker within RF range can capture the broadcasted message containing the encryption key name.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be within RF communication range of the goTenna Pro devices during key sharing, specifically when the key is broadcasted.

The advisory recommends sharing the encryption key via local QR code for higher security operations to avoid the key name being broadcast in the clear.
