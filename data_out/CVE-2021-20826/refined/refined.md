### CVE-2021-20826

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Unprotected transport of credentials during communication between the PLC and software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of protection of credentials transmitted between the PLC and the software. Specifically, it does not encrypt or securely protect these credentials during transit. This falls under CWE-523, "Unprotected Transport of Credentials".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the communication and obtain the PLC Web server user credentials.
- With these credentials, the attacker can gain complete access to the PLC Web server.
- This access enables the attacker to manipulate the PLC output, potentially causing physical effects, and to suspend the PLC's operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the communication channel between the PLC and its associated software. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the transmitted credentials

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network such that they can intercept traffic between the PLC and the software used to manage or interact with it.
- No specific user interaction is required.
