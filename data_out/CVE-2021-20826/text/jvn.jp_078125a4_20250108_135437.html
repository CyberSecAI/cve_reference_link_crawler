## Impact

* An attacker may obtain the user credentials from the communication between the PLC and the software.  As a result, the PLC user program may be uploaded, altered, and/or downloaded. - CVE-2021-37400
* An attacker may obtain the user credentials from file servers, backup repositories, or ZLD files saved in SD cards.  As a result, the PLC user program may be uploaded, altered, and/or downloaded. - CVE-2021-37401
* An attacker may obtain the PLC Web server user credentials from the communication between the PLC and the software.  As a result, the complete access privileges to the PLC Web server may be obtained, and manipulation of the PLC output and/or suspension of the PLC may be conducted. -  CVE-2021-20826
* An attacker may obtain the PLC Web server user credentials from file servers, backup repositories, or ZLD files saved in SD cards.  As a result, the attacker may access the PLC Web server and hijack the PLC, and manipulation of the PLC output and/or suspension of the PLC may be conducted. - CVE-2021-20827

## Solution

**Update the software**

Apply the appropriate software update according to the information provided by the developer.

* FC6A Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module v2.40 and later
