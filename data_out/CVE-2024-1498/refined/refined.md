### CVE-2024-1498
The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Happy Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Photo Stack widget. Specifically, the code at `widgets/photo-stack/widget.php` (line 598) directly outputs the `image.url` attribute without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts injected via the `image.url` field are stored in the database and executed whenever a user accesses the page containing the vulnerable widget.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the user-provided input before storing it, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't escape the output of the `image.url` attribute when rendering the widget, leading to the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of logged-in users without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject malicious scripts by manipulating the `image.url` field in the Photo Stack widget settings.
- The malicious code will be executed whenever a user visits the page where the widget is embedded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to edit pages or posts where the Photo Stack widget can be added.
