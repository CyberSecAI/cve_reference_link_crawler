- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A CSV injection vulnerability exists in the Avaya CMS Supervisor web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data that will be interpreted as commands when opened in spreadsheet software.
- **Impact of exploitation:** When a user with administrative privileges exports data containing the injected malicious commands to a CSV file, opening the file with software like Microsoft Excel may lead to arbitrary command execution on the system where the file is opened. This means an attacker could potentially gain control over the system or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with administrative privileges can inject crafted data into the Avaya CMS Supervisor web application. The malicious payload will be triggered upon exporting and opening the resulting CSV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the Avaya CMS Supervisor web application to inject the malicious data and cause it to be exported. The attacker does not need to have access to the system where the CSV will be opened.
