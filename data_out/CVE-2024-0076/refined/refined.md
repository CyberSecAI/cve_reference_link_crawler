Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-0076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `cuobjdump` and `nvdisasm` tools of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. These tools are susceptible to a crash when processing a malformed ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The description implies that the tools attempt to read data from the malformed ELF file beyond the allocated buffer or memory region, leading to the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a **partial denial of service (DoS)**. The crash prevents the tool from functioning correctly, impacting its availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local (AV:L):** The attacker needs local access to the system where the CUDA Toolkit is installed.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Exploiting this vulnerability requires minimal effort, as the attacker simply needs to provide a specially crafted ELF file.
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):**  The user has to be tricked into using the vulnerable tools (`cuobjdump` or `nvdisasm`) to open or process the malicious ELF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the malformed ELF file to a user who then processes it with the affected tools.
- No specific user privileges are needed, but local access to the system is required for successful exploitation.
