The Event Espresso 4 Decaf â€“ Event Registration Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited unauthorized plugin settings modification due to a missing capability check on the saveTimezoneString and some other functions in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.22.decaf. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify some of the plugin settings.
