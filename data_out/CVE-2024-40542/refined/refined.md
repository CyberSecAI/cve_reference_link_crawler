The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `my-springsecurity-plus` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the `mybatis-mappers/RoleMapper.xml` file to directly inject user-controlled input into SQL queries. Specifically, the `params.dataScope` parameter is taken directly from the request and used in the SQL statement without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw caused by unsanitized user input being directly embedded into the SQL query. This is achieved using the `${}` syntax in MyBatis mapper XML.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize or validate the `params.dataScope` input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example uses a boolean blind SQL injection.
- Potential for Full Database Control: With more advanced SQL injection techniques, an attacker could potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/api/role` endpoint.
- Parameter Manipulation: The `params["dataScope"]` parameter is the entry point for injecting SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's API endpoint.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection: A basic understanding of SQL injection is required to craft the malicious input.
- Ability to identify the vulnerable parameter: The attacker must identify the `params.dataScope` parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of target's environment: Some knowledge of the database environment may be useful to effectively exploit the vulnerability.
- (Optional) Ability to use tools like sqlmap: Using tools like sqlmap can help with automating the exploitation process.
