Finally a simple plugin that works well with the Astra theme. Nothing complicated. Just install and apply the shortcode to the page.
Thanks a lot!

I have tried almost every read more plugin and this one is not only free but also works great.
Like others have said the sample codes provided by the author used non-English U+201C/D quotation mark, not English U+0022 quotation, but this is a small problem you just need to replace them.

Simple and easy, although as others have said, you do have to replace the “” in Wordpress even if you do a copy without formatting. But it’s so easy and good looking right out of the box that it deserves 5 stars. So happy to have found it.

Tried a few of these plugins and could get these to work? Maybe JS conflicts or caching plugins?
Anyway, this one works out of the box!
The shortcode took a bit of figuring out – if you copy it from the page and paste it beware the “” don’t work and you end up with only read and not read more. Simply removing and re-typing the “” fixed this and it works like a charm!

### Description

The WP show more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's show\_more shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
