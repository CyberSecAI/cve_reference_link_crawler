Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31232:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references "CVE-2021-31232" and describes a local file disclosure vulnerability in Cortex's Alertmanager component, aligning with the stated CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the following:

*   When the `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` flag is used, the Alertmanager API is exposed.
*   The `password_file` option in HTTP basic authentication can be abused to read arbitrary local files by sending the content via a webhook.
*   Alertmanager templates can load any text file specified in their list, allowing an attacker to retrieve local files by controlling the template configuration.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability to disclose the contents of local files on the server where the Cortex Alertmanager is running.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The Alertmanager doesn't properly validate the paths provided in the password file or template configurations, allowing access to files outside the intended scope.
*   **Insecure Handling of Configuration Options:** The use of file paths for password files and templates, without sufficient sanitization or restrictions, enables the vulnerability.
*   **Unrestricted File Loading:** The Alertmanager's ability to load arbitrary text files specified in templates list is a vulnerability that can be exploited.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server, such as credentials, configuration files, or private keys.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Disclosed information could be used to facilitate further attacks on the infrastructure.
*   **System Compromise:** The exploitation can lead to a full system compromise if the attacker can obtain sensitive credentials or execute commands through exposed data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Basic Auth:** An attacker can exploit the `password_file` option by crafting a request that forces the Alertmanager to read an arbitrary file via webhook.
*   **Alertmanager Templates:** An attacker can leverage the template functionality to read arbitrary files by including paths to them in the template configuration.
*   The content states that a crafted configuration can expose local file content.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Alertmanager API:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Alertmanager API if the `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` flag is enabled.
*   **Ability to Modify Alertmanager Configuration:** The attacker must have the capability to set a `password_file` or create/modify Alertmanager templates.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Cortex versions 1.7.1 and 1.8.1.
*   The fix includes changes to validate template filepaths, restrict the use of password and credential files, and preventing the loading of arbitrary files.
* The fix also includes validation on the HTTP client config to prevent usage of `password_file`, `bearer_token_file`, and `credentials_file` which could be used to read local files, also validation of the `proxy_url` field to block any request that uses it.
* TLS config was also modified so `ca_file`, `cert_file`, and `key_file` are blocked.
* Slack and VictorOps configurations were also modified to block any `api_url_file`, `global_slack_api_url_file` or `api_key_file` fields which could be used to read local files.
* The provided content indicates that the security fix was discovered proactively by Grafana Labs.
