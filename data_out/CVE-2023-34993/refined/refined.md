- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, leading to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute unauthorized commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Specifically crafted HTTP GET request parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FortiWLM instance and does not need to authenticate.
