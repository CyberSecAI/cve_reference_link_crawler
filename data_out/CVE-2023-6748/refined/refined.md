Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Information Exposure

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6748

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the 'cft' shortcode of the Custom Field Template plugin. This allows authenticated users with contributor access or higher to bypass intended restrictions and access sensitive information.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing access to the post metadata via the 'cft' shortcode.
*   **Information Exposure:** The 'cft' shortcode directly exposes arbitrary post metadata, which might contain sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract arbitrary post metadata, potentially exposing private or confidential information stored within the WordPress database, such as user data, internal notes, API keys, or other sensitive configurations depending on the site configuration and data stored.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Abuse:** Attackers can inject the vulnerable 'cft' shortcode into a post or page.
*   **Direct Access:** An attacker could potentially utilize the shortcode within a widget as well, if the option "Use the shortcode in the widget" is enabled, or in the excerpt if the option "Use the shortcode in the excerpt" is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor level permissions.
*   **Content Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts, pages, or widgets where they can insert shortcodes.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the Custom Field Template plugin up to and including 2.6.1.
*   The fix is included in version 2.6.2.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The patch includes sanitization and escaping of output, and also adds an option to disable output of protected metadata.
