- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper filtering of HTML tags within placeholders used in email previews within the pretix control panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An event organizer can inject arbitrary HTML into the control panel, which would be rendered when another event organizer uses the preview feature on the same event. Although `<script>` tags could be inserted, they would not execute due to Content Security Policy (CSP). The impact is considered low due to the CSP.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires an authenticated event organizer to insert malicious HTML code into email placeholders and another event organizer to access the preview of the email with the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated event organizer with the ability to create email templates containing placeholders. The attack requires another authenticated event organizer to view the malicious preview.
