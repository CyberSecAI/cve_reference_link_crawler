Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3268

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `emd_form_builder_lite_submit_form` function of the "YouTube Video Gallery by YouTube Showcase" plugin. This function is responsible for handling form submissions, and the absence of proper access control allows unauthenticated users to trigger it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of a capability check, which means the function can be called by anyone, regardless of their authentication status or privileges.
- **Arbitrary Post/Page Creation:** The vulnerability allows attackers to create new posts or pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Content Creation:** Unauthenticated attackers can create arbitrary posts or pages, potentially injecting malicious content, spam, or defacing the website.
- **Loss of Control:**  The ability to create unauthorized content could lead to a loss of control over the website's content and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Function:** Attackers can directly call the vulnerable `emd_form_builder_lite_submit_form` function.
- **Unauthenticated Form Submission:** The lack of authorization checks allows unauthenticated submissions to the form to be processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker must know or discover the existence and mechanics of the `emd_form_builder_lite_submit_form` function.

**Additional Information from Content:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4.0 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code was identified in the `youtube-showcase/trunk/includes/emd-form-builder-lite/emd-form-builder.php` file.
- Several files were modified in the 3.4.0 update, primarily to address the improper textdomain usage. This includes files under the `assets/ext/emd-meta-box` directory, which were modified to use the plugin’s textdomain of `youtube-showcase` rather than `emd-plugins` as well as the `includes/admin` directory, and files related to the `emd-form-builder-lite` module.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Lucio Sá and the fix was made by "emarket-design".
