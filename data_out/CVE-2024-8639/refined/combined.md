A full list of changes in this build is available in the [Log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/128.0.6613.120..%20128.0.6613.137?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:3-M128) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$15000][[361461526](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361461526)] High CVE-2024-8636: Heap buffer overflow in Skia. Reported by Renan Rios (@hyhy\_100) on 2024-08-22

[$11000][[361784548](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361784548)] High CVE-2024-8637: Use after free in Media Router. Reported by lime(@limeSec\_) from TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at QI-ANXIN Group on 2024-08-23

[TBD][[362539773](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/362539773)] High CVE-2024-8638: Type Confusion in V8. Reported by Zhenghang Xiao (@Kipreyyy) on 2024-08-28

[TBD][[362658609](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/362658609)] High CVE-2024-8639: Use after free in Autofill. Reported by lime(@limeSec\_) from TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at QI-ANXIN Group on 2024-08-28

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[365619166](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/365619166)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/), [libFuzzer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/testing/libfuzzer/README.md), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
