## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# My Sticky Bar < 2.7.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "My Sticky Bar > Create New Bar" and create a new bar
2. Then go to "My Sticky Bar > Dashboard" and edit the bar you previously created
3. In the bar text, add the payload `&lt;script&gt;prompt(document.domain)&lt;/script&gt;`
4. Save the form
5. The XSS will be triggered when editing the bar
