Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. These scripts will then be executed when other users view the affected pages, allowing the attacker to perform actions in the context of the victim's session.

Attack vectors: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) to modify the plugin settings through the "My Sticky Bar" admin interface.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have administrative or similar high-level privileges within the WordPress installation to access the plugin settings.
