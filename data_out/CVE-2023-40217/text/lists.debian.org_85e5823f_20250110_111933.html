Package        : python3.7
Version        : 3.7.3-2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48564 CVE-2022-48565 CVE-2022-48566
                 CVE-2023-40217

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Python 3.7.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free problem was found in the heappushpop function in
    the heapq module.

CVE-2022-48564

    A potential denial-of-service vulnerability was discovered in the
    read_ints function used when processing certain malformed Apple
    Property List files in binary format.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered.  In order to
    avoid possible vulnerabilities, the plistlib module no longer
    accepts entity declarations in XML plist files.

CVE-2022-48566

    Possible constant-time-defeating compiler optimisations were
    discovered in the accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-40217

    It was discovered that it might be possible to bypass some of the
    protections implemented by the TLS handshake in the ssl.SSLSocket
    class.  For example, unauthenticated data might be read by a program
    expecting data authenticated by client certificates.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.7.3-2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.7 packages.
