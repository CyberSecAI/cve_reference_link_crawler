Package        : python3.7
Version        : 3.7.3-2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48564 CVE-2022-48565 CVE-2022-48566
                 CVE-2023-40217

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Python 3.7.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free problem was found in the heappushpop function in
    the heapq module.

CVE-2022-48564

    A potential denial-of-service vulnerability was discovered in the
    read_ints function used when processing certain malformed Apple
    Property List files in binary format.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered.  In order to
    avoid possible vulnerabilities, the plistlib module no longer
    accepts entity declarations in XML plist files.

CVE-2022-48566

    Possible constant-time-defeating compiler optimisations were
    discovered in the accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-40217

    It was discovered that it might be possible to bypass some of the
    protections implemented by the TLS handshake in the ssl.SSLSocket
    class.  For example, unauthenticated data might be read by a program
    expecting data authenticated by client certificates.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.7.3-2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python3.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.16-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-23336 CVE-2022-0391 CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48565
                 CVE-2022-48566 CVE-2023-24329 CVE-2023-40217

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

CVE-2021-23336

    Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
    urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
    attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
    cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
    (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
    malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
    usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
    include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

CVE-2022-0391

    The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
    components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
    input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
    allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
    module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
    XML vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-48566

    An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
    Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
    variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-24329

    An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
    blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

CVE-2023-40217

    The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
    servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
    created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
    there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
    as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
    still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
    authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
    authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
    is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
    connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
    vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
    initialization of the SSLSocket.)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

Description
Instances of ssl.SSLSocket are vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake
and included protections (like certificate verification) and treating sent
unencrypted data as if it were post-handshake TLS encrypted data if the
socket is closed before initiating its own handshake.

This vulnerability is of severity: *\*HIGH\**.

The vulnerability is caused when a socket is connected, data is sent by the
malicious peer and stored in a buffer, and then the malicious peer closes
the socket within a small timing window before the other peers’ TLS
handshake can begin. After this sequence of events the closed socket will
not immediately attempt a TLS handshake due to not being connected but will
also allow the buffered data to be read as if a successful TLS handshake
had occurred.

Affected usages

This vulnerability *\*primarily affects\** HTTPS servers and other server-side
protocols using TLS client authentication (such as mTLS) due to requiring
reading data immediately after the handshake to be vulnerable. Operations
which would fail on a closed socket (like sending data) immediately after
the handshake are not affected by this vulnerability.

Because disconnecting the socket is a necessary step to trigger the
vulnerability *\*there is no risk of data exfiltration or data leakage
directly from the malicious TLS connection\**, however the vulnerability
*\*does\** carry risk for modifying or deleting resources which are
authenticated using only TLS client certificates.

This vulnerability *\*affects\** clients who are reading and processing data
from the server after a TLS handshake without sending any data first. Our
team is unaware of a protocol that uses TLS that fits this usage pattern.

This vulnerability *\*does not affect\** client-side HTTPS connections like pip
or requests as an HTTP request must be sent before an HTTP response is read
meaning the connection would already be closed by the time the client is
sending an HTTP request, leading to an error.

This vulnerability *\*affects, but has no impact\** on servers that aren’t
using TLS client certificate authentication as traffic to a
non-authenticating TLS server loses nothing from a bypassed handshake to
inject a query and close the connection as the same action could be taken
by a peer using a TLS connection with a proper handshake.

Affected versions

* Python 3.12.0a1 to 3.12.0rc1 \*
* Python 3.11.0 to 3.11.4
* Python 3.10.0 to 3.10.12
* Python 3.9.0 to 3.9.17
* Python 3.8.0 to 3.8.17
* Python 3.7.17 and earlier \*\*

* Note that Python 3.12.0rc2 will not be published for a few weeks.
  *\*Pre-release
  versions of Python are not recommended for production use.\**

\*\* *\*Note that Python 3.7.17 and earlier will not be receiving an upstream
security fix due to being end-of-life
<<https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions>>,\** contact your distributor
of Python for additional guidance.

Remediation and work-arounds

* Upgrade to Python 3.11.5, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, or 3.8.18.
* Apply a patch for your corresponding version of Python.
* Add a call to SSLSocket.getpeername() after calling
  SSLSocket.wrap\_socket() before any calls to SSLSocket.recv(). This call
  to getpeername() will raise an OSError if the socket isn’t connected
  thus mitigating the vulnerability.

Patches are available for all affected feature, bugfix, and security
branches of Python:

# Python Security

# Reporting security issues with PyPI or a project hosted on PyPI

See the security issue information for pypi.org
[here](https://pypi.org/security/).

# Reporting security issues

The Python Software Foundation and the Python developer community take
security vulnerabilities very seriously. A Python Security Response Team (PSRT) has
been formed that does triage on all reported vulnerabilities and works to resolve them. To reach the response team, send email to
security at python dot org. Only the response team members will see your
email, and it will be treated confidentially.

The PSRT mailing list is tightly controlled, so you can have confidence that
your security issue will only be read by a highly trusted cabal of Python
developers. If for some reason you wish to further encrypt your message to this mailing list
(for example, if your mail system does not use TLS),
you can use our shared [OpenPGP key](#opengpg-key) which is also available on the public
keyservers.

The PSRT accepts security reports for the following projects:

* CPython versions (supported and end-of-life) available at <https://python.org/downloads>
* pip versions available at <https://pypi.org/project/pip>

The PSRT does not accept reports for third-party redistributions of Python or pip.
Those reports should be directed towards their corresponding distribution security contact.

## Vulnerability handling

The following is an overview of the vulnerability handling process from reporting to disclosure:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to the PSRT.
* If the PSRT determines the report isn't a vulnerability, the issue can be opened in a public issue tracker if applicable.
* If the report constitutes a vulnerability, the PSRT will work privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
* The project creates a new release to deliver the fix.
* The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix
  via an advisory. At this point the vulnerability can be discussed publicly by the reporter and team.

## Bug bounties

While we sincerely appreciate and encourage reports of suspected security problems in supported Python releases and the PSF web infrastructure, please note that the Python Software Foundation does not run any bug bounty programs. We are a nonprofit organization, depending on donation and support from the community.

# Published advisories and mailing list

Security advisories are published to multiple public locations. Advisories are sent via email to the
[security-announce@python.org mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/security-announce.python.org/). Subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to be updated
on newly published security advisories. The mailing list has a [public archive](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/latest) including all historical advisories sent to the list.

There is also an [advisory database](https://github.com/psf/advisory-database) published to GitHub using the [Open Source Vulnerability](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/) (OSV) format which can be consumed
using automated tooling.

# CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) contact

If you need to contact the Python Software Foundation CNA directly, such as for updating or disputing a CVE record,
you can send an email to cna at python dot org. Be sure that the CVE record in question was
issued by the PSF CNA and not a different CNA.
