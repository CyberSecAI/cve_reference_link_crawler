# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1767

## Yifan YF325 validate.so diag\_ping\_start command execution vulnerability

##### October 11, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-32632

##### SUMMARY

A command execution vulnerability exists in the validate.so diag\_ping\_start functionality of Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108. A specially crafted network request can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108

##### PRODUCT URLS

YF325 - <https://yifanwireless.com/entry-level-wifi-router/yf325-series-gprs/3g/4g-wifi-router-with-sim-card-slot.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-284 - Improper Access Control

##### DETAILS

The Yifan YF325 is an industrial cellular router. This device is designed for M2M and IOT applications, allowing remote management, offering several VPN services and many other features.

The YF325 offers several APIs, several of which are managed by the same `httpd`’s `cgi_handler` function:

```
int cgi_handler(undefined mime,char *URL_path,int fd,char *query_string)

{
  [...]

  if (post == 1) {
    request_data = POST_DATA;
  }
  else {
    request_data = URL_path;
    URL_path_ = strsep(&request_data,"?");
    if (URL_path_ != (char *)0x0) {
      URL_path = URL_path_;
    }
    init_cgi(request_data);
  }
  [...]
  need_reboot = (char *)websGetVar(fd,"need_reboot","0");
  need_rebot_value = atoi(need_reboot);
  change_action = (char *)websGetVar(fd,"change_action","");
  if ((change_action != (char *)0x0) && (is_gozila = strcmp(change_action,"gozila_cgi"), is_gozila == 0)) {
    gozila_cgi(fd,0,URL_path);
    [...]
  }
  [...]
}

```

If the request’s `change_action` parameter is equal to `gozila_cgi` then the `cgi_handler` will call the `gozila_cgi` function:

```
int gozila_cgi(int fd,undefined param_2,char *URL_path)

{
    [...]

    nvram_set("gozila_action","1");
    my_next_page = '\0';
    submit_button = websGetVar(fd,"submit_button",0);                                                           [1]
    submit_type = websGetVar(fd,"submit_type",0);                                                               [2]
    godzila_ptr = (godzila_object *)handle_gozila_action(submit_button,submit_type);
    if (godzila_ptr == (godzila_object *)0x0) {
        [...]
    }
    else {
        [...]
        if (godzila_ptr->validate_function_name != (undefined *)0x0) {
            start_gozila(godzila_ptr->validate_function_name,fd);                                               [3]
        }
        [...]
    }
}

```

This function will fetch at `[1]` and `[2]` the request’s `submit_button` and `submit_type` parameters. These two are used in the `handle_gozila_action` function to fetch the correct `gozila_object` struct into the `godzila_ptr` variable. The fetched struct is used at `[3]` to call the `start_gozila` function using the `godzila_ptr->validate_function_name` value. The `godzila_ptr->validate_function_name` value is a string representing, in most of the cases, a function defined in the `validate.so` library.

If the `submit_button` is equal to `Ping` and `submit_type` is equal to `start` then the `godzila_ptr->validate_function_name` would be the string `diag_ping_start`. Following the `validate.so`’s `diag_ping_start` function:

```
void diag_ping_start(int fd)

{
  char *ping_ip;

  ping_ip = (char *)(*UwebsGetVar)(fd,"ping_ip",0);                                                             [4]
  if ((ping_ip != (char *)0x0) && (*ping_ip != '\0')) {
    unlink("/tmp/ping.log");
    nvram_set("ping_ip",ping_ip);
    setenv("PATH","/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin",1);
    sysprintf("alias ping='ping -c 3'; eval \"%s\" > %s 2>&1 &",ping_ip,"/tmp/ping.log");                     [5]
    return;
  }
  return;
}

```

The `diag_ping_start` function will fetch at `[4]` the request’s `ping_ip` parameter, which is used at `[5]` to execute the `alias ping='ping -c 3'; eval "<ping_ip>" > /tmp/ping.log 2>&1 &`. Despite the name of the functionality, which would suggest to only be used for performing ping operations, this code path is used to implement the “Diagnostic” page in the web server and execute command shell. But, because it is possible to reach the code at `[5]` without authentication, this becomes a security issue that could allow a potential attacker to execute arbitrary shell command.
