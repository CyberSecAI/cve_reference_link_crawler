The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ARM64 architecture memory management.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect handling of page map counts when splitting huge pages on ARM64. The `pmd_leaf()` function can return true even for invalid PMD entries due to the `pmd_present_invalid()` check in the previous code. This leads to `pmdp_invalidate()` both decreasing and then increasing the `file_map_count`. When `set_pte_at()` is called, the file_map_count is increased again, resulting in an unexpected `BUG_ON()` trigger.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect page table entry handling during huge page splitting.
- The `pmd_user_accessible_page()` function incorrectly determines accessibility of an invalid pmd.
- The issue leads to a kernel BUG due to an unexpected page map count.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a kernel crash (BUG_ON), leading to a denial-of-service. The provided trace shows a kernel panic resulting from the bug.
- It could potentially lead to other memory corruption or undefined behavior due to the incorrect count.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a huge page split using the `madvise` system call with specific parameters which leads to the call chain shown in the provided logs.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when splitting huge pages and this involves setting the vma behavior to MADV_HUGEPAGE.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to trigger the `madvise` system call, requiring local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the page splitting logic by setting the `MADV_HUGEPAGE` flag.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix is to add `!pmd_present_invalid()` check in `pmd_user_accessible_page()`
- The commit also identifies the fix: `Fixes: 42b2547137f5 ("arm64/mm: enable ARCH_SUPPORTS_PAGE_TABLE_CHECK")` and the issue is reproducible in `6.1.0-rc3+`
