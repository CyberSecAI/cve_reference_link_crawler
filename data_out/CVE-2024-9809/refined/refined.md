Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Online Eyewear Shop Website version 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `delete_product` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `/oews/classes/Master.php?f=delete_product` endpoint. The `id` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to directly extract sensitive information from the database, including potentially usernames, passwords, and other private data. The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the ability to extract the database name using `updatexml` function within the injected SQL query.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/oews/classes/Master.php?f=delete_product`.
*   **Malicious `id` Parameter:** The malicious payload is included in the `id` parameter of the POST request, which is then used in a vulnerable SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker requires a fundamental understanding of SQL to construct the malicious injection query.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/oews/classes/Master.php` within the `delete_product` function.
*   The `id` parameter, sent via a POST request, is used directly in an SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statements.
*   The proof of concept uses `updatexml` function to extract the database name.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided POC uses `id=2%27%20and%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(database())),3)--%20q` to demonstrate the vulnerability. This injects a malicious SQL command that extracts the database name via error message.
*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Online Eyewear Shop Website - 1.0" and is available for download at a specified link.
* The vulnerability is classified as "CRITICAL".
