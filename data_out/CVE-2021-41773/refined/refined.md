## Summary of CVE-2021-41773

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   A flaw in path normalization within the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, specifically a change that allowed path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to map URLs to files outside of the intended document root. This is achieved by using a sequence of "..%2f" which translates to "../" after URL decoding. 
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If files outside the document root are not protected by "require all denied," and if CGI scripts are enabled in those locations, remote code execution can be achieved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can access files outside the intended document root, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server if they can reach a cgi-bin directory by using the path traversal vulnerability.
*  **Denial of Service**: While not explicitly listed as an impact, the ability to read configuration files or source code could allow an attacker to plan additional attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests containing path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any prior authentication, as it's present in the path normalization logic.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  Attackers need knowledge of HTTP requests and URL encoding to craft the exploit.
*  **Target Configuration** The presence of `mod_cgi` and lack of `require all denied` on the target filesystem locations where files exist, including the scripts, makes a RCE possible.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49.
* It is known to be exploited in the wild.
*  The fix in Apache 2.4.50 was incomplete and led to CVE-2021-42013.
* The vulnerability can lead to both file disclosure and remote code execution.
*   The RCE is only possible if mod\_cgi is enabled and the target directory and file (e.g. /bin/sh) is executable by the webserver.
*   Default configurations of Apache HTTP Server may not be vulnerable to RCE, but could be vulnerable to information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability is caused by how Apache handles URLs and normalizes them before resolving the target file.
*   Attackers use URL encoding to bypass initial checks before the URL is later decoded and used for access.
*   The path traversal only works with locations mapped by `Alias` or `ScriptAlias` directives.
* There are some suggestions that the wording for CVE-2021-41773 was misleading and could have stated RCE as an impact.
