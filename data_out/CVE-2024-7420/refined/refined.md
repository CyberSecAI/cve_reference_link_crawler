Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7420

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `/admin/snippets.php` file of the "Insert PHP Code Snippet" WordPress plugin. Nonces are security tokens used to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin lacks proper nonce verification for actions related to snippet management (activate, deactivate, delete). This allows an attacker to forge requests that, if executed by an authenticated administrator, would lead to the malicious execution of these actions on the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can manipulate code snippets by:
  - **Activating** snippets: Enabling potentially malicious code.
  - **Deactivating** snippets: Disabling legitimate functionality.
  - **Deleting** snippets: Removing important code snippets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in administrator into executing it (e.g., by clicking a link or visiting a compromised page).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into executing a forged request. This might be achieved through social engineering (phishing, watering hole attack, etc.).
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 1.3.6.
- Version 1.3.7 includes a patch addressing this vulnerability by adding nonce verification for bulk actions.
- CVE-2024-43275 is noted as a potential duplicate.
- The provided code diff shows the removal of commented-out nonce checks and the addition of nonce verification for bulk actions.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.8.
