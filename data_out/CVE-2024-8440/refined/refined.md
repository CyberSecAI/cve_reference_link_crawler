### Summary of CVE-2024-8440

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Fancy Text" widget of the "Essential Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes are not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **User Compromise:** The injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page, potentially leading to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the "Fancy Text" widget of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** The attack vector is through the plugin's handling of user-supplied attributes within the Fancy Text widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Use Widget:** The attacker needs to be able to add or modify pages and have the ability to use the Fancy Text widget within Elementor.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 6.0.3.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 6.0.4.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.
