- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetSafeWanWebMan` function of the Tenda AC18 V15.03.05.05 firmware due to the usage of `strcpy` with an attacker-controlled input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The `remoteIp` parameter from a POST request is directly copied using `strcpy` into a buffer on the stack without any bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack and hijacking the program's control flow.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a POST request to the `/goform/SetRemoteWebCfg` endpoint. The `remoteIp` parameter in this request is the primary input for the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious POST request. No special privileges or authentication is explicitly stated to be required, though this is often required for web interfaces on such devices.
