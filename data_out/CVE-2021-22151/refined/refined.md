Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-22151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Kibana was not properly validating user-supplied paths when loading `.pbf` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Due to the lack of proper validation, an attacker could supply a path that would allow them to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user could leverage this vulnerability to load arbitrary internal files ending with the `.pbf` extension from the Kibana host. This would allow the attacker to read potentially sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed over the network.
*   A malicious user can supply a manipulated path while requesting `.pbf` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have low-level privileges to interact with the Kibana application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Kibana server.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Kibana versions 7.9.0 through 7.14.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Kibana version 7.14.1, where the path validation issue is fixed.
