**Kibana code execution issue (ESA-2021-21)**

It was discovered that a user with fleet admin permissions could upload a malicious package. Due to using an older version of the js-yaml library, this package would be loaded in an insecure manner, allowing an attacker to execute commands on the kibana server.

**Affected Versions:**

Kibana versions 7.10.2 through 7.14.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 7.14.1

**CVSSv3:** 6.6 - AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22150

---

**Kibana path traversal issue (ESA-2021-22)**

It was discovered that Kibana was not validating a user supplied path, which would load .pbf files. Because of this, a malicious user could arbitrarily traverse the Kibana host to load internal files ending in the .pbf extension.

Thanks to Luat Nguyen of CyberJutsu for reporting this issue.

**Affected Versions:**

Kibana versions 7.9.0 through 7.14.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 7.14.1

**CVSSv3:** 3.1 - AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22151

---

**Kibana html injection issue (ESA-2021-23)**

It was discovered that kibana was not sanitizing document fields containing html snippets. Using this vulnerability, an attacker with the ability to write documents to an Elasticsearch index could inject HTML. When the Discover app highlighted a search term containing the HTML, it would be rendered for the user.

**Affected Versions:**

Kibana version 7.14.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users can set “doc\_table:highlight” to “false” in the Kibana Advanced Settings. Users who do not wish to do this, and are currently on version 7.14.0 should upgrade to version 7.14.1.

**CVSSv3:** 4.3 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37936

---

**Kibana Node.js security vulnerabilities (ESA-2021-24)**

Node.js version 14.17.3 is affected by several security vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-22940, CVE-2021-3672, CVE-2021-22931, and CVE-2021-22939. We do not believe an attacker can exploit these against Kibana, but we are upgrading Node.js out of an abundance of caution. Kibana 7.14.1 upgrades Node.js to version 14.17.5 to resolve these issues.

**Affected Versions:**

Kibana versions before 7.14.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 7.14.1

**CVSSv3:**

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22940, CVE-2021-3672, CVE-2021-22931, CVE-2021-22939

---

**Elasticsearch privilege escalation issue (ESA-2021-25)**

An issue was found with how API keys are created with the fleet-server service account. When an API key is created with a service account, it is possible that the API key could be created with higher privileges than intended. Using this vulnerability, a compromised fleet-server service account could escalate themselves to a super-user.

**Affected Versions:**

Elasticsearch versions from 7.13.0 through 7.14.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 7.14.1

**CVSSv3:** 5.9 - AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37937

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
