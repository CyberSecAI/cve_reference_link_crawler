Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-3131:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of FortiOS. This results in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which can be exploited in several locations within the FortiOS web interface.
    - Specifically, the identified vulnerable areas include:
        - The "Applications" section within the Fortiview.
        - The "Assign Token" functionality.
        - The "Replacement Messages" configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Execution of unauthorized code or commands:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the affected FortiOS web interface.
- **Potential for account compromise:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, credentials, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Privilege escalation:** An attacker may be able to escalate privileges if a high-privilege user is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of FortiOS.
    - **Applications Section:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the URL targeting the application view within Fortiview.
        - **Example URL:** `https://192.168.1.99/ng/fortiview/app/15832" onmouseover=alert('XSS') x="y`
    - **Assign Token:** The attacker injects malicious scripts via the "action" parameter of the URL when activating a token for a user.
        - **Example URL:** `https://192.168.1.99/p/user/ftoken/activate/user/guest/?action=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3E`
    - **Replacement Messages:** The attacker injects malicious script through the buffer parameter when editing replacement messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the FortiOS device's web interface.
- **User interaction:** While some vulnerabilities might not require a direct click (e.g., reflected XSS), a user with access to the FortiOS web interface must visit the malicious URL.  The "Replacement Messages" vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that once the malicious script is injected, it will persist in the system and affect other users visiting that part of the GUI.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL parameters or input fields that are vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit-db content provides specific examples of HTTP requests and responses illustrating the vulnerabilities, which helps to understand the technical details of the attacks.
-  The provided data includes specific URLs and parameters that can be used to trigger the vulnerabilities, which can be used to test and verify the presence of the vulnerability.
-  The vulnerabilities were discovered by Patryk Bogdan of Secorda.
-  Fortinet provided a fix for this vulnerability in FortiOS version 5.6.1.
