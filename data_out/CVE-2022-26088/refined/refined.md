Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when forwarding incidents via email. Specifically, the "To:" field of the email editor allows for the injection of a limited set of HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTML Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize the "To:" field input, allowing an attacker to inject HTML code.
- Limited HTML Filtering Bypass: Although there is a filtering mechanism to prevent the injection of many HTML tags (e.g., `<script>`) and event handlers, it can be bypassed using the `<img>` tag with an arbitrary `src` attribute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): By injecting an image tag with a malicious URL, an attacker can force the user's browser to make requests to attacker-controlled internal services, potentially triggering unauthorized actions.
- Information Exfiltration: By embedding a URL in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag, an attacker can force a user's browser to send requests to the attacker's server, potentially revealing the user's IP address or other sensitive information via the request headers.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email forwarding: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker with the ability to forward incidents through email from the web interface.
-  Manipulated Request: The attacker intercepts the request to send an email and modifies the 'Email.To.InternetEmail' parameter to inject the HTML payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the BMC Remedy ITSM-Suite.
- Ability to forward incidents: The attacker must have the necessary permissions to forward incidents via email from the web interface.
- Intercept Request: The attacker needs to be able to intercept the HTTP request to modify the Email.To.InternetEmail field.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on the number of recipients in the activity log, which then loads and executes the injected HTML code.
- The vendor initially downplayed the impact of this vulnerability, stating it was 'informative' and not demonstrating a real impact. However, the researchers clarified that the vulnerability could be used to trigger CSRF attacks on other internal services and exfiltrate information.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 22.1 of the software.
