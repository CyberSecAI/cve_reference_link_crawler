The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26933.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A deadlock can occur in the Linux kernel's USB core driver when accessing the "disable" sysfs attribute of a USB port. The `disable_show` and `disable_store` callback routines acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub. Simultaneously, another process might lock the hub to remove it or change its configuration. This results in a deadlock because the removal process waits for sysfs attribute callbacks to return, while the callbacks are waiting to acquire the lock held by the removal process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition arising from the acquisition of locks in the sysfs attribute callbacks and the hub removal/configuration process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System freeze:** The deadlock prevents the affected process from completing its operations and results in system freeze, requiring a reboot to recover.
- **Denial of service:** The system freeze effectively constitutes a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Concurrent access:** The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent access to the sysfs "disable" attribute of a USB port while simultaneously attempting to remove or reconfigure the parent USB hub.
- **Sysfs interaction:** Exploitation involves interacting with the sysfs interface related to USB devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to interact with sysfs and trigger the deadlock.
- **Concurrent operations:** The attacker must be able to trigger concurrent operations involving both the USB hub removal/configuration process and access to the "disable" attribute via sysfs.
