- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the file system in Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) 5.24.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Default Permissions
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with low privileges can gain write access to unauthorized data and cause a version update failure condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, low privilege attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges on the local system to access the file system. The attacker needs to be able to write to unauthorized data which will lead to a version update failure condition.
