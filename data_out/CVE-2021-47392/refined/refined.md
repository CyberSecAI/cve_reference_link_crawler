Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a failure in the `cma_listen_on_all()` function within the Linux kernel's RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) Connection Manager (cma) module. When `cma_listen_on_all()` fails, it doesn't properly clean up the per-device IDs which remain on the `listen_list`. The state of these IDs is not set to `RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Resource Leak:** The per-device IDs are left on the `listen_list` and their refcounts are not decremented upon error, leading to a resource leak.
- **Incorrect State:** The per-device IDs' state is not set to `RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND`, causing `cma_cancel_listens()` to not be called during cmid destruction.
- **Deadlock:** Due to the resource leak and incorrect state, the per-device IDs keep holding the refcount, preventing the ID from being destroyed, leading to a deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A deadlock occurs which causes the system to become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a failure in the RDMA connection establishment process specifically in the `cma_listen_on_all` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to trigger a failure in the `cma_listen_on_all()` function, which likely involves interacting with the RDMA subsystem in a way that causes the listening process to fail.
