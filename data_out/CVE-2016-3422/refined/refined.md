Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The provided information indicates that CVE-2016-3422 is an unspecified vulnerability within the 2D component of Oracle JDK, fixed in versions 6u115, 7u101, and 8u91. The root cause is not further specified in these documents, as they are mainly advisory notifications for patching the vulnerability, rather than detailed vulnerability analysis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unspecified 2D component vulnerability in Oracle JDK.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution (likely, based on RedHat's 'critical' rating)
- Unspecified impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, potentially leading to unauthorized read or modification of data accessible to the Java process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks exploiting the unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component.
- Exploitation is often done using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or Java applets. However some exploits may be possible without these specific attack vectors when the vulnerability is triggered via an API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   Remote network access to the vulnerable system.
-   Ability to trigger the vulnerability via a malicious Java applet, Java Web Start application, or a direct API call.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IBM Java and Oracle Java versions.
*   Multiple vendors are affected including Red Hat, SUSE, and NetApp.
*   Patching is strongly advised by all vendors.
*   Some documents mention the issue could lead to denial of service.
*  Some vendors flag it as a critical issue (RedHat), while others do not (SUSE).

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3422 is a critical vulnerability stemming from a flaw in the 2D component of Oracle JDK and other affected IBM JDK versions. Although the specific details of the vulnerability are not specified, its exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution and other security breaches. Network-based exploitation via malicious Java applets, Java Web Start applications, or API calls is possible. Affected users are recommended to upgrade their respective Java instances to the specified fixed versions as soon as possible.
