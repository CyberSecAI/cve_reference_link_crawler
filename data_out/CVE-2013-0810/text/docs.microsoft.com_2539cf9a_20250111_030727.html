## Update FAQ

**After installing the update, when I apply a custom theme, the associated screensaver is not automatically selected. Instead, the Screen saver selection is set to "Blank". How can I apply the screensaver associated with my custom theme?**

With this update, screen savers associated with custom themes that were not delivered in-box are not automatically selected when a custom theme is applied. This behavior was designed into the update to help make your system more secure. If you want to apply a custom screen saver that is known to be secure, right-click the .scr file and select **Install**, or use Group Policy to apply the screen saver selection on multiple systems.

**What is defense-in-depth?**

In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.

## Windows Theme File Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2013-0810

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected editions of Microsoft Windows handles certain specially crafted Windows theme files. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if the attacker convinces a user to apply a specially crafted Windows theme. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-0810](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-0810).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In all cases, a user cannot be forced to open the file or apply the theme; for an attack to be successful, a user must be convinced to do so.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open Windows theme files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Windows improperly handles theme and screensaver files.

**What is** **a Windows theme?**

In Microsoft Windows, themes are a combination of personalization settings that change how your desktop looks and sounds. Themes can simultaneously change the desktop background, window border color, sounds, and screen saver on your Windows PC. Users can switch between themes and can create, and share, personalized themes.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If the current user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

In an attack scenario, an attacker could convince a user to open a specially crafted theme file containing a specially crafted screensaver that executes arbitrary code when the user applies the Windows theme.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how Windows handles theme files and screensavers.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**
