- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Reusing a nonce or key pair in encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication due to the reuse of cryptographic material.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data and resources, although specific details about the impact are not provided.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described, but it involves exploiting a weakness in authentication due to the reuse of a nonce or key pair in encryption.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the affected system in a way that triggers the cryptographic operation with the reused nonce or key pair.
