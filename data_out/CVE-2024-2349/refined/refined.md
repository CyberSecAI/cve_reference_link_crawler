- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Fancy Elementor Flipbox widget.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected code. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the Fancy Elementor Flipbox widget. Specifically, an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to inject the malicious script via the widget.
