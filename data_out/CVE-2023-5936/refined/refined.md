- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a temporary file with unsafe privileges within the Arc application on Unix systems (Linux, MacOS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is an "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource" (CWE-732), where the temporary file's permissions are not sufficiently restrictive.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can manipulate the temporary file to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have a local account on the system where Arc is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to tamper with the temporary file, implying they must have at least low privileges on the system. Additionally, user interaction is classified as not required for CVSS v3.1, implying the attack can be carried out without further interaction from other users after gaining initial local access.
