{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Ray Dashboard API is affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the `url` parameter of the `/log_proxy` API endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
       "CWE-441",
       "CWE-918"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to proxy any HTTP or HTTPS request through the Ray API. This includes retrieving highly privileged IAM credentials required by Ray from the AWS metadata API. If successful, an attacker can modify existing EC2 instances to gain unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted request to the `/log_proxy` endpoint with a malicious URL in the `url` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the Ray Dashboard port (default TCP port 8265) and does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability."
