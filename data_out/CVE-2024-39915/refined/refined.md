Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `url` parameter when generating PDF reports within the Thruk web application. The application directly passes the URL, without sufficient sanitization, to a shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection. The `url` parameter is directly embedded into a shell command executed by the `html2pdf.sh` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands via the URL.
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `url` parameter before using it in the shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where Thruk is running.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the user running the Thruk application, the attacker could gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Thruk application.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the reporting functionality within Thruk.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code into the `url` parameter when creating or regenerating a PDF report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Thruk system.
- The attacker needs to have access to the reporting features of Thruk to create/regenerate a report with a custom URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with malicious URLs.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in versions of Thruk up to and including 3.15.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 3.16.
- The vulnerable code is located in `plugins/plugins-available/reports2/lib/Thruk/Utils/Reports/Render.pm`.
- The patch involves escaping the URL before passing it to the shell command, preventing command injection. Specifically, instead of calling `Thruk::Utils::IO::cmd($cmd);` it now calls `Thruk::Utils::IO::cmd($c, [$c->config->{home}.'/script/html2pdf.sh', $url, $c->stash->{'attachment'}.'.pdf']);`, which avoids spawning a shell.

This vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 10.0 due to the potential for unauthenticated RCE. The detailed CVSS metrics are: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
