The provided content is related to CVE-2024-1701.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a combination of SQL injection and broken access control in the `/edit.php` component of the PHP-MYSQL user login system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the username update functionality. An attacker can inject SQL code into the username field.
* **Broken Access Control:** Due to the SQL injection, an attacker can bypass access control mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify user data, including usernames. The provided proof of concept shows that by injecting `' #` into the username field, an attacker can update all usernames in the database.
*   **Account Takeovers:** Attackers may be able to change passwords of other users and take over their accounts.
*  **Compromised Data:** The vulnerability can lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive user data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is performed through the web application's user interface.
*   Specifically, the username update feature in `/edit.php` is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the application with the ability to update their profile details.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate input fields that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
