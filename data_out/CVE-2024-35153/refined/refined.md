- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the administrative console of IBM WebSphere Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability, allowing potential injection of malicious scripts into the administrative console.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of the administrative console, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the administrative console, suggesting that the attacker needs to be able to reach the administrative console interface either by being an authenticated user or by somehow reaching it as a public/unauthenticated user
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into fields or parameters that are displayed within the administrative console interface. This might require an authenticated user session or, if the console is accessible to unauthenticated users, an ability to interact with it without prior authentication.
