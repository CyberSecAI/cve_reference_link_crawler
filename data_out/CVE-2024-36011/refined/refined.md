The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36011.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a potential null-pointer dereference in the `hci_le_big_sync_established_evt` function within the Linux kernel's Bluetooth HCI event handling code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `hci_le_big_sync_established_evt` function iterates through a list of handles, looking up the corresponding `bis` (Bluetooth Isochronous Stream) connection using `hci_conn_hash_lookup_handle`.
- If `hci_conn_hash_lookup_handle` returns NULL (meaning a `bis` connection with the given handle is not found), the code proceeds to dereference the `bis` pointer without checking for NULL.
- This dereference leads to a null-pointer dereference, which could crash the kernel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The immediate impact is a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious Bluetooth device could send crafted HCI events, triggering the vulnerable code path in `hci_le_big_sync_established_evt`, where a handle refers to a non-existent `bis` connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the vulnerable system via Bluetooth to send specific HCI events. This implies a local or close-proximity attacker.
