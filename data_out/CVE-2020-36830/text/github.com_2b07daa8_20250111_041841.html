### User Comments:

### üìä Metadata \*

#### Bounty URL: <https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-urlregex>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Description \*

Implemented a different regex engine that is not vulnerable to the same ReDoS attacks caused by catastrophic backtracking.

### üíª Technical Description \*

From the readme in Google's [repo](https://github.com/google/re2):

> RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++ library.

Unlike the native NodeJS regex engine, which is vulnerable to denial of service attacks when a malicious user supplies a very long URL, `RE2` lacks the backreference and lookahead capabilities required for this attack, making it safer to use on user supplied input. Given that this package does not accept user supplied regular expressions, and the existing regex was not making use of these operations, I imported the Node bindings for `RE2`, which use almost identical syntax to the native `RegExp`.

More information about the Node bindings can be found [here](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2).

I understand that the purpose of this package may have been to remain free of dependencies, but I believe that using a regex engine without these capabilities is the right solution, especially given that the dangerous features were not being used.

### üêõ Proof of Concept (PoC) \*

```
const urlRegex = require("urlregex");
const isValid = urlRegex().test(
  "http://huntr.devtestvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321.testvulnerability2312321"
);

console.log(isValid);

```
