```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Command injection flaw",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application is vulnerable to command injection, allowing the execution of arbitrary OS commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to a complete system takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to be authenticated to the application.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the vulnerable application to exploit the command injection flaw. The attack is considered to have a high level of complexity due to the required authentication and the need to craft malicious input."
