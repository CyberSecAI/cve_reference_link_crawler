Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect OIDC cookie expiration time being used by Octopus Server. This resulted in cookies potentially using their maximum lifespan instead of a shorter, more secure expiration period.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient Session Expiration: OIDC cookies were not being configured with appropriate expiration times.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is described as low severity.  While the advisory doesn't specify the exact consequences, extended session lifespan could allow an attacker who has gained access to a user's session cookie to maintain access for an extended period, increasing the window of opportunity for malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit a compromised user's OIDC session cookie that has not expired.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to a valid, unexpired OIDC session cookie. This might involve malware on a user's system, social engineering, or other methods of cookie theft.

**Affected Versions:**
The following Octopus Server versions are affected:
* ALL 2022.4.x versions after 2022.4.8332
* All 2023.x versions
* All 2024.1.x versions before 2024.1.12931
* All 2024.2.x versions before 2024.2.9313
