Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `title` field when saving a quiz via the `/ajax.php?action=save_quiz` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize the `title` parameter when saving a quiz which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Escalation of Privileges:** The injected XSS payload can be used to perform actions as the victim user, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or modification.
  - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to a wide range of malicious activities, such as redirecting the user to a phishing site or stealing cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted POST request to the `/ajax.php?action=save_quiz` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `title` parameter within the multipart/form-data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
  - **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application, as indicated by the presence of `Cookie` headers in the provided Proof-of-Concept (POC).
  - **Knowledge of the API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the `ajax.php?action=save_quiz` endpoint and how to send data using multipart/form-data format.
