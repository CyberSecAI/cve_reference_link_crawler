| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c0)  Michal Findra    2024-08-16 09:09:20 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Undertow where the ProxyProtocolReadListener reuses the same StringBuilder instance across multiple requests. This occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 17:17:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.2 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:6508 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6508](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6508)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-19 16:47:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 3.20.7 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:6883 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6883](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6883)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-01 07:52:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:7441 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7441](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A7441)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-01 07:54:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:7442 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7442](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A7442)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-07 12:18:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:7735 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7735](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A7735)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-07 12:46:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:7736 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7736](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A7736)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2305290#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-12 20:00:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    HawtIO 4.0.0 for Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4  Via RHSA-2024:11023 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:11023](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A11023)   ``` |  |
