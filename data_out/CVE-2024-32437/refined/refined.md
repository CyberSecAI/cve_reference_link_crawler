    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A successful CSRF attack would involve tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that submits a forged request to the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress plugin to perform an action, such as clicking a link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site."
