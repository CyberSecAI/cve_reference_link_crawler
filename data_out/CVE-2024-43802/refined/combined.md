# heap-buffer-overflow in ins\_typebuf() in Vim < 9.1.0697

Moderate

GHSA-4ghr-c62x-cqfh
Aug 25, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< v9.1.0697

## Patched versions

v9.1.0697

## Description

# heap-buffer-overflow in ins\_typebuf() in Vim < 9.1.0697

**Date**: 25.08.2024

**Severity**: Low

**CVE**: not-yet-assigned

**CWE**: Heap-based buffer overlow (CWE-122)

### Summary

heap-buffer-overflow in ins\_typebuf() in Vim < 9.1.0697

### Impact

When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in

the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space

left in the buffer to handle the next characters. So this may lead to

the tb\_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the

valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow

in e.g. ins\_typebuf().

Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough

space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush

current typebuf contents.

It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to

happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the

typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it

may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size.

Impact is low since it is not easily reproducable and requires to have

several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this

happens, this will cause a crash.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting

this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
