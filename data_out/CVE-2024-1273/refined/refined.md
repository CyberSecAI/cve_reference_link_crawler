**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Successful exploitation can lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
  - The attack vector is through user input parameters in the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - An attacker with Contributor or higher role access to the WordPress site is required to exploit this vulnerability.
