The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the `dell-smbios-wmi` driver in the Linux kernel, which is identified by the commit ID `3a53587423d25c87af4b4126a806a0575104b45e`. This bug fix was subsequently backported to stable branches through other commits. The core issue and fix are the same across all commits.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `init_dell_smbios_wmi()` function only registers the `dell_smbios_wmi_driver` on systems where the Dell WMI interface is supported. However, the `exit_dell_smbios_wmi()` function unconditionally unregisters the driver. This inconsistency leads to a kernel oops when the module is removed on systems where the Dell WMI interface is not present, because the driver was never registered in the first place.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unconditional driver unregister in `exit_dell_smbios_wmi()` without checking if the driver was actually registered.
- Potential for a kernel oops (panic) when unloading the `dell_smbios` module on systems without the Dell WMI interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel oops (panic) upon unloading the `dell_smbios` module when the Dell WMI interface is not present, causing system instability.
- Potential for denial of service by repeatedly loading and unloading the module.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unloading the `dell_smbios` kernel module via the `rmmod` command or a similar mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to unload kernel modules, which usually requires root or administrator privileges.
