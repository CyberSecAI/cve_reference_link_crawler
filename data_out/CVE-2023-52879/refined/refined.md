  "CVE-2023-52879": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Linux kernel tracing subsystem. When a kprobe event is created, a trace_event_file structure is allocated to represent the file in tracefs associated with the event. This structure maintains the state of the event. When the kprobe event is deleted, the tracefs file is also removed, which leads to freeing the trace_event_file structure. However, if a user-space process still holds a file descriptor to the enable file of the deleted kprobe event, the file descriptor is not fully removed. When the user-space process closes or writes to that file descriptor, it will try to dereference the already freed trace_event_file structure, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating tracefs files by creating kprobe events, opening file descriptors to the event's enable file, and then deleting the kprobe event while keeping file descriptors open.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the tracefs file system, which typically requires some privileges. Specifically, the ability to create kprobe events and open file descriptors within tracefs is necessary."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel tracing subsystem"
    ],
    "fix": "The fix involves adding a reference count to the trace_event_file structure. The structure will not be freed until the last reference is released. A new flag named 'FREED' is also added. This flag will be set when the event is removed, which prevents further modifications to that event even when there are outstanding file descriptor references.",
    "patch_details": [
      "A reference count `ref` is added to the `trace_event_file` structure.",
      "A `FREED` flag is added to the `flags` field of the `trace_event_file` structure.",
      "`event_file_get` and `event_file_put` functions are added to manage the reference count.",
      "The `tracing_open_file_tr` function is updated to acquire a reference to `trace_event_file` and check if the file is marked for removal (FREED flag is set)",
     "The `tracing_release_file_tr` function is updated to release the reference to the trace_event_file structure.",
      "The `remove_event_file_dir` function is updated to set the `FREED` flag before releasing the reference to the trace_event_file structure."
