# JVN#02030803 ORC vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow

## Overview

ORC provided by GStreamer contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* ORC versions prior to 0.4.39

## Description

ORC provided by GStreamer is typically used when developing GStreamer plugins. Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability ([CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)) exists in `orcparse.c` of ORC.
