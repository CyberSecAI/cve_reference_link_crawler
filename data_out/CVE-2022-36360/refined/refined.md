- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected Siemens LOGO! 8 BM devices load firmware updates without properly checking their authenticity. The integrity of the unencrypted firmware is verified using a non-cryptographic method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345) when loading firmware updates, and usage of a non-cryptographic method to verify the integrity of the firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could manipulate a firmware update and flash it to the device. This could potentially lead to a compromise of the device's functionality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access (AV:P) to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device to be able to flash the manipulated firmware. No specific privileges are required (PR:N) and no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
