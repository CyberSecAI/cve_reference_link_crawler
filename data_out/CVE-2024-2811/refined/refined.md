Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formWifiWpsStart` function of the Tenda AC15 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formWifiWpsStart` function receives an `index` parameter from a POST request.
- The `index` parameter value is used directly in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking.
- The output of `sprintf` is written to a local variable on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is large enough.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Overwriting the return address on the stack allows an attacker to redirect code execution to an arbitrary location.
- This can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a POST request to the `/goform/WifiWpsStart` endpoint.
- The attacker controls the content of the `index` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Tenda AC15 router.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request containing an oversized value for the `index` parameter.
- No authentication is mentioned in the description and the attack appears to be able to be carried out without any authentication required.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a proof-of-concept (POC) Python script that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a POST request with a large value for the `index` parameter.
- The content mentions the affected version is "AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi".
