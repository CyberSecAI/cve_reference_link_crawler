# GeoJSON URL validation can expose server files and environment variables to unauthorized users

Critical

[rlotun](/rlotun)
published
GHSA-w73v-6p7p-fpfr
Oct 5, 2021

## Package

OSS and EE
(Metabase)

## Affected versions

x.40.0, x.40.1, x.40.2, x.40.3, x.40.4

## Patched versions

x.40.5, x.41

## Description

### Impact

We've discovered a potential security issue with the custom GeoJSON map (`admin->settings->maps->custom maps->add a map`) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment variables). Only versions x.40.0-x.40.4 are affected.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in a new maintenance release (0.40.5 and 1.40.5), and any subsequent release after that (including x.41+).

### Workarounds

If you’re on an affected version (x.40.0-x.40.4), upgrade immediately.

If you’re unable to upgrade immediately, you can mitigate this by including rules in your reverse proxy or load balancer or WAF. Here are examples for ALB and Nginx, though it is recommended to block the endpoint /api/geojson completely:

ALB:

```
    Path containing /api/geojson
    Query string of url is starting with "file:" or "http://169.254.169.254"
    Return fixed response 403

```

Nginx:

```
location ~* /api/geojson {
  if ($args ~* "(^|&)url=(%|file|http.+169\.254\.\d+\.\d+)" ) {
    add_header Content-Type text/plain always;
    return 403 "File URIs and Metadata API URL are forbidden.";
  }
  rewrite ^(.*)$ $1 break;
  try_files $uri @metabase;
}

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
