### [A perfect Elementor Breadcrumbs for dynamic pages](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-perfect-elementor-breadcrumbs-for-dynamic-pages/)

I looked for some flexible breadcrumbs widget until I found this plugin and it appeared to match 100% of my needs. But the problem is that the plugin seems to be outdated to work correctly with the latest version of Elementor. Will be waiting for the working version. Thanks.
