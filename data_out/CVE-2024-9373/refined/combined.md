I looked for some flexible breadcrumbs widget until I found this plugin and it appeared to match 100% of my needs. But the problem is that the plugin seems to be outdated to work correctly with the latest version of Elementor. Will be waiting for the working version. Thanks.

### Description

The Elemenda plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
