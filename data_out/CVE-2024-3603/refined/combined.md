### Description

The OSM – OpenStreetMap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'osm\_map' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'theme'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

!! IMPORTANT !!

The WordPress Plugin Review Team required us to provide opt-in feature to display attribution since it is part of [WordPress Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#10-plugins-may-not-embed-external-links-or-credits-on-the-public-site-without-explicitly-asking-the-user%e2%80%99s-permission). So you have to enable the checkbox “Display attribution (credit) in the map.” at the WP OSM Plugin Shortcode generater or add the attribution manually to your map. Otherwise it may violate the map or data license, eg [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).

This plugin enables GPX and KML upload!

Licenses of the maps:

\* OpenStreetMap: [OpenStreetMap License](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

\* OpenTopoMap: [OpenTopoMap License](https://opentopomap.org/about)

\* Stamen Maps: [Stamen License](http://maps.stamen.com)

\* BaseMap: [BaseMap License](http://basemap.at)

\* Thunderforest (API key): [Thunderforest License](http://www.thunderforest.com/terms/)

\* Others: Depends on the map you are including – check it before including it!

## Installation

1. Upload OSM folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Generate the OSM shortcode when you write your post / page

IMPORTANT:

Personal data (eg. gpx files) must not be stored in the plugins/osm folder but in the upload folder!

## FAQ

### Do I need any key or any registration to show maps in my blog

No!

### I do not see my gpx file / marker file in the map ?

The file has to be located at the same adress as your blog.

There must be not format tag (like href …) in the shortcode.

What the title says, we have been using the plugin for over a year, and had issues with recent updates. After raising the issue, it was acknowledged and addressed in a few hours.
Our maps all show fine again, it looks great.

Wir benutzen OSM, um koordinatenmarkierte Beiträge auf Übersichtskarten zu zeigen, und um automatisch generierte Koordinatenlisten sowohl als Einzelpunkte als auch als Routen darzustellen. Funktioniert perfekt!
We’re using OSM to show geotagged articles on overview maps and to show automatically generated koordinate lists as points or as routes on maps. Works perfectly!
