### Description

The ImagePress – Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ip\_delete\_post' and 'ip\_update\_post\_title' functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts and update post titles.
