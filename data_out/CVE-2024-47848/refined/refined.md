Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the PageTriage extension where blocked users were still able to review or unreview articles. This was a regression introduced by a previous change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization/Authentication:** The core issue is that the PageTriage extension was not properly checking if a user was blocked before allowing them to perform review/unreview actions. This implies a failure to correctly implement authorization controls for these specific actions.
- **Logic Error:** The original code logic did not correctly account for blocked users who also had the autopatrolled or patroller rights, which were checked after the block check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Block Mechanism:** Blocked users could bypass the intended block restrictions, which undermines the purpose of user blocking functionality.
- **Potential for Misuse:** Malicious blocked users could potentially abuse the ability to review or unreview articles, disrupting content management workflows or causing other problems on a wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A blocked user with patroller or autopatroller permissions would be able to navigate to a page and use the PageTriage review functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be a user who has been blocked.
- The user would also need to have the patroller or autopatrolled permissions.
- The attacker needs to be logged into the system.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability resided in the `ApiPageTriageAction.php` file within the `PageTriage` extension. The patch fixed this issue by adding a check for blocked users before any other permission checks to prevent blocked users from performing review/unreview actions. Specifically, the fix includes the following changes:

- Added a check using  `$patrolPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` and `$autopatrolledPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` to determine if the user is blocked.
- If blocked the function `dieBlocked()` is called, and the function exits, thus not allowing the user to proceed with any reviewing or unreviewing actions.
- The logic was updated for clarity and readability, by checking for the block status before the role checks.

The fix was applied to the master, REL1_42, and wmf/1.43.0-wmf.28 branches of the PageTriage extension.
