# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact miroslav.pejic.85@gmail.com directly. Please refrain from directly creating a GitHub issue and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause problem.

Your report should include:

* Product version ([GitHub](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu/commits/main) commit hash or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mirotalk/sfu) sha256 digest hash)
* The affected component if possible (RoomClient.js, Server.js, etc.)
* A vulnerability description
* Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thanks in advance for your support to make our products safer!
