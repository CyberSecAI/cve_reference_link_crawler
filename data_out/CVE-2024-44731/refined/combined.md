# Schwachstellen in Videokonferenzsystemen

Aktualisiert am 14/10/2024

Videokonferenzsysteme sind spätestens nach Corona ein fester Bestandteil des Arbeitslebens. Neben bekannten Vertretern wie Zoom, Microsoft Teams und Google Meet, finden auch Open-Source Varianten wie BigBlueButton mehr Bekanntheit. Open-Source-Software bieten die Vorteile der eigenen Datenhoheit und öffentlich zugänglichen Quellcode, der es Sicherheitsforschern erlaubt eine Quellcode-Analyse durchzuführen, um die Projekte sicherer zu machen.

## Schwachstellen bei MiroTalk

Eines der Open-Source Videokonferenzsysteme ist MiroTalk. MiroTalk präsentiert sich als [Open-Source](https://aware7.com/de/blog/was-ist-open-source-intelligence/) WebRTC-basierte Plattform, die es Teilnehmern ermöglicht in Echtzeit über Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Videokonferenzen abzuhalten. Dabei werden besonders die Merkmale “Einfachheit, Sicherheit und Geschwindigkeit” hervorgehoben. Zusätzlich unterstützt MiroTalk viele Features, wie zum Beispiel Screensharing, die Nutzung von Whiteboards und verschlüsselte Videoanrufe.

Das Projekt hat, Stand Oktober 2024, 3.000 Sterne auf GitHub und ist somit recht populär. Es werden auch andere Versionen angeboten, wie z.B. MiroTalk SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit), welches für große Meetings ausgelegt ist.

Im Folgenden präsentieren wir einige Schwachstellen im Open-Source Videokonferenzsystem MiroTalk, welche wir im April 2023 gefunden haben. Die Schwachstellen wurden sofort dem Entwickler gemeldet, sofort bestätigt und innerhalb weniger Tage behoben. Die präsentierten Schwachstellen haben die folgenden CVEs zugewiesen bekommen: [CVE-2024-44729](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44729), [CVE-2024-44730](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44730), [CVE-2024-44731](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44731), und [CVE-2024-44734](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44734).

## **CVE-2024-44729**

**Anfällige Version:** [Commit [3440a6a]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/tree/3440a6aafbb4fe2ff0a85fb34d9a95b05c5bc874) (April 13, 2023)

**Behobene Version:** [Commit [9de226]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/commit/9de226235113343e8ccaf0df3dbb9871a9221e30) (April 22, 2023)

Die erste Schwachstelle erlaubt es durch fehlende Zugriffskontrolle das Entfernen von beliebigen Nutzern aus beliebigen Meetings.  Das Entfernen von Teilnehmern ist ein essenzielles Sicherheitsfeature in Videokonferenzsystemen. Es sollte aber nur höher privilegierten Teilnehmern zur Verfügung stehen, andere Teilnehmer zu entfernen.  Jedoch kann ein Angreifer, welcher nicht Teil des Meetings sein muss, beliebige Teilnehmer aus beliebigen Meetings entfernen. Der Angreifer muss nur die Peer ID des jeweiligen Nutzers kennen und eine WebSocket-Verbindung zum Server haben. Alle Peer IDs sind Meeting-Teilnehmern bekannt. Somit kann ein Angreifer, der im Meeting war und entfernt wurde, alle Teilnehmer hinauswerfen. Eine alternative Möglichkeit ist alle Teilnehmer auf einmal zu entfernen. Dafür muss nur die Room ID bekannt sein. Das führt dazu, dass Meetings unterbrochen werden oder nicht stattfinden können.

## **CVE-2024-44730**

**Anfällige Version**: [Commit [3440a6a]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/tree/3440a6aafbb4fe2ff0a85fb34d9a95b05c5bc874) (April 13, 2023)

**Behobene Version**: [Commit [c21d58]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/commit/c21d581814badb106a267cefab3465ec9db5f499) (April 25, 2023)

Die anfällige Version erlaubt es Angreifern Chat-Nachrichten zu manipulieren. Das führt zu einer Vielzahl von Angriffen. CVE-2024-44730 beschreibt einen Angriff, der es einem Angreifer erlaubt Nachrichten zu verfassen und einen beliebigen Absender anzugeben. Der Server ist bei Chat-Nachrichten nicht beteiligt, da der Chat über RTC funktioniert. Somit kommunizieren die Browser bei Chat-Nachrichten untereinander und müssen clientseitig die Identitäten der Nutzer sicherstellen. Somit muss der Angreifer im Meeting sein, damit eine RTC-Verbindung zu den anderen Browsern hergestellt ist.

## **CVE-2024-44731**

**Anfällige Version:** [Commit [3440a6a]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/tree/3440a6aafbb4fe2ff0a85fb34d9a95b05c5bc874) (April 13, 2023)
**Behobene Version**: [Commit [9de226]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/commit/9de226235113343e8ccaf0df3dbb9871a9221e30) (April 22, 2023)

CVE-2024-44731 beschreibt ebenfalls eine Chat-Manipulation, die zu einer DOM XSS-Schwachstelle führt. Die Nachricht wird direkt über die RPC-Verbindung an die anderen Teilnehmer gesendet und der Angreifer-Code wird beim Einfügen in den DOM ausgeführt. Falls der Angreifer den Code nicht eintippen möchte, kann auch das Speech-to-Text-Feature genutzt werden, um den Schadcode an Teilnehmer zu senden. Die Auswirkungen sind abhängig von dem Payload, den der Angreifer nutzt. Der Angreifer könnte auf die WebRTC-Einstellungen anderer Teilnehmer zugreifen. Da der Angreifer eine RTC-Verbindung aufgebaut haben muss, muss der Angreifer im Meeting sein.

## **CVE-2024-44734**

**Anfällige Version:** [Commit [3440a6a]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/tree/3440a6aafbb4fe2ff0a85fb34d9a95b05c5bc874) (April 13, 2023)

**Behobene Version:** [Commit [9de226]](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/commit/9de226235113343e8ccaf0df3dbb9871a9221e30) (April 22, 2023)

CVE-44723 ermöglicht das Ändern von Benutzernamen anderer Nutzer und des eigenen auf bereits vorhandene Benutzernamen. Änderungen der Benutzernamen werden über den Server über die WebSocket-Verbindung kommuniziert. Der Angreifer braucht nur die Room ID und den aktuellen Namen des Ziels und kann einen neuen Namen angeben. Für die WebSocket-Verbindung muss der Angreifer nicht in dem Raum des Ziels sein. Ehemalige Meeting-Teilnehmer können somit auch diesen Angriff durchführen. Beim Ändern des Namens informiert der Server alle Teilnehmer, bis auf den Teilnehmer, dessen Name geändert wurde. Somit fällt dem Ziel die Änderung des eigenen Namens nicht auf.

Die zweite Variante ist das Ändern des eigenen Namens. Bevor man den eigenen Namen ändert, wird eine Anfrage an den Server gestellt, wo geprüft wird, ob der Name bereits existiert. Die Funktion der Prüfung des Namens lässt sich überschreiben und führt dazu, dass den Namen einer anderen Person im Meeting annehmen kann und sich somit als eine andere Person ausgeben kann. Für diese Variante braucht der Angreifer ebenfalls nur die Room ID und den Namen des Nutzers.

## Gemeinsam gegen Schwachstellen

Transparenz und Sicherheit sind einige wichtige Aspekte von Open-Source-Software. Diese Aspekte sind jedoch nur gegeben, wenn Sicherheitsforscher die Software auch analysieren. Wir freuen uns der Open-Source-Community etwas zurückzugeben, indem wir die Software auf Schwachstellen untersuchen.

Wir danken dem Entwickler Miroslav Pejc für die schnelle Antwort und die angenehme Zusammenarbeit.

Seit 2020 bin ich in der IT-Sicherheitsbranche tätig, wo ich begann, mein Wissen an andere zu vermitteln. Nach meinem abgeschlossenen Masterstudium in IT-Sicherheit arbeitete ich als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter und veröffentlichte Paper in San Francisco und Abu Dhabi. Anschließend widmete ich mich Penetrationstests, um mein theoretisches Wissen praxisnah anzuwenden und weiter zu vertiefen.

# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact miroslav.pejic.85@gmail.com directly. Please refrain from directly creating a GitHub issue and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause problem.

Your report should include:

* Product version ([GitHub](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu/commits/main) commit hash or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mirotalk/sfu) sha256 digest hash)
* The affected component if possible (RoomClient.js, Server.js, etc.)
* A vulnerability description
* Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thanks in advance for your support to make our products safer!
