{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Gift Vouchers plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email containing a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, would execute an unwanted action on the vulnerable WordPress site. This exploits the trust the website has in the logged-in user's browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress site to visit a malicious link or page."
