Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36740:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-36740. The vulnerability is described as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass in the "Radio Buttons for Taxonomies" WordPress plugin, which is explicitly mentioned in the Wordfence vulnerability database entry and the NinTechNet blog posts.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing or incorrect nonce validation** in the `save_single_term()` function of the "Radio Buttons for Taxonomies" plugin. This means the plugin doesn't properly verify the authenticity of requests, allowing attackers to potentially perform actions on behalf of an administrator without their knowledge.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into making unintended requests.
-   **Missing/Incorrect Nonce Validation:** The code checks for the presence of a nonce before validating it. However, if the nonce parameter is missing, the validation is skipped.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can manipulate a logged-in administrator into saving terms, which can lead to data modification or other unintended consequences.
-   **Low to High Severity:** The impact can range from low to high, depending on how the saved terms are used within the site. It could potentially lead to XSS, settings changes, or data modification as stated in the blog.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
-   **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that, when executed by a logged-in administrator, would perform the unauthorized action.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick the administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a webpage containing the forged request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site.
-   **Requires User Interaction:** The attack requires the administrator to perform an action, such as clicking on a link provided by the attacker.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know which plugin and versions are vulnerable and the nonce used for the request.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `inc/class.WordPress_Radio_Taxonomy.php` in the plugin, before the fix was applied is:
    ```php
    if ( isset( $_POST["_radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}"]) && ! wp_verify_nonce( $_REQUEST["_radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}"], "radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}" ) )
       return $post_id;
    ```
    The issue here is that the nonce check is performed only if `$_POST["_radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}"]` is set, therefore if this variable is not set, the check will not occur.

*   The fix for this vulnerability, as indicated in the trac log is:
    ```php
    if ( ! isset( $_POST["_radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}"]) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_REQUEST["_radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}"], "radio_nonce-{$this->taxonomy}" ) ) {
        return $post_id;
    }
    ```
    The fix ensures that the nonce is checked regardless of whether the variable is set or not.

*   The Wordfence description confirms the vulnerability is due to "missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save\_single\_term() function."

**Additional Information:**
-   The blog posts from NinTechNet provide detailed examples of vulnerable nonce validation patterns found in other plugins, showing the common error of checking for a nonce's existence *before* validating it, rather than ensuring it's always checked.
-   The trac log on the WordPress plugins repository shows the code change that was made to address this specific vulnerability in the `radio-buttons-for-taxonomies` plugin.
-   Multiple blog posts from nintechnet.com outline multiple wordpress plugins vulnerable to the same CSRF vulnerability due to similar logic errors.

In summary, CVE-2020-36740 highlights a CSRF vulnerability in the "Radio Buttons for Taxonomies" WordPress plugin due to flawed nonce verification logic, which could be exploited by attackers through social engineering. The provided content clearly details the root cause, impact, and the necessary steps to remediate the issue, and the vulnerable code snippets as well as the fix for the vulnerability is provided.
