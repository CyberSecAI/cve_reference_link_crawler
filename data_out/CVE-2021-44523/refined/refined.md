Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-44523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The affected applications in both Siveillance Identity and SiPass Integrated "insufficiently limit the access to the internal activity feed database."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is that the applications do not properly restrict access to the internal activity feed database. This allows unauthorized access.
*   **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere:**  This is categorized as CWE-668, indicating that the resource (the activity feed database) is exposed to an unintended context or actor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can read, modify, or delete activity feed entries. This can lead to:
    *   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Reading activity feed entries exposes sensitive information.
    *   **Loss of Integrity:** Modification or deletion of entries can alter the recorded activities, potentially hiding malicious actions or creating false records.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate to the application.
*   **Network Access:**  The vulnerability is accessible through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected applications over the network.
*   No prior authentication is needed (unauthenticated remote attacker).

**Affected Products:**

*   Siveillance Identity (all versions before V1.6.284.0)
*   SiPass Integrated (all versions)

**CVSS Metrics:**
