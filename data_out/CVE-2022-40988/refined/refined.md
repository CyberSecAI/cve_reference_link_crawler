{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates where parameters are inserted into a stack buffer using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked size of input parameters in `sprintf` calls within the `DetranCLI` binary.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets to the device's `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have knowledge of the vulnerable command templates."
