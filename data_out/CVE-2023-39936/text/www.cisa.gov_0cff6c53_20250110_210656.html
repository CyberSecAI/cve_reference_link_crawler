## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Ashlar-Vellum products are affected:

* Cobalt: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior
* Graphite: v13.0.48 and prior
* Xenon: v12 SP0 Build (1204.77) and prior

### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

**3.2.1 [OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**

In Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, Xenon, Argon, Lithium, and Cobalt Share v12 SP0 Build (1204.77), the affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XE files. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2023-39427](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39427) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.2 [OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)**

In Ashlar-Vellum Graphite v13.0.48, the affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing VC6 files. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2023-39936](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-39936) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 3.4 RESEARCHER
