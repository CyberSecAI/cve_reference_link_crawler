- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WP Discourse plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute actions that should require higher privileges. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but it's implied that the vulnerability can be exploited through a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be a subscriber (unprivileged user).
