Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw within the draw.io integration of OpenOLAT. The application was parsing SVG files without properly sanitizing them, allowing for the inclusion of external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection. By manipulating HTTP requests, an attacker can inject malicious XML code into SVG files processed by the draw.io integration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server as the configured system user.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can potentially perform SSRF attacks, allowing them to interact with internal resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating HTTP requests when using the draw.io integration.
- **Malicious SVG files:** The attacker can include external entities in SVG files to trigger the XXE vulnerability during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the draw.io integration.
- Low privileges are required, but user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious SVG files to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `DrawioServiceImpl.java` file.
- The fix involves using the `XMLFactories.newDocumentBuilderFactory()` to create the `DocumentBuilderFactory` which should ensure secure XML parsing.
- The affected versions are prior to 18.1.0. Patched versions are 18.1.6 and 18.2.2.
- Workarounds involve disabling the Draw.io module or the entire REST API.
- The CVSS score is 4.6 with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.
