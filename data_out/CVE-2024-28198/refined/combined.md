# XML external entity (XXE) injection

Moderate

[gnaegi](/gnaegi)
published
GHSA-pqvm-h9mg-434c
Mar 11, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 18.1.0

## Patched versions

18.1.6, 18.2.2

## Description

### Impact

By manually manipulating http requests when using the draw.io integration it is possible to read arbitrary files as the configured system user and SSRF.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in version 18.1.6 and 18.2.2. It is advised to upgrade to the latest version of 18.1.x or 18.2.x

### Workarounds

Disabling the Draw.io module or the entire REST API will secure the system

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
