# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1877

## Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK boa updateConfigIntoFlash integer overflow vulnerability

##### July 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-45742

##### SUMMARY

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the boa updateConfigIntoFlash functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11. A specially crafted series of HTTP requests can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623

Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11

##### PRODUCT URLS

rtl819x Jungle SDK - <https://www.realtek.com/en/>
WBR-6013 - <https://www.level1.com/level1_en/wbr-6013-n300-wireless-router-54069103>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

This Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerability was found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain this vulnerability from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. The version used in the device is a Realtek’SDK that uses `boa`. One of the SDK’s API is `/boafrm/formUploadConfig`. This API uploads a configuration file to change the router’s configuration. The function responsible for this API is `boa`’s `formUploadConfig`:

```
void formUploadConfig(request *wp, char *path, char *query)
{
    [...]
    head_offset = find_head_offset((char *)wp->upload_data);
    if (head_offset == -1) {
        strcpy(tmpBuf, "Invalid file format!");
        goto back;
    }
    else{
        if(!memcmp(&wp->upload_data[head_offset], "COMPHS", 6) ||
            !memcmp(&wp->upload_data[head_offset], "COMPDS", 6) ||
            !memcmp(&wp->upload_data[head_offset], "COMPCS", 6))
        {
            updateConfigIntoFlash((unsigned char *)&wp->upload_data[head_offset], (wp->upload_len-head_offset), (int *)&type, &status);
        }
    }
    [...]
}

```

This function checks if the file contains a correct magic value, then calls the `updateConfigIntoFlash` to upload the configuration in the flash:

```
static int updateConfigIntoFlash(unsigned char *data, int total_len, int *pType, int *pStatus)
{
    [...]
    int complen = 0;
    unsigned char isValidfw = 0;
    unsigned char *expFile=NULL;
    [...]
    do {
        if (
            memcmp(&data[complen], "COMPHS", 6) &&
            memcmp(&data[complen], "COMPDS", 6) &&
            memcmp(&data[complen], "COMPCS", 6)
        ) {
            if (isValidfw == 1)
                break;
        }
        if(memcmp(&data[complen], COMP_HS_SIGNATURE, COMP_SIGNATURE_LEN)==0)
        {
            isHdware=1;
        }
        pCompHeader =(COMPRESS_MIB_HEADER_Tp)&data[complen];
[1]     compRate = WORD_SWAP(pCompHeader->compRate);
[2]     compLen_of_header = DWORD_SWAP(pCompHeader->compLen);

[3]     expFile=malloc(compLen_of_header*compRate);
        if(NULL==expFile) {
            printf("malloc for expFile error!!\n");
            return 0;
        }
[4]     expandLen = Decode(data+complen+sizeof(COMPRESS_MIB_HEADER_T), compLen_of_header, expFile);
        // [...]
    }while (complen < total_len);
}

```

At `[3]` `malloc(compLen_of_header*compRate)` is called. `compLen_of_header*compRate` is a multiplication between the compression length fetched at `[2]` and the compression rate fetched at `[1]`; both values are fetched from the uploaded configuration file. At `[4]` the uploaded configuration file is decompressed into the just-allocated data.

Because no check is performed after the fetch of the components used to calculate the allocation size for `malloc`, the call at `[3]` can lead to an integer overflow. Less space than is required is allocated, leading to a heap based buffer overflow during the decompression phase at `[4]`.
