- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs in the `updateConfigIntoFlash` function within the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK due to an unchecked multiplication of `compLen_of_header` and `compRate` when allocating memory using `malloc`. This can lead to the allocation of a smaller memory buffer than required.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow: The multiplication `compLen_of_header * compRate` is not checked for potential overflow, leading to a smaller buffer allocation.
    - Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to the insufficient buffer size, the subsequent decompression of the uploaded configuration file at `[4]` overwrites adjacent memory regions, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution is possible due to the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to overwrite critical memory regions and potentially gain control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A sequence of specially crafted HTTP requests sent to the `/boafrm/formUploadConfig` API can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to upload a malicious configuration file that contains manipulated values for `compLen_of_header` and `compRate`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, likely requiring network access. They also need knowledge of the required format for the uploaded configuration file to craft a malicious payload with controlled `compLen_of_header` and `compRate` values. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H).
