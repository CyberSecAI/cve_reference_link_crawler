- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfigured shared hosting environment allows access to other users' content. A Moodle user with restore permissions and direct access to the web server outside of the Moodle webroot could execute a local file include by crafting a malicious workshop module backup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the workshop module backup and then restore it, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary local file inclusion, which could lead to the compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user with restore permissions for workshop modules and direct access to the web server outside of the Moodle webroot. They would need to create and upload a crafted, malicious backup of a workshop module, designed to exploit the file inclusion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to restore workshop modules. They also require direct access to the web server outside of the Moodle webroot to be able to modify the backup files before restoring them into Moodle. The vulnerability is only exploitable in misconfigured shared hosting environments that allow access to other users' files.
