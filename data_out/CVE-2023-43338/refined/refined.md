- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an untrusted pointer dereference in the `mjs_execute` function within `mjs.c`. Specifically, the code retrieves a function pointer from memory using `mjs_get_ptr` and then dereferences it to execute a function call: `((void (*) (struct mjs *)) mjs_get_ptr(mjs, *func))(mjs);`. The value of `*func` is attacker controlled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Untrusted Pointer Dereference (CWE-822): The code dereferences a pointer obtained from a memory location controlled by the attacker, allowing for potential hijacking of the function call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can provide a specially crafted input, which alters the value of `*func`, to the affected program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted input to the vulnerable program that alters the value of `*func`.
