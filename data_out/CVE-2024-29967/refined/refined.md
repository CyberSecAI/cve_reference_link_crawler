- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure mount points in Docker instances within Brocade SANnav.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Docker instances have mount points that allow read and write access to sensitive files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A sudo privileged user on the host OS can gain read and write access to sensitive files within the Docker containers.
- **Attack vectors**:  A sudo privileged user on the host OS can exploit the insecure mount points.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have sudo privileged access on the host operating system where the vulnerable Brocade SANnav instance is running.
