Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Bifrost application's authentication mechanism. Specifically, the application failed to properly enforce permission checks for users belonging to the "monitor" group when HTTP Basic Authentication was used. While cookie-based authentication correctly restricted "monitor" group users to read-only access, this restriction was bypassed when using HTTP Basic Authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent Authorization Enforcement:** The core issue is the inconsistency in authorization enforcement based on the authentication method used (cookie vs. basic auth).
- **Missing Privilege Check:** The code path for HTTP Basic Authentication lacked the necessary checks to prevent write requests by users in the "monitor" group.
- **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-287 because the application fails to properly authenticate and authorize users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Write Access:** An attacker with "monitor" group credentials could bypass the read-only restriction and perform write operations, such as modifying user information (e.g., changing passwords, adding admin accounts).
- **Integrity Violation:** The unauthorized write access leads to a high risk of data integrity being compromised.
- **Availability Impact:** The possibility of modifying user configurations or other data may result in a low impact on availability, depending on what specific modifications are made.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it involves sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid "monitor" Group Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials for a user belonging to the "monitor" group.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Bifrost application's server.
- **Basic Authentication Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the bypass and exploit it using HTTP Basic Authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <=v1.8.6-release of Bifrost.
- It was fixed in version v1.8.7-release.
- The vulnerability was reported by "tarihub".
- The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID: CVE-2022-39219.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 8.5.
- The affected code is located in the `admin/controller/common.go` file in the Bifrost repository (specifically, the area where `checkWriteRequest` is not called for basic auth).
