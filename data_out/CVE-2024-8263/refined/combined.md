## Enterprise Server 3.10.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.17/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.10.17: Security fixes](#3.10.17-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.10.17: Bug fixes](#3.10.17-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the `nomad` service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* When a GitHub App installation had all repositories installed individually, it was not possible to remove the repositories from the selection.
* After an administrator enabled maintenance mode from an instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator was redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode was not enabled.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`. Outdated alerts caused by edits during custom pattern backfills have been fixed in version 3.13 and above.
### [3.10.17: Changes](#3.10.17-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.10.17: Known issues](#3.10.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via management console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
## Enterprise Server 3.10.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.16/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.16-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.16: Features](#3.10.16-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.10.16: Security fixes](#3.10.16-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.16: Bug fixes](#3.10.16-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The `github-stream-processor` service could get into a state where it would continually fail to process messages with a `TRILOGY_CLOSED_CONNECTION` error.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
### [3.10.16: Changes](#3.10.16-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.10.16: Known issues](#3.10.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
### [3.10.16: Errata](#3.10.16-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.16 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.10.15](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/release-notes#3.10.15-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.10.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.15/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.10.14**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.14-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.15: Security fixes](#3.10.15-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.15: Bug fixes](#3.10.15-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* In some cases, reading data from repositories with a large number of objects would result in timeout or error.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* Deleting a branch that was targeted by many pull requests could result in delayed job processing and increased system memory usage.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
### [3.10.15: Changes](#3.10.15-changes)

* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
### [3.10.15: Known issues](#3.10.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.12-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.12: Security fixes](#3.10.12-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL**: On instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user with administrator privileges.

  Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions are not impacted. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow unauthorized access to the instance without requiring prior authentication. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-4985](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4985) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

  For more information, see [Configuring SAML single sign-on for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise) and [Enabling encrypted assertions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/enabling-encrypted-assertions).
### [3.10.12: Known issues](#3.10.12-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.10: Bug fixes](#3.10.10-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover). [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* Setting a maintenance message failed if the message contained a multibyte character.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, metrics for custom patterns alerts incorrectly included tokens in ignored locations.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
### [3.10.10: Changes](#3.10.10-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
* Administrators can improve the performance of "Create a new repository" and "Create a new fork" pages by running this command: `ghe-config app.github.create-repo-perf true && ghe-config-apply`.
### [3.10.10: Known issues](#3.10.10-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

March 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.9-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.9: Security fixes](#3.10.9-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.9: Bug fixes](#3.10.9-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* In some cases, the `codeload` service could panic during shutdown and not terminate gracefully.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* If an administrator lost SSH access to an instance, authentication from the hypervisor console using the password for the root site administrator would fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instance's HTTP timeouts.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the pattern's alerts.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9 or 3.10 could be slow if a large number of code scanning analyses were present on the instance.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the speed of migration for code scanning analyses is increased during an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or earlier.
### [3.10.9: Changes](#3.10.9-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see [Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see [Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) and [REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/commits).
### [3.10.9: Known issues](#3.10.9-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  .
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi
  pages_untar_image_tag="$(cat "$CHROOT_PATH/data/docker-image-tags/pages_untar_image_tag")"
  id="$(docker create "pages-untar:$pages_untar_image_tag")"
  sudo docker cp "$id:/data/pages-untar" "$BASE_PATH/$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar/"
  docker rm "$id"
  ``` [Updated: 2024-03-07]

  ```
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.10.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.5/download)

January 16, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.5-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.5: Security fixes](#3.10.5-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability in the Management Console. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.15/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.5: Bug fixes](#3.10.5-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
### [3.10.5: Changes](#3.10.5-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* More detailed information is logged when a GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade failed due to missing database encryption keys.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.10.5: Known issues](#3.10.5-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).

## Enterprise Server 3.10.4

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.4](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.4/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.4-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.4: Security fixes](#3.10.4-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see [Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode).

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped personal access token. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps).
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.4: Bug fixes](#3.10.4-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-repl-status` command-line utility may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-config-apply` utility may have seen the extraneous message "Error: Server closed the connection" in the logs for the utility.
* Some OAuth applications did not have device code flow (DCF) explicitly enabled, which prevented DCF from running correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server from Visual Studio Code with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
* Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
* Some responses from the REST API included an incorrect URL in the `link` header.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* In some cases, `/stafftools/users/:login` incorrectly displayed trade screening information.
* Deprecated `resource_activity` jobs were not processed and accumulated over time in the queue, causing possible memory issues.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect and unified search enabled, users trying to view the unified search code results would get a 500 error.
* On some instances, the user interface displayed a codespace button, even though GitHub Codespaces is not supported on GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* The enterprise account pages on some installations rendered very slowly.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log.
* Running `ghe-spokesctl gov info` without any arguments caused a `panic` response.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, code scanning would report an incorrect number of files scanned on the "Tools" status page.
### [3.10.4: Changes](#3.10.4-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
### [3.10.4: Known issues](#3.10.4-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.4 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10.3 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.10.4: Deprecations](#3.10.4-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps) and the security fixes for this release.
## Enterprise Server 3.10.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.3/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.3-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.10.3: Security fixes](#3.10.3-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.10.3: Bug fixes](#3.10.3-bugs)

* Authentication of programmatic access tokens did not fully validate the status of token's users, which allowed token authentication requests to succeed even if the associated user was not allowed to make such requests. This issue is unrelated to validation of token scope.
* The `dependency-graph-api` service sometimes rapidly filled logs with a large amount of Base64-encoded response data, particularly during upgrades.
* After an administrator made changes to maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator was redirected to the Settings page, but their changes were not enabled.
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command did not display all replication statuses.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-config-apply` timed out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when managing maintenance mode using `ghe-cluster-maintenance`, an erroneous warning appeared that read "Warning: Maintenance mode set on primary, please make sure to set it on any active replica if needed".
* `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On instances using the private beta of SCIM provisioning, some users were presented with a "single sign-in" hover card.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, administrators received a `500` error after attempting to force cancel a workflow run via Staff Tools.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, repositories within organizations created using the `+` dropdown menu did not have GitHub Advanced Security features enabled automatically, even if the features should have been enabled.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.10.3: Changes](#3.10.3-changes)

* Instructions in the "Migrations" section of the Management Console clarify that only standard AWS S3 endpoints are supported when configuring AWS S3 as a blob storage provider for migrations.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
### [3.10.3: Known issues](#3.10.3-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification.

* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary.
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion.

## Enterprise Server 3.10.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.10.1/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.10.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warnings**:

* This release contains a known issue that may lead to replication issues on an instance in a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration. Upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.2 or later instead of this release. For more information, see the [Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.
* A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the [Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.
### [3.10.1: Security fixes](#3.10.1-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
### [3.10.1: Bug fixes](#3.10.1-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alerts could fail to show an error message in the UI when a failure occurred closing or reopening the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, organization access for a leaked GitHub tokens was not shown to commit authors when viewing the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, when token location(s) included a commit that introduced a large change, the page for viewing the alert would load slowly.
* When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
* On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.10.1: Changes](#3.10.1-changes)

* When GitHub Enterprise checks for a new upgrade or hotpatch package, if the check fails the failure details are output to the `ghe-update-check` log, and the Management Console UI provides a "Check Again" button to rerun the check.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
### [3.10.1: Known issues](#3.10.1-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account). [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310). [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
* On an instance with a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration, a known issue causes the `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs to fail. This means repository replicas in cache servers are not updated, and will remain out of sync if the repository is updated. Additionally, if a regular repository replica becomes out of sync, repair attempts will fail, causing the corresponding repository network to be marked as failed until a network repair is triggered.

  The network repair will eventually return the repository to a healthy state. However, this process can take several hours for very large and active repositories or networks, potentially leading to prolonged replication issues. [Updated: 2023-09-26]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext. [Updated: 2023-10-31]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

For more information, see [REST API endpoints for managing GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes) in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + To help users access resources more securely, fine-grained personal access tokens are available in public beta. For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens).

    - Users can create fine-grained personal access tokens with access to their personal repositories or, if permitted, organization-owned repositories.
    - Organization and enterprise owners can enable or disable the use of fine-grained personal access tokens in organization-owned repositories, and can use the REST API or GraphQL API to manage tokens in their organizations.
    - Users creating fine-grained tokens for an organization can add the `pre-receive hooks` permission to allow managing pre-receive hooks. For more information, see [Managing pre-receive hooks on your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks/managing-pre-receive-hooks-on-the-github-enterprise-server-appliance).
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + To find vulnerabilities in specific parts of a project, users with write access to a repository can filter code scanning alerts by language or by file path by using the search queries `language:` and `path:`. For more information, see [Assessing code scanning alerts for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/assessing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository).
  + To help repository administrators and security managers quickly enable automatic code scanning without needing to configure a workflow, default setup for code scanning supports compiled languages including Go, Java, and C. Default setup is now available for all languages supported by CodeQL, except Swift. For more information, see [CodeQL code scanning for compiled languages](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages) and [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + Repository administrators and security managers can choose which languages to include or exclude in default setup for code scanning. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + To improve analysis of C# code, the release of CodeQL included with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10
    can scan projects that include features from C# 11. For more information, see [What's new in C# 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-11) in the Microsoft documentation. Support for C# 11 is in beta and subject to change. CodeQL can scan projects built with C# 11 features, but does not analyse the code used for C# 11 features themselves.
  + To help users find vulnerabilities in projects for Swift libraries and Apple apps,
    the release of CodeQL included with GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 includes support for Swift, up to version 5.8.1, and Xcode, up to version 14.3.1. Support for Swift is in beta and subject to change. Swift analysis is not supported in default setup for code scanning, and requires the advanced setup. For more information, see [Configuring advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + To help identify steps to remediate leaked secrets, repository administrators and security managers can view metadata such as the secret owner, expiration date, and access rights for any active GitHub token leaked in a repository. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing alerts from secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning#reviewing-github-token-metadata).
  + Repository administrators, security managers, and organization and enterprise owners can view metrics for alerts generated by a specific custom pattern for secret scanning. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning).
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + Dependabot can automatically update the version of Node.js dependencies managed in the pnpm package manager. For more information, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems).
  + To avoid unnecessary compute cost, Dependabot updates are automatically paused in repositories where there has been no activity on pull requests created by Dependabot for 90 days. For more information about the criteria for Dependabot updates being paused, see [About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates) and [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates).
  + To avoid unnecessary compute cost, Dependabot stops automatically rebasing a pull request for version or security updates if the pull request has been open for 30 days.
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for any historical vulnerability recognized by the National Vulnerability Database. The "Unreviewed advisories" category has been backfilled to include vulnerabilities from previous years. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for malware advisories by using the query `type:malware`. Dependabot does not send alerts for malware advisories. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + In the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), users can search for advisories for the Hex package manager, including Elixir, Erlang, and more. Dependabot does not send alerts for Hex advisories. For more information, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database).
  + Organization owners, security managers, and users with admin access to a repository can quickly enable or disable security features for a filtered selection of repositories from the "Security coverage" view in an organization's security overview. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Enabling security features for multiple repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-overview/enabling-security-features-for-multiple-repositories).
  + Enterprise owners, organization owners, and security managers can quickly assess adoption of security features and exposure to security vulnerabilities across their enterprise. The enterprise-level "Security coverage" and "Security risk" views in security overview display data for repositories in each organization where the viewer is an organization owner or security manager. These views replace the "Overview" page in the "Code Security" tab for an enterprise. The `risk` metric for filtering the "Overview" page is no longer available. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [About security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview#about-security-overview-for-enterprises).
  + Users can find curated security advisories for the Swift ecosystem in the GitHub Advisory Database. For more information, see [About the GitHub Advisory database](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database).
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.304.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.304.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + Organization owners can increase instance security by preventing members from creating self-hosted runners at the repository level. For more information, see [Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization).
  + Users with admin access to a repository can allow external systems and third-party services to approve or reject deployments across organizations, repositories, and environments by enabling custom deployment protection rules. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#custom-deployment-protection-rules).
  + The option to execute custom scripts on a self-hosted runner is no longer is beta. For more information, see [Running scripts before or after a job](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job#about-pre--and-post-job-scripts).
  + To prevent unnecessary transfer of OIDC tokens between workflows, to fetch an OIDC token generated within a reusable workflow that is outside their enterprise or organization, users must set the `id-token` permission to `write` in the workflow or specific job where the reusable workflow is called. For more information, see [Configuring OpenID Connect in cloud providers](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers#adding-permissions-settings).
  + Repository administrators, organization owners, and users with the `manage_runners:enterprise` scope for enterprises can use the REST API to create ephemeral, just-in-time (JIT) runners that can perform at most one job before being automatically removed from the repository, organization, or enterprise. For more information, see [Security hardening for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners).
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + To improve the accuracy of marked answers in discussions, and reduce the burden on users to duplicate their text to get their answer marked as correct, users can mark threaded replies as the answer to a question.
  + To improve content organization and topic discoverability, GitHub Discussions maintainers can group discussion categories into sections.
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + To prevent unnecessary repository removal, the API for managing the repositories accessible by a GitHub App in your organization has been updated to fail early if the application is currently granted access to `all` repositories in the organization. This API can only be used to remove a repository when the application has been granted access to an explicit list of repositories. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for GitHub App installations](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/apps/installations#remove-a-repository-from-an-app-installation).
  + Repository administrators can ensure the security and stability of branches by requiring pull request approval by someone other than the last pusher. For more information, see [About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Projects is no longer in public beta, and is now considered generally available. For more information, see [About Projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).
  + To control the amount of work in progress and promote focus, on a board layout, users with admin access to a project can set a recommended limit on the number of items in a column. For more information, see [Customizing the board layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout#setting-a-limit-on-the-number-of-items-in-a-column).
  + To determine the default access rights organization members have to projects where they haven't been granted individual access, organization owners can set a base role for projects. For more information, see [Managing access to your projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects#managing-access-for-organization-level-projects).
  + To share a pre-configured project with other people in an organization, users with admin access to a project can set the project as a template. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing project templates in your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization).
  + In a table layout, users can select and update multiple cells at once by clicking and dragging or using the `Shift` or `Ctrl`/`Command` key.
* #### [Commits](#commits)

  + When editing a file in the user interface, users with permission to bypass branch protection rules receive a note if their commit will bypass a rule, with the option to create a new branch instead of committing directly to the protected branch. Previously, the commit was added to the protected branch directly, without indication that a rule was being bypassed.
  + When using `git push` from the command line, users with permission to bypass branch protection rules receive a note if they have pushed a commit that bypasses a rule. Previously there was no indication after a Git push that branch rules had been bypassed.
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Users can include mathematical expressions within Markdown by using LaTeX syntax delimited by `$` characters and backticks. For more information, see [Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions#writing-inline-expressions).
* #### [Accessibility](#accessibility)

  + To make GitHub inclusive to all developers, GitHub has improved color contrast of the default light and dark themes, making them accessible to all users. These changes were made to Primer, [GitHub's Design System](https://primer.style/). For more information, see [GitHub Accessibility](https://accessibility.github.com/).
### [3.10.0: Changes](#3.10.0-changes)

* Field names and destinations for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed in this release and the prior release. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  For a full list of field mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv) and the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv). This change is part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and additional field names will change in upcoming releases.
* Users who use pull requests with protected branches may be affected by the following security measures.

  + Merge commits created locally and pushed to a protected branch are rejected if the contents of the commit differ from the merge commit predicted by GitHub.
  + If the branch protection rule for dismissing stale reviews is active, an approving review is dismissed if the merge base changes after the review was submitted. The merge base is the commit that is the latest common ancestor of the pull request branch and the protected branch.
  + A pull request approval only counts towards the pull request it was submitted for. Previously, approvals were gathered across multiple independent pull requests if the pull request branches pointed to the same commit and targeted the same base branch.
* The `PUT` and `DELETE` operations on the `/installations/{installation_id}/repositories/{repository_id}` endpoint are no longer functional for the management of GitHub App installations. You can add or remove a repository from an app installation using the documented APIs instead. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for GitHub App installations](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/rest/apps/installations).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to make it easier to assess vulnerabilities to exposed secrets, enterprise owners and organization owners receive a single email with the results of the historical scan for secrets that is performed when secret scanning is first enabled in an organization or enterprise. Previously, secret scanning sent an email for each repository where secrets were detected. For more information, see [About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in the "Files changed" view of pull requests, GitHub only displays code scanning alerts for vulnerabilities detected in lines that a pull request has changed. Previously, code scanning displayed all alerts unique to the pull request branch, even if they were unrelated to the changes the pull request introduced.
### [3.10.0: Backups](#3.10.0-backups)

* To generate backups of an instance more quickly, in GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later, the job for pruning snapshots is no longer performed as part of the `ghe-backup` tool. Site administrators can prune snapshots manually or on a schedule by running the `ghe-prune-snapshots` job. For more information, see [Scheduling backups](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/blob/master/docs/scheduling-backups.md) in the `github/backup-utils` repository.
* To reduce the data transfer required to regularly back up an instance, GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later allows administrators to perform incremental backups of a MySQL 8 database. For more information, see [Making a Differential or Incremental Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/mysqlbackup.incremental.html) in the MySQL documentation.
### [3.10.0: Known issues](#3.10.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance).
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see [Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310). [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-09-04]
* After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser. [Updated: 2023-09-19]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes. [Updated: 2023-09-21]
* On an instance with a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration, a known issue causes the `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs to fail. This means repository replicas in cache servers are not updated, and will remain out of sync if the repository is updated. Additionally, if a regular repository replica becomes out of sync, repair attempts will fail, causing the corresponding repository network to be marked as failed until a network repair is triggered.

  The network repair will eventually return the repository to a healthy state. However, this process can take several hours for very large and active repositories or networks, potentially leading to prolonged replication issues. [Updated: 2023-09-26]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext. [Updated: 2023-10-31]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

## Enterprise Server 3.11.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.19/download)

December 17, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.19: Security fixes](#3.11.19-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.19: Bug fixes](#3.11.19-bugs)

* The audit log cluster rebalance script incorrectly proceeded before all shards were ready. This caused the script to exit before the necessary data was available, potentially leading to issues with the audit log migration.
* For instances hosted on Azure, if a pre-upgrade check failed due to insufficient user disk size, the Management Console displayed an internal server error.
* Pull request synchronization—the process keeping pull requests up to date with the latest commits to a branch—sometimes failed to retry if the initial synchronization process failed.
* When creating a pre-receive hook environment, attempts to include an image URL over 255 characters failed with a database error. The maximum length is still 255 characters, but the URL length is now validated before the process starts.
* Performing a browser back navigation to a pull request now displays up-to-date status checks.
* Subversion services were non-functional in some cases.
### [3.11.19: Changes](#3.11.19-changes)

* Pull request merges are handled more efficiently, allowing more Git objects to be created before timeout. Additionally, loose objects created by merges that time out are now discarded, limiting the accumulation of these objects.
### [3.11.19: Known issues](#3.11.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.

## Enterprise Server 3.11.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.17/download)

November 07, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.17: Security fixes](#3.11.17-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This is a follow up fix for [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487) to further harden the encrypted assertions feature against this type of attack. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document to exploit this vulnerability.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with Enterprise Administrator access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance could escalate privileges to SSH root access. This is achieved by exploiting the pre-receive hook environment to bypass symlink checks in the `ghe-firejail` path and execute malicious scripts. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10007](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-10007) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.11.17: Bug fixes](#3.11.17-bugs)

* This error message `mbind: Operation not permitted` was repeatedly showing in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` MySQL logs.
* When saving settings in the Management Console, the configuration run would stop if the `enterprise-manage` process was restarted.
* A missing configuration value prevented Dependabot from creating group update pull requests.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* The initial setup certificate generation in AWS took longer than expected due to fallback to private IPs. The time for this fallback has been reduced.
* If the primary instance was unreachable, running `ghe-repl-stop --force` on a replica would fail during the config apply run.
* When restoring from a backup, repositories that had been deleted in the last 90 days were not completely restored.
* Restoring Git repositories using `backup-utils` occasionally failed.
* Some customers upgrading from 3.11 to 3.13 may experience issues with undecryptable records during the upgrade. This issue has now been resolved. We recommend you read [Undecryptable records](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/upgrading-your-instance/troubleshooting-upgrades/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#undecryptable-records).
### [3.11.17: Changes](#3.11.17-changes)

* For instances deployed on AWS, the default settings for Chrony NTP synchronization have been aligned with AWS's suggested default configurations.
### [3.11.17: Known issues](#3.11.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.16: Security fixes](#3.11.16-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
### [3.11.16: Bug fixes](#3.11.16-bugs)

* HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
* An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
* The "List teams" API endpoint returned duplicate results when paginating.
* A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
* Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
### [3.11.16: Changes](#3.11.16-changes)

* Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
* The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
### [3.11.16: Known issues](#3.11.16-known-issues)

## Enterprise Server 3.11.15

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.15](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.15/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.15: Security fixes](#3.11.15-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.11.15: Bug fixes](#3.11.15-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
* After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* Placing Nomad jobs would not allow retries in cases when Nomad wasn't available yet.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* When a GitHub App installation had all repositories installed individually, it was not possible to remove the repositories from the selection.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`. Outdated alerts caused by edits during custom pattern backfills have been fixed in version 3.13 and above.
### [3.11.15: Changes](#3.11.15-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.11.15: Known issues](#3.11.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS.

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
## Enterprise Server 3.11.14

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.14](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.14/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.11.14: Features](#3.11.14-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.11.14: Security fixes](#3.11.14-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could update the `title`, `assignees`, and `labels` of any issue inside a public repository. This was only exploitable inside a public repository, and private/internal repositories were not affected. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-7711](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-7711) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.14: Bug fixes](#3.11.14-bugs)

* During hotpatching and sometimes when applying configuration changes, a configuration run to upgrade the GitHub Actions service was unnecessarily triggered. The GitHub Actions service will only be upgraded in GitHub Enterprise Server feature releases.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Restarting the `resolvconf` service would not correctly update the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* The `ghe-migrations` utility for visualizing migrations did not work due to a regression. Administrators can now run `ghe-migrations` to view the progress and status of `github` migrations, or run `ghe-migrations --all` to view progress on all services.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Site administrators could not switch maintenance mode directly from "scheduled" to "on," or vice versa.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The `github-stream-processor` service could get into a state where it would continually fail to process messages with a `TRILOGY_CLOSED_CONNECTION` error.
* The wrong help link was displayed when push protection blocked a secret from the CLI.
* For repositories with issues disabled, issue links were redirected to pull requests.
* In custom pre-receive hooks, the paths stored in environment variables that allow for newly pushed objects to be in a quarantine directory could be incorrectly interpreted as relative to a worktree instead of the Git directory, causing certain commands to fail to read from the repository. The variables now use absolute paths.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
### [3.11.14: Changes](#3.11.14-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* Users can set their styling preference for link underlines in the web interface, on their "Accessibility" settings page.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.11.14: Known issues](#3.11.14-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* On boot, the `resolvconf` service may fail to start because the `/run/resolvconf` directory does not exist when the service attempts to `touch` a file there, with the error:

  ```
  /bin/touch: cannot touch '/run/resolvconf/postponed-update': No such file or directory

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue with the following commands — this change will persist on reboots, but not upgrades:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak \
  '/\[Service\]/a ExecStartPre\=\/bin\/mkdir \-p \/run\/resolvconf' \
  /etc/systemd/system/resolvconf.service.d/local.conf

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start resolvconf

  ```

  [Updated: 2024-08-26]
### [3.11.14: Errata](#3.11.14-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.14 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.11.13](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes#3.11.13-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.11.13

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.13/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.11.12**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

### [3.11.13: Security fixes](#3.11.13-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.13: Bug fixes](#3.11.13-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The threshold set by `server_rejoin_age_max` for single-node GHES deployments was too low.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In a high availablity configuration, running `ghe-repl-node` multiple times from a node that did not have replication running had the potential to overwrite the configuration on the primary node.
* Configuration history is only generated for instances in a cluster, high availability (HA) cluster, or standalone HA configuration. The current node must be a primary or replica node with replication running.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On certain branch names, the branch info bar was causing frozen string errors.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* On instances with SCIM enabled, the administrator was unable to view users without an external identity record (for example, because they were provisioned before SCIM was enabled on the instance) in stafftools.
* On instances enrolled in the SCIM private beta, built-in authentication users can be added to organizations and teams. Organization owners will no longer see the misleading message that the organization membership is managed by the SAML identity provider when updating organization memberships.
* Enterprise owners managed by an identity provider were asked to authenticate within GitHub when performing privileged actions.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* The `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` could not initialize in some cases, resulting in an exception when handling the error.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* When including a `.gitignore` or `README.md` file on repository creation failed due to a ruleset or pre-receive hook, no error message displayed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, requests to the `/enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/advanced-security` REST API endpoint could fail due to timeout.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, commits made by users who do not belong to an organization were not counted.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a Git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, contributions were not tracked on public repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the "adjust configuration" step failed when enabling code scanning with the default setup on self-hosted Windows runners.
* Migration of the `issue_edits` table caused intermittent failures during the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11, resulting in the error message `ActiveRecord::ConcurrentMigrationError: Failed to release advisory lock.` [Updated: 2024-08-14]
### [3.11.13: Changes](#3.11.13-changes)

* In a high availability configuration, users can only run `ghe-config-apply` or `ghe-cluster-config-apply` on a replica node if replication is already running (from `ghe-repl-start`). If replication isnt running on the node, the user will be instructed to start replication.
* Configuration history has been extended. When `ghe-config-apply`, `ghe-cluster-config-apply`, or `ghe-config-archive` is run: `secrets.conf` is captured, a sha256sum for each of the current configuration files is included, the existing patch that is generated includes `secrets.conf`, and an additional sanitized patch that excludes `secrets.conf` is also generated.
* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* A more specific error message is shown when a non-provisioned user tried to sign in to an instance with SCIM enabled.
* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
* A more specific error message is shown when a deprovisioned user attempts signing into an instance with SCIM enabled.
* In the audit logs, administrators can see more context for failed user authentication attempts using LDAP.
* The system logs provide more context for authentication failures related to multi-factor authentication.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
* To avoid excessive log volume and associated disk pressure, requests for `GetCacheKey` are no longer logged. Previously, the high frequency of these requests caused significant log accumulation.
### [3.11.13: Known issues](#3.11.13-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* *Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.*
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

### [3.11.11: Security fixes](#3.11.11-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the site administrator role could gain arbitrary code execution capability on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when configuring audit log streaming. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5746) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.11: Bug fixes](#3.11.11-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions and External MySQL enabled, a validation step in the config apply could fail.
* Users would see an error message from the server while pushing to a gist (the push would still complete).
### [3.11.11: Known issues](#3.11.11-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* `ghe-migrations` visualizer is not working due to a known regression. As a results, users will not be able to use `ghe-migrations` to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead you can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to get the status/progress of migrations.
* When enabling [log forwarding](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity-in-your-enterprise/log-forwarding#enabling-log-forwarding), specific services logs (babeld and some more) are duplicated.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via management console without subdomain isolation.
* When log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

### [3.11.9: Security fixes](#3.11.9-security-fixes)

* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated in the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.9: Bug fixes](#3.11.9-bugs)

* Running `ghe-repl-node -d` did not validate value length in order to prevent values longer than 20 characters.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-repl-setup` did not successfully complete on a replica due to a missing key.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration, during the migration phase of a configuration run, the process of copying configuration updates to all nodes would fail.
* An LDAP-related error message was incorrectly displayed at the enterprise and organization levels.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, a misconfiguration caused jobs to be added to the `hydro_update_rule_override_for_repository_visibility_change_event` queue but not processed.
* An incorrect job queue mapping caused the `hydro_advanced_security_archived_status_changed` queue to constantly grow.
* External collaborators with read-only access were able to run workflows on their pull requests from private forks without approval.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering.
### [3.11.9: Changes](#3.11.9-changes)

* To aid in understanding the CPU/memory utilization of secret scanning processes, the binary names of nomad workers were updated to differentiate between the different types of secret scanning jobs.
* A more specific error message is shown when the `ghe-repl-node` command is run on an instance not configured for high availability.
* The SCIM private beta has resumed with support from GitHub engineering in GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11 and later. Site administrators can provision users and groups on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance automatically with SCIM. SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server is in private beta and subject to change.

### [3.11.8: Security fixes](#3.11.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the editor role in the Management Console could gain administrative SSH access to the appliance by command injection when configuring the chat integration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-3646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). The editor role has been deprecated. For more information, see the "Changes" section of these release notes.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring Artifact & Logs and Migrations Storage. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3684](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3684) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with a deploy key for an organization-owned repository could bypass a ruleset that specified organization administrators as bypass actors. Exploitation would require an attacker to already have access to a valid deploy key for a repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3470](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3470) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a detached repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions while the repository is detached. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2440) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* A GraphQL endpoint was disabled as part of a previous security fix, causing projects auto-add workflow and inline issue creation errors. To resolve these errors, a security patch was applied that allows for the affected GraphQL endpoint to be re-enabled.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.8: Bug fixes](#3.11.8-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability replication enabled, Git operations for existing repositories would fail after failover to the replica cluster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover). [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* A Redis job had a memory limit that was too low in some cases, leading the process to run out of memory.
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* Some search indices in Stafftools failed to load.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* Unauthenticated requests to the REST APIs `/search/code` endpoint returned erroneous rate-limit values.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* On some pages that listed users on an instance, the web UI erroneously rendered checkboxes to the right of users details.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* Setting a maintenance message failed if the message contained a multibyte character.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
* On an instance with repository caching configured, adding new repositories to a cache node sometimes failed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, after enabling secret scanning for the first time for an organization or the instance, the historical backfills for alerts in existing repositories issues did not appear.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, metrics for custom patterns alerts incorrectly included tokens in ignored locations.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
### [3.11.8: Changes](#3.11.8-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
### [3.11.8: Known issues](#3.11.8-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

### [3.11.7: Security fixes](#3.11.7-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.7: Bug fixes](#3.11.7-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* On an instance in a high availability or cluster configuration, configuring `fluent-bit` on a primary node returned an empty `primary_host` value.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instances HTTP timeouts.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* If an administrator lost SSH access to an instance, authentication from the hypervisor console using the password for the root site administrator would fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the security overview did not display updated alert counts for code scanning immediately after the completion of analysis.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the speed of migration for code scanning analyses is increased during an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or earlier.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, weekly scheduled runs for code scanning's default setup might not occur.
### [3.11.7: Changes](#3.11.7-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the patterns alerts.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see [Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see [Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) and [REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/commits).
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
### [3.11.7: Known issues](#3.11.7-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.15/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.3: Bug fixes](#3.11.3-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
* Hotpatch upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` resulted in the instance losing network connectivity after a reboot.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
* Under rare circumstances, a repository could become unavailable due to a temporary file being left behind after a Git process was unexpectedly interrupted (for example, due to a power outage).
* On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security enabled, a suspended user would consume a license for GitHub Advanced Security.
### [3.11.3: Changes](#3.11.3-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.11.3: Known issues](#3.11.3-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

## Enterprise Server 3.11.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.11.1/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.11.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: Hotpatch upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` will result in the instance losing network connectivity after a reboot. We have removed the hotpatch upgrade package for the `3.11.1` version of GitHub Enterprise Server to ensure this upgrade path is not executed accidentally. Before you upgrade, please make sure you have read the [Known issues](#3.11.1-known-issues) section of these release notes.

### [3.11.1: Security fixes](#3.11.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see [Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode).

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped personal access token. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps).
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.11.1: Bug fixes](#3.11.1-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* Error messages were not shown when `ghe-config-apply` encountered specific kinds of errors.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* In some cases, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11 could fail due to the Consul server failing to start.
* Endpoints for the REST API's Manage GitHub Enterprise Server operation returned `internal service error` if `cluster.conf` was not found on the instance.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
### [3.11.1: Changes](#3.11.1-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
### [3.11.1: Known issues](#3.11.1-known-issues)

* [Hotpatch upgrades](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/upgrading-your-instance/performing-an-upgrade/upgrading-with-a-hotpatch) from GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.11.0` to `3.11.1` will result in the appliance losing network connectivity after a reboot.
  If you have upgraded to GitHub Enterprise Server `3.11.1` from `3.11.0` using a hotpatch upgrade, please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/) for assistance.
  If you have upgraded directly to GitHub Enterprise Server `3.11.1` from previous versions (for example, from any version of GitHub Enterprise Server in the 3.9 or 3.10 series), your instance is not affected by this issue. [Updated 2023-12-27]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.1 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11.0. [Updated 2024-01-03]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.11.1: Deprecations](#3.11.1-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see [Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps) and the security fixes for this release.

    - [Permissions required for GitHub Apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps)
* #### [Audit logs](#audit-logs)

  + The web interface for enterprise, organization, and user audit logs include an expandable view that displays the full audit log payload for each event. Administrators and users can see the same event metadata when searching the audit log in the web interface or via streaming. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [About the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/about-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)

* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, in repositories that use default setup for code scanning, the default setup configuration updates automatically if GitHub detects new languages. Users can view a repository's language configuration for default setup from the repository's "Code security and analysis" settings page. Additionally, users can view information about setup and debug failed languages from the tools status page. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale#about-adding-languages-to-an-existing-default-setup-configuration)
    - [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning)
    - [About the tool status page for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page)
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, default setup for code scanning at the organization level is now generally available. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale) and [REST API endpoints for organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization) in the REST API documentation.
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during configuration of default setup for code scanning, users can select either the "Extended" or "Default" query suite for eligible repositories in an organization. For more information, see [CodeQL query suites](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/built-in-codeql-query-suites) and [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, to better protect active and inactive repositories, GitHub Enterprise Server automatically analyzes repositories that use a default setup for code scanning. The analysis runs on a weekly schedule and uses the most recent version of CodeQL. When configuring code scanning, the fixed time for the weekly scan is randomly chosen. The scan will take place at the same time every week, and the schedule is displayed after the setup is completed, so users can easily see when the next scheduled analysis will occur. The scheduled analysis will be automatically disabled if a repository has no activity for six months. Creation of a pull request or pushes to the repository will re-enable scheduled analysis.
  + Code scanning default setup is available for Swift analysis with CodeQL. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically).
  + CodeQL 2.14.6 and later supports analysis of code written in Go 1.21. For more information, see [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + With CodeQL model packs for Java, users can improve code scanning results by ensuring that any custom Java libraries and frameworks used by their codebase are recognized by CodeQL. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - [Editing your configuration of default setup](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup)

    - [Using the CodeQL model editor](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/using-the-codeql-model-editor) in the CodeQL documentation
  + For instances with GitHub Connect configured, code scanning with CodeQL supports Java codebases that use [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/). Previously, code scanning users were able to scan Java applications that contained Lombok code, but all the contents of files containing Lombok code were either skipped or users had to apply a workaround to prepare the applications for scanning. Lombok features will now be automatically scanned without requiring any workaround.

    For more information about syncing the required GitHub Actions workflow to scan Lombok code, see [Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions).
  + Push protection for secret scanning is now generally available. For more information, see [About push protection](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning).
  + To prevent the leak of tokens where users work outside of code, secret scanning detects tokens in both new and historical issue titles, descriptions, and comments. When a new token type is added to secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server scans for matches automatically. This expanded coverage also detects and surfaces secrets that match any custom pattern defined at the repository, organization, or enterprise level. These secrets appear both in the web interface and in queries to the REST API. For more information, see [About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) and [Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning).
  + Users can view metrics associated with push protection usage across an organization. The overview shows a summary of blocks and bypasses, as well as more granular metrics. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk).
  + A new REST API endpoint is available for dataflow analysis using custom CodeQL queries. The new endpoint offers additional flexibility, includes improvements that prevent common pitfalls with the old API, and improves the performance of query evaluation by five percent. For more information, see [New dataflow API for writing custom CodeQL queries](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-14-new-dataflow-api-for-writing-custom-codeql-queries/) in the GitHub Changelog.
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + For developers who manage Node.js dependencies using the pnpm package manager, pnpm is fully supported by dependency graph, Dependabot alerts, and Dependabot security updates. For more information about securing your supply chain with Dependabot, see [Keeping your supply chain secure with Dependabot](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot).
  + Developers can enforce policies related to vulnerabilities and licenses in pull requests for complex ecosystems with transitive dependencies like Gradle and Scala. Dependency review supports dependencies from the dependency submission API. For more information, see the following articles.

    - [About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#best-practices-for-using-the-dependency-review-api-and-the-dependency-submission-api-together)
    - [About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)
    - [Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)
  + To control how Dependabot structures pull requests and improve mergeability, users can implement flexible grouping options in `dependabot.yml`. You can also control Dependabot's behavior for groups using comment commands. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#groups) and [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).
  + Dependabot can open pull requests for Swift and Gradle dependencies.

    - Users can also configure scheduled updates for Swift dependencies using `dependabot.yml`.
    - If users have used the REST API for dependency submission to upload Gradle dependencies to the dependency graph and receive Dependabot alerts for those dependencies, Dependabot will try to open a pull request to resolve security updates enabled for the repository.

    For more information, see [Configuring Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates).
  + Responses from REST API endpoints for repositories display whether Dependabot security updates are enabled or disabled. Users can also enable or disable security updates for a repository using the REST API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/repos/repos) in the REST API documentation.
  + When Dependabot is first enabled, GitHub will not send notifications for all vulnerable dependencies found in the repository, only for new vulnerable dependencies ifentified after Dependabot is enabled. For more information, see [Configuring notifications for Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts).
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + To assess risks to code security and ensure adoption of features to improve code security, the "Security risk" and "Security coverage" pages for organizations and the entire instance are generally available. Additionally, the alert-centric pages for Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning are also now generally available. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk) and [Assessing adoption of code security features](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security).
  + Users can take advantage of the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) using the REST API. The Advisory Database is a free, open-source list of actionable security advisories and CVEs. API responses include machine-readable mappings to the ecosystem, package name, and affected versions of impacted software. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for global security advisories](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories) in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.309.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.309.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + To better navigate, trace, understand, and monitor deployments, users can view and track the full history of deployments in a repository or filter across environments. For more information, see [Viewing deployment history](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/managing-your-deployments/viewing-deployment-history).
  + Users can improve the security of deployment environments by configuring a branch protection policy to only allow specific branches to deploy to an environment. Additionally, the following security improvements apply to environments.

    - GitHub Enterprise Server blocks runs triggered from forks with branch names that match the protected branch's name.
    - Tags with the same name as a protected branch cannot deploy to the environments with a branch protection configuration.

    For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches).
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a configuration for deployment environments, administrators for environments can improve the security of deployments by enforcing a review by someone other than the person who triggered the run. This option prevents required reviewers from self-reviewing to trigger workflows. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#required-reviewers).
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + Organization owners can signal that an organization is no longer actively maintained by archiving the organization. For more information, see [Archiving an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/organizations/managing-organization-settings/archiving-an-organization).
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Users can govern protections for branches and tags in a repository using repository rules. To govern the protections for all of an organization's repositories, users can also enable rulesets for an organization. Contributors to a repository can see which rules apply via the web interface, Git, or the GitHub CLI. For more information, see [About rulesets](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).
  + Users can create new repositories with predefined attributes using query parameters. For example, a user can create a URL that prepopulates information about the repository like the name, description, visibility, and more. For more information, see [Creating a new repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository#creating-a-new-repository-from-a-url-query).
  + Users can more easily understand changes to a repository using the activity view. For more information, see [Using the activity view to see changes to a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/using-the-activity-view-to-see-changes-to-a-repository).
* #### [Issues](#issues)

  + Users can automatically add a new issue to projects using a custom issue form by defining `projects` in the issue template. For more information, see [Syntax for issue forms](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Users can review items in a project view broken down by a certain field value. For more information, see [Customizing the table layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout#slicing-by-field-values).
  + Users can create charts to visualize current project items, or visualize project items over time. For more information, see [About insights for Projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/viewing-insights-from-your-project/about-insights-for-projects).
* #### [Accessibility](#accessibility)

  + To improve the visibility of links with blocks of text in the web interface for GitHub Enterprise Server, users can apply underline styling. For more information, see [Managing accessibility settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/managing-accessibility-settings#managing-the-appearance-of-links).
### [3.11.0: Changes](#3.11.0-changes)

* The speed of restoration operations with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities has increased.
* Configuration runs now correspond with a unique ID. During the run, the log remains at `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`. After the run, the instance rotates the log's contents into `/data/user/config-apply/logs/YYYYMMDD/ghe-config.HOSTNAME.ID.log`, where YYYYMMDD is the date of the run, HOSTNAME is the hostname of the node, and ID is the ID of the run. For more information, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#log-files-for-instance-configuration).
* Field names for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed as part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Additional field names were changed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and 3.10. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  For a full list of mappings, download the OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server [3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), [3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), and [3.11](/assets/ghes-3.11-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv).
* On an instance that uses built-in authentication or LDAP, if two-factor authentication (2FA) is configured for an organization, a user could use a TOTP code multiple times within the code's window of validity during authentication or when entering sudo mode for sensitive actions. To improve security, this reuse is no longer allowed. External systems with a scripted login flow across multiple parallel jobs may stop working as a result of this change.

  For more information about 2FA, see the following articles.

  + [Requiring two-factor authentication for an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/requiring-two-factor-authentication-for-an-organization)
  + [Sudo mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/sudo-mode)
  + [Configuring two-factor authentication](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app)
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, during analysis of Python projects with code scanning using CodeQL and an advanced setup, GitHub Enterprise Server would automatically install dependencies for the project. Due to improvements to CodeQL, GitHub Enterprise Server no longer needs to fetch these dependencies to analyze a codebase. To improve scan times for Python projects, automatic dependency installation is disabled.

  If you configured code scanning with CodeQL via advanced setup to disable dependency installation, GitHub recommends setting `setup-python-dependencies` to `false` for the configuration. For more information, see [Customizing your advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#analyzing-python-dependencies).
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, due to misconfiguration or incompatible versions, Dependabot jobs for a repository can fail. After 30 failed runs, subsequent scheduled jobs will fail immediately until you trigger a check for updates from the dependency graph, or until you update a manifest file. Jobs for Dependabot security updates will still trigger normally.
* On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security, to help users more efficiently review and filter code scanning alerts at scale using the REST API, the `updated_at` field in API responses is improved. The `updated_at` timestamp now represents an alert's most recent state change on the branch that you requested. State changes include an alert being introduced, fixed, dismissed, reopened, or reintroduced. Previously, the `updated_at` timestamp changed frequently, whenever an alert was found in an analysis or the alert state changed. For more information about using the REST API to retrieve code scanning alerts, see [REST API endpoints for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28) in the REST API documentation.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, the following improvements apply to the repository view for dependency graph, available from the repository's "Insights" tab.

  + Users can search by package name from a paginated list of all dependencies.
  + Dependency licenses are displayed.
  + Dependabot alerts appear for dependencies, sorted by severity, and link to the Dependabot alerts and the Dependabot update pull request where applicable.

  For more information about the dependency graph, see [About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).
* After first enabling Dependabot on an instance, GitHub Enterprise Server will no longer send web or email notifications for repositories that are initially populated with Dependabot alerts. This allows you to review the new Dependabot alerts for a repository, organization, or the entire instance without immediately notifying other users of existing alerts.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, workflows that use Node.js 16 or earlier will log a warning. Node.js 16 has been end-of-life since [September 2023](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/#end-of-life-releases).

  + Workflow authors should update actions to run on Node.js 20. For more information, see [Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions).
  + Users with workflows that use Node.js should specify Node.js 20 or later in the workflows using versioned actions. For more information, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-versioned-actions).

  [Updated: 2024-03-05]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and runners using GitHub Actions Runner 2.309.0 or later, users can no longer use `GITHUB_ENV` to set the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable in workflows. Workflows that set `NODE_OPTIONS` as an environment variable will now log the following error. For more information, see [Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable) and the [v2.309.0 release](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.309.0) in the actions/runner repository on GitHub.com.

  ```
  Can't store NODE_OPTIONS output parameter using '$GITHUB_ENV' command.

  ```
* Users can quickly take action on multiple items in a group, or the group itself, using the `•••` button in a table, board, or roadmap.
* Users can break out items in a project by workstreams, team members, priorities, or other groupings using a swimlane view. For more information, see [Customizing the board layout](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout#grouping-by-field-values).
* Users can view view the template used to create a project from a project's settings.
* When scrolling through a project, group headers are now sticky.
* The colors for single-select fields in a project have been updated, so users see the same colors within the field picker and within project views.
* Users create can create issues in a project view that's grouped by repository in the board layout by clicking "Create new issue", or by starting to type the issue's title.
### [3.11.0: Known issues](#3.11.0-known-issues)

* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.0 may fail, hanging on the "Reloading system services" screen. The following error will appear in `/var/log/syslog`.

  ```
  agent: Error starting agent: error="Failed to start Consul server: Failed to start Raft: failed to load any existing snapshots"

  ```

  This issue is resolved in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11.1. When upgrading to a release in the 3.11 series, upgrade to 3.11.1 or later. [Updated 2023-12-21]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see [Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations.

### [3.11.0: Deprecations](#3.11.0-deprecations)

* #### [Enterprise-level security overview is deprecated](#enterprise-level-security-overview-is-deprecated)

  + The enterprise-level "Security overview" page is deprecated in favor of the new "Security risk" and "Security coverage" pages. For more information, see [Assessing your code security risk](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk) and [Assessing adoption of code security features](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security).
* #### [Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7](#dependabot-updates-no-longer-support-python-36-or-37)

  + Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7, which have reached end-of-life. If a user's code uses these versions, Dependabot will no longer be able to open pull requests in your repository and will log errors. Update to Python 3.8 or later to ensure your code is secure and Dependabot can still run.

    Users will continue to receive Dependabot alerts for dependencies with known vulnerabilities. To resolve these alerts, users can manually upgrade the affected package.

    For more information about Python releases, see [Status of Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions) on the Python website. For more information about supported package managers for Dependabot, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems).
* #### [Upcoming deprecation of team discussions](#upcoming-deprecation-of-team-discussions)

  + GitHub will deprecate team discussions for users in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13. In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11, a banner appears atop teams' discussions with information about the deprecation, including a link to tooling to migrate existing team discussions to GitHub Discussions. For more information, see [About team discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions) and [About discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions). [Updated: 2024-03-04]
* #### [Elasticsearch index `repository-stack` is no longer in use](#elasticsearch-index-repository-stack-is-no-longer-in-use)

  + The Elasticsearch index `repository-stacks` is no longer in use. [Updated: 2024-06-24]
### [3.11.0: Errata](#3.11.0-errata)

* The [Changes](/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes#3.11.0-changes) section previously indicated that users should update GitHub Actions workflows and actions to run on Node.js 16. Node.js 16 has reached end of life, and users should instead update actions and workflows to run on Node.js 20 or later. [Updated: 2024-03-05]

## Enterprise Server 3.12.13

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.13/download)

December 17, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.13: Security fixes](#3.12.13-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.13: Bug fixes](#3.12.13-bugs)

* The `--no-async` flag was not implemented for the `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, leading to a potentially increased load.
* In a high availability configuration, with GitHub Actions, replication would fail on nodes where MSSQL was not configured to run.
* The audit log cluster rebalance script incorrectly proceeded before all shards were ready. This caused the script to exit before the necessary data was available, potentially leading to issues with the audit log migration.
* For instances hosted on Azure, if a pre-upgrade check failed due to insufficient user disk size, the Management Console displayed an internal server error.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, when selecting repositories for a dry run of an enterprise-level custom pattern, searches for full repository names (`ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY`) did not return results.
* When creating a pre-receive hook environment, attempts to include an image URL over 255 characters failed with a database error. The maximum length is still 255 characters, but the URL length is now validated before the process starts.
* Performing a browser back navigation to a pull request now displays up-to-date status checks.
* Subversion services were non-functional in some cases.
### [3.12.13: Changes](#3.12.13-changes)

* When exporting repositories to blob storage using the migrations REST API endpoint to start an organization migration, the maximum compressed archive size is limited to 90 GB. This is an increase from 30 GB.
* Pull request merges are handled more efficiently, allowing more Git objects to be created before timeout. Additionally, loose objects created by merges that time out are now discarded, limiting the accumulation of these objects.
* When exporting repositories using the migrations REST API, prior to blob storage upload the tarball is staged in the root volume. For more disk capacity, the tarball will now be staged in the data volume.
### [3.12.13: Known issues](#3.12.13-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**. When regenerating the certificates with management console, the `subdomain reply.[hostname]` is missing from the ssl certification.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Some customers upgrading from 3.11.x or 3.12.x may experience a bug with the feature "Automatic update checks", filling the root disk with logs causing a system degradation. To prevent this, you can turn off the feature [Enable automatic update check](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/enabling-automatic-update-checks#enabling-automatic-update-checks) in the management console.

* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* Attempting to stop replications after stopping GitHub Actions on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance would fail, reporting that MSSQL was not responding.

To prevent this, you can turn off the feature [Enable automatic update check](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/enabling-automatic-update-checks#enabling-automatic-update-checks) in the management console.
## Enterprise Server 3.12.11

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.11](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.11/download)

November 07, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.11: Security fixes](#3.12.11-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This is a follow up fix for [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487) to further harden the encrypted assertions feature against this type of attack. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document to exploit this vulnerability.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with Enterprise Administrator access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance could escalate privileges to SSH root access. This is achieved by exploiting the pre-receive hook environment to bypass symlink checks in the `ghe-firejail` path and execute malicious scripts. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10007](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-10007) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.12.11: Bug fixes](#3.12.11-bugs)

* This error message `mbind: Operation not permitted` was repeatedly showing in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` MySQL logs.
* When saving settings in the Management Console, the configuration run would stop if the `enterprise-manage` process was restarted.
* A missing configuration value prevented Dependabot from creating group update pull requests.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* The initial setup certificate generation in AWS took longer than expected due to fallback to private IPs. The time for this fallback has been reduced.
* If the primary instance was unreachable, running `ghe-repl-stop --force` on a replica would fail during the config apply run.
* When restoring from a backup, repositories that had been deleted in the last 90 days were not completely restored.
* Restoring Git repositories using backup-utils occasionally failed.
* Organizations were limited to using 100 Actions organization variables instead of 1,000.
* Some customers upgrading from 3.12 to 3.13 or to 3.14 may experience issues with undecryptable records during the upgrade. This issue has now been resolved. We recommend you read [Undecryptable records](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/upgrading-your-instance/troubleshooting-upgrades/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#undecryptable-records).
### [3.12.11: Changes](#3.12.11-changes)

* For instances deployed on AWS, the default settings for Chrony NTP synchronization have been aligned with AWS's suggested default configurations.
### [3.12.11: Known issues](#3.12.11-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. See [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track GitHub Advanced Security contributions.
* The `reply.[HOSTNAME]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.

October 10, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.10: Security fixes](#3.12.10-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
### [3.12.10: Bug fixes](#3.12.10-bugs)

* HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
* An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
* The "List teams" API endpoint returning duplicate results when paginating.
* A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
* Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
### [3.12.10: Changes](#3.12.10-changes)

* The `ghe-remove-node` command will display the log file location when running in quiet mode.
* Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
* The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
### [3.12.10: Known issues](#3.12.10-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

## Enterprise Server 3.12.9

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.9](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.9/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.9: Security fixes](#3.12.9-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.12.9: Bug fixes](#3.12.9-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
* After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* Placing Nomad jobs would not allow retries in cases when Nomad wasnt available yet.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* After a user created a Projects Insights chart with time as the X-axis, the chart became hidden and inaccessible.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* A bug introduced in 3.12 which prevented the search input in the global navigation from displaying a dropdown of search suggestions has been fixed. The search input functionality prior to 3.12 has been restored, and users are once again able to see and submit suggested search queries, including scope suggestions.
* When a GitHub App installation had all repositories installed individually, it was not possible to remove the repositories from the selection.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`. Outdated alerts caused by edits during custom pattern backfills have been fixed in version 3.13 and above.
### [3.12.9: Changes](#3.12.9-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.12.9: Known issues](#3.12.9-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time.

## Enterprise Server 3.12.8

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.8](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.8/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.8: Features](#3.12.8-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.12.8: Security fixes](#3.12.8-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could update the `title`, `assignees`, and `labels` of any issue inside a public repository. This was only exploitable inside a public repository, and private/internal repositories were not affected. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-7711](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-7711) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.8: Bug fixes](#3.12.8-bugs)

* During hotpatching and sometimes when applying configuration changes, a configuration run to upgrade the GitHub Actions service was unnecessarily triggered. The GitHub Actions service will only be upgraded in GitHub Enterprise Server feature releases.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Upgrading the Dependency Graph sometimes failed due to outdated data from `go.sum` manifests.
* Restarting the `resolvconf` service would not correctly update the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* The `ghe-migrations` utility for visualizing migrations did not work due to a regression. Administrators can now run `ghe-migrations` to view the progress and status of `github` migrations, or run `ghe-migrations --all` to view progress on all services.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* During support bundle generation or when running `ghe-diagnostics`, filesystem usage for the Elasticsearch data directory was not be included.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Site administrators could not switch maintenance mode directly from "scheduled" to "on," or vice versa.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* On the repository settings page for GitHub Pages, users saw an option to upgrade to GitHub Enterprise to use GitHub Pages with private visibility.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, images served from a subdomain or external source did not render correctly in issues opened in the Projects side panel.
* In tag input fields, such as when adding topics to a repository, pressing space did not start a new tag.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The wrong help link was displayed when push protection blocked a secret from the CLI.
* For repositories with issues disabled, issue links were redirected to pull requests.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* In custom pre-receive hooks, the paths stored in environment variables that allow for newly pushed objects to be in a quarantine directory could be incorrectly interpreted as relative to a worktree instead of the Git directory, causing certain commands to fail to read from the repository. The variables now use absolute paths.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
### [3.12.8: Changes](#3.12.8-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* When running `ghe-support-bundle`, the support bundle includes the Elasticsearch config.
* Users can set their styling preference for link underlines in the web interface, on their "Accessibility" settings page.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.12.8: Known issues](#3.12.8-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* The global search bar does not have suggestions enabled due to the redesigned navigation and pending new search experience.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* On boot, the `resolvconf` service may fail to start because the `/run/resolvconf` directory does not exist when the service attempts to `touch` a file there, with the error:

  ```
  /bin/touch: cannot touch '/run/resolvconf/postponed-update': No such file or directory

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue with the following commands — this change will persist on reboots, but not upgrades:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak \
  '/\[Service\]/a ExecStartPre\=\/bin\/mkdir \-p \/run\/resolvconf' \
  /etc/systemd/system/resolvconf.service.d/local.conf

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start resolvconf

  ```

  [Updated: 2024-08-26]
### [3.12.8: Errata](#3.12.8-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.8 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.12.7](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes#3.12.7-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.12.7

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.7](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.7/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.12.6**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

### [3.12.7: Security fixes](#3.12.7-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.7: Bug fixes](#3.12.7-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command could be run on instance configurations other than high-availability clusters, resulting in an incorrect or incomplete status.
* The threshold set by `server_rejoin_age_max` for single-node GHES deployments was too low.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In a high availablity configuration, running `ghe-repl-node` multiple times from a node that did not have replication running had the potential to overwrite the configuration on the primary node.
* Configuration history is only generated for instances in a cluster, high availability (HA) cluster, or standalone HA configuration. The current node must be a primary or replica node with replication running.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On certain branch names, the branch info bar was causing frozen string errors.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* On instances with SCIM enabled, the administrator was unable to view users without an external identity record (for example, because they were provisioned before SCIM was enabled on the instance) in stafftools.
* After navigating to a discussion, the link underline for the Discussions tab in the GitHub UI incorrectly appeared under the Settings tab heading.
* On instances enrolled in the SCIM private beta, built-in authentication users can be added to organizations and teams. Organization owners will no longer see the misleading message that the organization membership is managed by the SAML identity provider when updating organization memberships.
* Enterprise owners managed by an identity provider were asked to authenticate within GitHub when performing privileged actions.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* The `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` could not initialize in some cases, resulting in an exception when handling the error.
* In the sidebar menu that is displayed when a user clicks their profile picture, users who are not enterprise owners saw an "Enterprise settings" option, linking to the main page of an enterprise. This option is now labeled "Your enterprise".
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* When including a `.gitignore` or `README.md` file on repository creation failed due to a ruleset or pre-receive hook, no error message displayed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, requests to the `/enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/advanced-security` REST API endpoint could fail due to timeout.
* On some instances, users were unable to save historical insights charts for Projects.
* The setting to enable or view non-provider patterns was not available for public repositories.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, commits made by users who do not belong to an organization were not counted.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a Git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, contributions were not tracked on public repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the "adjust configuration" step failed when enabling code scanning with the default setup on self-hosted Windows runners.
* Migration of the `issue_edits` table caused intermittent failures during the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.12, resulting in the error message `ActiveRecord::ConcurrentMigrationError: Failed to release advisory lock.` [Updated: 2024-08-14]
### [3.12.7: Changes](#3.12.7-changes)

* In a high availability configuration, users can only run `ghe-config-apply` or `ghe-cluster-config-apply` on a replica node if replication is already running (from `ghe-repl-start`). If replication isnt running on the node, the user will be instructed to start replication.
* Configuration history has been extended. When `ghe-config-apply`, `ghe-cluster-config-apply`, or `ghe-config-archive` is run: `secrets.conf` is captured, a sha256sum for each of the current configuration files is included, the existing patch that is generated includes `secrets.conf`, and an additional sanitized patch that excludes `secrets.conf` is also generated.
* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* A more specific error message is shown when a non-provisioned user tried to sign in to an instance with SCIM enabled.
* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
* A more specific error message is shown when a deprovisioned user attempts signing into an instance with SCIM enabled.
* In the audit logs, administrators can see more context for failed user authentication attempts using LDAP.
* The system logs provide more context for authentication failures related to multi-factor authentication.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
* To avoid excessive log volume and associated disk pressure, requests for `GetCacheKey` are no longer logged. Previously, the high frequency of these requests caused significant log accumulation.
### [3.12.7: Known issues](#3.12.7-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* *Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.*
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

### [3.12.3: Security fixes](#3.12.3-security-fixes)

* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated in the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.3: Bug fixes](#3.12.3-bugs)

* Running `ghe-repl-node -d` did not validate value length in order to prevent values longer than 20 characters.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-repl-setup` did not successfully complete on a replica due to a missing key.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration, during the migration phase of a configuration run, the process of copying configuration updates to all nodes would fail.
* Admins in the `actions` organization were excluded from license consumption, causing incorrect license counts.
* An LDAP-related error message was incorrectly displayed at the enterprise and organization levels.

* External collaborators with read-only access were able to run workflows on their pull requests from private forks without approval.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering.
### [3.12.3: Changes](#3.12.3-changes)

* To aid in understanding the CPU/memory utilization of secret scanning processes, the binary names of nomad workers were updated to differentiate between the different types of secret scanning jobs.
* A more specific error message is shown when the `ghe-repl-node` command is run on an instance not configured for high availability.
* The SCIM private beta has resumed with support from GitHub engineering in GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.11 and later.

### [3.12.2: Security fixes](#3.12.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the editor role in the Management Console could gain administrative SSH access to the appliance by command injection when configuring the chat integration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-3646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). The editor role has been deprecated. For more information, see the "Changes" section of these release notes.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring Artifact & Logs and Migrations Storage. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3684](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3684) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with a deploy key for an organization-owned repository could bypass a ruleset that specified organization administrators as bypass actors. Exploitation would require an attacker to already have access to a valid deploy key for a repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3470](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3470) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a detached repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions while the repository is detached. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2440) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.2: Bug fixes](#3.12.2-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability replication enabled, Git operations for existing repositories would fail after failover to the replica cluster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover). [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* A Redis job had a memory limit that was too low in some cases, leading the process to run out of memory.
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* The `/` keyboard shortcut did not display the search field in the web UI.
* On an instance where Dependabot alerts are or were enabled, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.12 could fail and require intervention from GitHub Support.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* Setting a maintenance message failed if the message contained a multibyte character.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
* On an instance with repository caching configured, adding new repositories to a cache node sometimes failed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, after enabling secret scanning for the first time for an organization or the instance, the historical backfills for alerts in existing repositories issues did not appear.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, alert counts for secret type on the secret scanning alerts page, as well as metrics for custom patterns, were incorrect.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
### [3.12.2: Changes](#3.12.2-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
### [3.12.2: Known issues](#3.12.2-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.1/download)

March 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.12.1: Security fixes](#3.12.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could execute CSRF attacks to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user, using the GraphQL mutations. A mitigating factor is that user interaction is required. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2748](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2748) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.12.1: Bug fixes](#3.12.1-bugs)

* On an instance in a high availability or cluster configuration, configuring `fluent-bit` on a primary node returned an empty `primary_host` value.
* When an administrator performed certain operations related to an instance's storage, the user disk would fail to unmount.
* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-remove-node` utility allowed accidental removal of a node with the `redis-master` role.
* If an administrator lost SSH access to an instance, authentication from the hypervisor console using the password for the root site administrator would fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* After an administrator runs `gh es config apply` using the GitHub CLI, the output includes a run ID.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instances HTTP timeouts.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* Improved error handling for domain verification.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the security overview did not display updated alert counts for code scanning immediately after the completion of analysis.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* Unauthenticated requests to the REST APIs `/search/code` endpoint returned erroneous rate-limit values.
* On an instance with SAML authentication configured, users with a SAML mapping were able to configure two-factor authentication (2FA).
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* Some pages in the settings for the instances enterprise account contained a link that responded with a `404 Not Found` error.
* When viewing a file in the instance's web interface, the "Copy lines" and "Copy permalink" interactions did not copy content to the clipboard.
* The landing page for the site admin dashboard did not render details about the instance's enterprise account.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, repositories with generic secret detection or non-provider pattern scanning enabled wouldn't see the results of scans for secrets.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the patterns alerts.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the speed of migration for code scanning analyses is increased during an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or earlier.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, weekly scheduled runs for code scanning's default setup might not occur.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, a user with read-only access to a repository could adjust severity settings for code scanning.
### [3.12.1: Changes](#3.12.1-changes)

* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see [Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding).
  Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see [Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) and [REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/rest/commits).
### [3.12.1: Known issues](#3.12.1-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).

## Enterprise Server 3.12.0

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.0](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.12.0/download)

March 05, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.12.13) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server).

### [3.12.0: Features](#3.12.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + To ensure an instance's readiness for an upgrade to a new feature release of GitHub Enterprise Server, administrators can ensure that background tasks from a previous upgrade are complete using the `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command-line utility. For more information, see [Upgrading with an upgrade package](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/upgrading-your-instance/performing-an-upgrade/upgrading-with-an-upgrade-package#upgrading-a-standalone-instance-using-an-upgrade-package) and [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs).
  + When backing up an instance in a cluster configuration using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, the pre-flight routine includes a health check for all nodes and notifies administrators of any issues before the backup begins.
  + The REST API's `/manage/v1` endpoints have been expanded to include all the same operations as the `/setup/api` endpoints. The `/setup/api` endpoints will be deprecated in a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see the following articles in the REST API documentation.

    - [REST API endpoints for managing GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes)
    - [REST API endpoints for Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console)
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can use the `ghe-remove-node` command-line utility to remove a node from a cluster. This command evacuates data from the node's data services, marks the node as offline, and stops traffic being routed to the node, replacing the manual steps previously required to remove a node. For more information, see [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-remove-node). [Updated: 2024-02-28]
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can more easily configure or tear down a high availability replica of the cluster. For more information, see the documentation for the following utilities in the "Command-line utilities" article:

    - [`ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap`](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap)
    - [`ghe-cluster-repl-teardown`](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-repl-teardown)

    [Updated: 2024-03-25]
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + To manage work across different accounts and GitHub products, users can authenticate to the GitHub CLI with multiple accounts, then use the `gh auth switch` command to switch between active accounts. For more information, see [gh auth login](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) in the GitHub CLI manual.
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + The GitHub Advanced Security billing REST API and CSV download includes the email addresses for active committers. This provides information for insights into Advanced Security license usage across your business. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for enterprise billing](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/rest/enterprise-admin/billing) and [Viewing your GitHub Advanced Security usage](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/viewing-your-github-advanced-security-usage#downloading-github-advanced-security-license-usage-information).
  + To make it easier for users to secure repositories, default setup for code scanning automatically attempts to analyze all languages supported by CodeQL. Users no longer need to manually include analysis of C, C++, C#, Java, or Kotlin when enabling default setup, and organization owners and security managers can enable analysis of these languages for multiple repositories in an organization. For more information about the languages and versions supported by CodeQL and code scanning, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning) and [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + Customers who use both GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud can ensure license usage for GitHub Advanced Security is calculated correctly by synchronizing license usage across deployments. Synchronization can be performed automatically, using GitHub Connect, or manually, using an export file. For more information, see [Syncing license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud).
  + For code scanning, this release of GitHub Enterprise Server uses version 2.15.5 of CodeQL by default. This version of CodeQL includes more up-to-date support for various languages, including C# 12, .NET 8, TypeScript 5.3, Java 21, and Python 3.12. For more information, see the [changelog for CodeQL 2.15.5](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.15.5/) in the CodeQL documentation.
  + Code scanning with CodeQL has improved support for detecting vulnerabilities in C and C++ code, with queries available for detecting common memory-corruption vulnerabilities. These queries are in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [ICYMI: improved C++ vulnerability coverage and CodeQL support for Lombok](https://github.blog/2023-10-19-icymi-improved-c-vulnerability-coverage-and-codeql-support-for-lombok/#improved-c-vulnerability-coverage) on the GitHub Blog.
  + For repositories migrated to GitHub Enterprise Server from other platforms, to calculate active committers for GitHub Advanced Security license usage, GitHub only considers commits made after the migration date. Previously, historic commits were included in the calculation, and users needed to intervene manually to avoid consuming licenses unnecessarily. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Advanced Security](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security).
  + To make the language overview on the tool status page more informative, users can directly specify `Kotlin`, `C`, and `TypeScript` as languages to be analyzed using the `language` property of a `codeql.yml` file. For example: `language: [ 'kotlin' ]`. These languages were already supported by CodeQL, but were previously treated as being part of the `Java`, `CPP`, and `JavaScript` languages respectively.
  + To increase the coverage of secret scanning without needing to maintain custom patterns, users can configure secret scanning to detect non-provider patterns. Non-provider patterns are patterns such as private keys that tend to have a higher rate of false positives than high-confidence patterns. GitHub displays non-provider alerts in a different list from high-confidence alerts, making triaging a better experience for users. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Managing alerts from secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning#managing-alerts-from-non-provider-patterns).
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + To debug issues with Dependabot, users can view logs for Dependabot job runs associated with version updates, security updates, and rebase updates. For more information, see [Viewing Dependabot job logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/code-security/dependabot/troubleshooting-dependabot/viewing-dependabot-job-logs).
  + Users can choose how to respond to Dependabot alerts automatically by setting up custom auto-triage rules in repositories or organizations. Auto-triage rules provide control over whether an alert is ignored, is snoozed, or triggers a pull request for a security update. Users can also use a rule created by GitHub to automatically dismiss low-impact issues in npm dependencies. Auto-triage rules are in public beta and subject to change. For more information, see [About Dependabot auto-triage rules](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-auto-triage-rules/about-dependabot-auto-triage-rules).
  + Dependabot version updates have improved support for dependencies in NuGet, the package manager for .NET. Improvements include better support for implicit dependencies and peer dependencies. For more information about supported package managers, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems).
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.311.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.311.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + Users can set up organization-wide rules to enforce their CI/CD workflows, ensuring workflows pass before pull requests can be merged into target repositories. You can fine-tune your rule by selecting a specific branch, tag, or SHA, and provide maximum control over the version expected to run. To reduce risk, you can "evaluate" workflow rules to validate rules are working correctly. For more information, see [Available rules for rulesets](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#require-workflows-to-pass-before-merging).
  + GitHub Actions developers can use GitHub Actions Importer to plan, forecast, and automate the migration of existing CI/CD pipelines from Bamboo Server, Bamboo Data Center, and Bitbucket. Developers can migrate their Bamboo and Bitbucket pipelines to GitHub Actions using the GitHub CLI or IssueOps. For more information, see [Migrating from Bitbucket Pipelines with GitHub Actions Importer](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/automated-migrations/migrating-from-bitbucket-pipelines-with-github-actions-importer) and [Migrating from Bamboo with GitHub Actions Importer](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/automated-migrations/migrating-from-bamboo-with-github-actions-importer).
  + Actions environments support defining selected tag patterns to restrict deployments. Administrators who want to have more secure and controlled deployments can specify selected tags or tag patterns on their protected environments. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches).
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + To tailor information to users' needs, users are prompted to sign in to access the [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/) portal. For customers with an enterprise account on GitHub.com, we encourage users to sign in to an account with support privileges for the enterprise. For more information, see [Managing support entitlements for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-support-entitlements-for-your-enterprise). Users who cannot sign in to an account on GitHub.com can still access the portal by verifying an email address.
  + To help users find answers to their questions more quickly, GitHub Copilot is integrated into GitHub Support. Users can choose to chat with Copilot instead of creating a ticket on the [Get help with GitHub](https://support.github.com/contact) contact form. Copilot has been trained on the GitHub Enterprise Server documentation on GitHub Docs. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Project templates for organizations are generally available. Users in an organization can create a template to share a pre-configured project with other people in your organization as the base for their projects. For more information, see [Managing project templates in your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization).
  + Users can access Projects from from the global navigation menu. This page can be used to find projects you've recently viewed or created, regardless of the organization or where they are located. For more information, see [Finding your projects](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/finding-your-projects).
* #### [GitHub Discussions](#github-discussions)

  + Users can filter for answered or unanswered discussions with the GraphQL API by using the `answered` property. For more information, see [Using the GraphQL API for Discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/graphql/guides/using-the-graphql-api-for-discussions).
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Users can merge pull requests without needing to wait for status checks to pass by adding a pull request to a merge queue. The merge queue ensures that the changes in the pull request will pass all required status checks when applied to the latest version of the target branch. A pull request is merged automatically once it reaches the front of the queue. This feature is particularly useful on branches where pull requests are merged frequently. For more information, see [Managing a merge queue](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue).
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Users can highlight information using Markdown alerts. Alerts are displayed with distinctive colors and icons, and include notes, tips, warnings, and more. For more information, see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts).
* #### [Accessibility](#accessibility)

  + The web interface for GitHub Enterprise Server has been redesigned to provide a more intuitive, responsive, and accessible navigation experience. Changes include:

    - Breadcrumbs to help users navigate the site more efficiently
    - Menus to quickly access a user's top repositories and teams
    - A more accessible navigation experience, including more consistent keyboard navigation and improvements to code search

    For more information, see [Exploring GitHub with the redesigned navigation](https://github.blog/2023-06-15-exploring-github-with-the-redesigned-navigation-now-in-public-beta/) on the GitHub Blog. Note that the redesigned navigation is now generally available.
  + The comment field in issues, discussions, and pull requests has been redesigned for easier use across different screen sizes, and for better integration with assistive technology such as keyboard navigation and screen readers.
### [3.12.0: Changes](#3.12.0-changes)

* Field names for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed as part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Additional field names were changed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see [About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal).

  For a full list of mappings, download the OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server [3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), [3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), [3.11](/assets/ghes-3.11-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv), and [3.12](/assets/ghes-3-12-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv).
* On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security and code scanning enabled, the bot that posts comments and annotations for code scanning alerts on pull requests has been renamed from `github-code-scanning` to `github-advanced-security`.
* The REST API's `/rate_limit` endpoint is now subject to rate limits. Requests will not consume the primary rate limit quotas for the authenticated user. However, making a very high number of requests in a short period of time will trigger the secondary rate limits if secondary rate limits are enabled on your instance. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/rest/rate-limit/rate-limit) in the REST API documentation and [Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits).
* TCP port 9103 is opened for future administrative features related to support for Prometheus scraping.
### [3.12.0: Known issues](#3.12.0-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* After failing over an instance in a cluster configuration, Git pushes to the instance will fail. This issue impacts pushes from the command line as well as the web interface. To resolve this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.12.0: Deprecations](#3.12.0-deprecations)

* #### [Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities using a Git repository is no longer supported](#upgrading-github-enterprise-server-backup-utilities-using-a-git-repository-is-no-longer-supported)

  + The ability to upgrade the GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities tool using a Git repository has been removed following changes to the [github/backup-utils repository](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/releases). For more information about the repository changes, see [Repository updates - November 2023](https://github.com/github/backup-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#repository-updates---november-2023) in the project's README.

    Instead, to upgrade the tool using a compressed archive, download the relevant GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities release from the [Releases](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/releases) page of the `github/backup-utils` repository. For more information, see [Configuring backups on your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/backing-up-and-restoring-your-instance/configuring-backups-on-your-instance#upgrading-github-enterprise-server-backup-utilities).

    This deprecation does not affect the functionality of the GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities tool or your ability to backup or restore your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. [Updated: 2024-03-15]

## Enterprise Server 3.14.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.14.6/download)

December 17, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.14.6: Security fixes](#3.14.6-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.14.6: Bug fixes](#3.14.6-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, `ghe-repl-promote` failed if the primary node was unavailable.
* In a high availability configuration, with GitHub Actions, replication would fail on nodes where MSSQL was not configured to run.
* The `--no-async` flag was not implemented for the `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, leading to a potentially increased load.
* Pre-receive hook environments with shared memory enabled could not access shared memory at runtime.
* For instances hosted on Azure, if a pre-upgrade check failed due to insufficient user disk size, the Management Console displayed an internal server error.
* The Enterprise Overview page incorrectly displayed a Beta label, even though it is generally available.
* After a user made changes to the isolated subdomain setting, some user assets did not display properly.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, when selecting repositories for a dry run of an enterprise-level custom pattern, searches for full repository names (`ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY`) did not return results.
* When adding bypass permissions to a ruleset, the dropdown menu failed to load if one of the suggested actors was an invalid integration.
* When creating a pre-receive hook environment, attempts to include an image URL over 255 characters failed with a database error. The maximum length is still 255 characters, but the URL length is now validated before the process starts.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions disabled, status check icons on a repositorys commit list failed to render.
* Site administrators were unable to use the "Disable repository access" functionality on the site admin dashboard.
* Attempting to access the code security settings page for a non-existent enterprise returned a 500 error instead of a 404 error.
* Performing a browser back navigation to a pull request now displays up-to-date status checks.
* Jekyll-build tooling for GitHub pages could fail when using the `jekyll-relative-links` plugin, see [Failure details](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9544).
* The removal rate of issues from Git repositories was slower than necessary.
### [3.14.6: Changes](#3.14.6-changes)

* Log output for git maintenance now includes the time taken to complete the maintenance process.
* When exporting repositories to blob storage using the migrations REST API endpoint to start an organization migration, the maximum compressed archive size is limited to 90 GB. This is an increase from 30 GB.
* Removes the minimum date for the new commit filter bar.
* When exporting repositories using the migrations REST API, prior to blob storage upload the tarball is staged in the root volume. For more disk capacity, the tarball will now be staged in the data volume.
### [3.14.6: Known issues](#3.14.6-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
* When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.14.6) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.14.5: Security fixes](#3.14.5-security-fixes)

* **LOW**: Instance administrators could see tokens used to authenticate against gitauth in plaintext in`/var/log/github-audit.log`.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

## Enterprise Server 3.14.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.14.3/download)

November 07, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.14.6) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.14.3: Security fixes](#3.14.3-security-fixes)

* Elasticsearch packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security version.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This is a follow up fix for [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487) to further harden the encrypted assertions feature against this type of attack. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document to exploit this vulnerability.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with Enterprise Administrator access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance could escalate privileges to SSH root access. This is achieved by exploiting the pre-receive hook environment to bypass symlink checks in the `ghe-firejail` path and execute malicious scripts. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10007](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-10007) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.14.3: Bug fixes](#3.14.3-bugs)

* When saving settings in the Management Console, the configuration run would stop if the `enterprise-manage` process was restarted.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* A repeated error message concerning connectivity to port 6002 was emitted to the system logs when GitHub Actions was enabled.
* The initial setup certificate generation in AWS took longer than expected due to fallback to private IPs. The time for this fallback has been reduced.
* The `ghe-support-bundle` generation would fail when the `aqueduct-lite` service is down.
* If the primary instance was unreachable, running `ghe-repl-stop --force` on a replica would fail during the config apply run.
* Administrators in the SCIM private beta (versions < 3.14) that decided to upgrade their private beta appliance see an incorrectly checked box in the "SCIM Configuration" section of the Enterprise settings authentication security page in 3.14.
* Certain URLs may have caused a 500 error on instances that use the mandatory message feature logging.
* When restoring from a backup, repositories that had been deleted in the last 90 days were not completely restored.
* For instances that use secret scanning, custom messages for push protection set by the enterprise did not display to users.
* Restoring Git repositories using `backup-utils` occasionally failed.
* Enterprise installations experienced unpredictable repository search results due to the default 4,000 repository limit. A relaxed repository filter mode, which includes all single-tenant organization repositories and bypasses the limit, has been introduced. Administrators can enable this mode using `ghe-config app.github.enterprise-repo-search-filter-enabled true && ghe-config-apply`.
* Running `config-apply` became stuck under certain circumstances due to a misconfiguration with Packages and Elasticsearch.
* Audit log events for secret scanning alerts incorrectly displayed a blank secret type when generated for a custom pattern.
* Some customers upgrading to 3.14 may experience issues with undecryptable records during the upgrade. This issue has now been resolved. We recommend you read [Undecryptable records](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/upgrading-your-instance/troubleshooting-upgrades/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#undecryptable-records).
### [3.14.3: Changes](#3.14.3-changes)

* When connecting to an appliance via SSH, a notification about upcoming root disk changes displays.
### [3.14.3: Known issues](#3.14.3-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.

## Enterprise Server 3.14.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.14.2/download)

October 10, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.14.6) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.14.2: Security fixes](#3.14.2-security-fixes)

* A sensitive data exposure in HTML forms was possible in the management console. To mitigate this issue, the "Copy Storage Setting from Actions" functionality was removed from the management console.
* **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
### [3.14.2: Bug fixes](#3.14.2-bugs)

* A missing configuration value would cause Dependabot to be unable to create group update pull requests.
* HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
* This error message `mbind: Operation not permitted` was repeatedly showing in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` MySQL logs.
* The backup of audit logs could take longer after upgrading to Elasticsearch 8.
* An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
* Users were unable to sign out from gist pages.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
* Suspended users were not always correctly routed to the correct "suspended" page.
* The "List teams" API endpoint returned duplicate results when paginating.
* When managing the organization permissions required for fine-grained personal access tokens, for custom properties or projects, the `Admin` access level could not be selected.
* A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
* The `ghe-spokesctl status` command showed repaired repositories as broken if their network ID changed during the repair (for example, when the repository was detached from it's original network).
* Missing URLs on import could lead to migration failures without logging or explanation.
* On the security overview dashboard, data initialization could fail when creating new organizations or changing GitHub Advanced Security licensing.
* Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
### [3.14.2: Changes](#3.14.2-changes)

* `ghe-remove-node` will display the log file location when running in quiet mode.
* Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
* The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
### [3.14.2: Known issues](#3.14.2-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* The admin stats REST API endpoints may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors.

## Enterprise Server 3.14.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.14.1/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.14.6) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.14.1: Security fixes](#3.14.1-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.14.1: Bug fixes](#3.14.1-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
* After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
* Some pre-receive hooks using the `faccessat2` system call, such as those using Alpine Linux as the base, failed unexpectedly.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* In organizations with a large number of repositories, when an administrator used repository properties to target repositories in an organization ruleset, the ruleset index page timed out.
* After a user created a Projects Insights chart with time as the X-axis, the chart became hidden and inaccessible.
* Fixes a known issue where some links to GitHub Docs from GitHub Enterprise Server may lead to a “Page not found.” Previously, the links incorrectly added `enterprise-cloud@latest` to the URL.
* A bug introduced in 3.12 which prevented the search input in the global navigation from displaying a dropdown of search suggestions has been fixed. The search input functionality prior to 3.12 has been restored, and users are once again able to see and submit suggested search queries, including scope suggestions.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* The Secret Scanning Push Protection custom resource link set at the Enterprise level was not being displayed to users being blocked when pushing secrets to a repository using git through the command line interface.
* Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-09-27]
### [3.14.1: Changes](#3.14.1-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
* Site administrators can now configure the instance with NUMA optimizations.
### [3.14.1: Known issues](#3.14.1-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
* When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* Images embedded in wiki pages may stop rendering shortly after being published. [Updated: 2024-10-16]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

## Enterprise Server 3.14.0

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.0](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.14.0/download)

August 27, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.14.6) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/overview-of-the-upgrade-process).

### [3.14.0: Features](#3.14.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + On an instance with multiple replica nodes, to start or stop replication for all nodes in a single configuration run, administrators can use the `ghe-repl-start-all` and `ghe-repl-stop-all` commands.
* #### [Instance services](#instance-services)

  + Administrators can scale the appliance using generation 2 virtual machines, with support for booting in UEFI mode. This requires deploying a new instance and restoring data onto it. See [Using generation 2 virtual machines](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/using-generation-2-virtual-machines).
  + Nomad has been upgraded to 1.5.17 and Consul has been upgraded to 1.17.4. These services are used in GitHub Enterprise Server to orchestrate containers and configuration.
* #### [Identity and access management](#identity-and-access-management)

  + Automated user provisioning via the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard is available in public beta. Instances that use SAML authentication can enable SCIM to provision user accounts and manage their lifecycle from an identity provider (IdP). You can configure SCIM using an application for supported IdPs, or using the REST API endpoints for SCIM. See [Configuring user provisioning with SCIM on GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/user-provisioning-with-scim-on-ghes).

    - If your instance already uses SAML, you will need to configure a new IdP application that supports automated provisioning via SCIM.
    - Existing private beta customers should also reconfigure their implementation with an updated application.
    - During the public beta, we recommend testing SCIM support for your identity system in a non-production instance before adding SCIM to your current setup.
  + Organization owners can create and assign custom organization roles, delegating administrative duties to trusted teams and users. See [Managing custom organization roles](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-organization-roles).
  + Users can use the account switcher to switch between multiple accounts. See [Switching between accounts](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/switching-between-accounts).
  + On an instance that uses built-in authentication, users can use passkeys to sign in securely to GitHub, without needing to input their password. See [Authenticating with a passkey](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey).
  + Enterprises that use an SSH certificate authority can allow SSH certificates to be used to access user-owned repositories. See [Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#managing-access-to-user-owned-repositories).
* #### [Audit logs](#audit-logs)

  + Every 24 hours, a health check runs for each audit log stream. If a stream is set up incorrectly, an email will be sent to the enterprise owners as notification that their audit log stream is not properly configured.
* #### [Secret scanning](#secret-scanning)

  + Users can specify which teams or roles have the ability to bypass push protection. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See [About push protection](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations#enabling-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection).
  + Secret scanning detects secrets leaked in discussions and in pull request titles, bodies, and comments. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See [About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning).
  + Secret scanning blocks contributors from uploading files with detected secrets if push protection is enabled for a repository. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
  + Audit log events are created when secret scanning non-provider patterns are enabled or disabled at the repository, organization, or enterprise level.
* #### [Code scanning](#code-scanning)

  + Users can create a dedicated code scanning rule to block pull request merges, instead of relying on status checks. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See [Set code scanning merge protection](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/set-code-scanning-merge-protection).
  + Users can use CodeQL threat model settings for C# to adapt CodeQL's code scanning analysis to detect the most relevant security vulnerabilities in their code. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See [Editing your configuration of default setup](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#including-local-sources-of-tainted-data-in-default-setup).
  + Organizations that use default setup for code scanning can use organization-level model packs to extend the coverage of multiple repositories. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See [Editing your configuration of default setup](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup).
  + CodeQL can scan Java projects without a build. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
  + This release comes installed with version **2.17.6** of the CodeQL CLI, used in the CodeQL action for code scanning. Significant updates since the default version installed on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13 include:

    - Support for Java 22, Swift 5.10, TS 5.4, and C# 12
    - New queries for C/C++, Go, Java, and Ruby:
      * `cpp/type-confusion`: Detects casts to invalid types
      * `cpp/iterator-to-expired-container`: Detects the creation of iterators owned by temporary objects that are about to be destroyed
      * `go/uncontrolled-allocation-size`: Detects slice memory allocation with excessive size value
      * `java/unvalidated-url-forward`: Prevents information disclosure caused by unsafe URL construction
      * `rb/insecure-mass-assignment`: Detects instances of mass assignment operations accepting arbitrary parameters
      * `rb/csrf-protection-not-enabled`: Detects cases where Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is not enabled in Ruby on Rails controllers
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + Users can consolidate Dependabot pull requests by enabling grouped security updates for related dependencies in a package ecosystem. See [About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-grouped-security-updates).
  + Dependabot can access Cargo private registries to provide updates to Rust dependencies. See [Guidance for the configuration of private registries for Dependabot](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/guidance-for-the-configuration-of-private-registries-for-dependabot#about-configuring-private-registries-for-dependabot).
  + Dependabot pauses scheduled jobs after 15 failures. This gives an earlier indication of potential issues while still ensuring that critical security updates continue to be applied without interruption.
  + Dependabot uses private registry configurations specified in the `dependabot.yml` file as expected, even if there is a configuration with `target-branch`. This ensures that security updates are applied correctly, regardless of your repository's configuration settings. See [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot).
  + In the `dependabot.yml` file, users can apply the same configuration to manifest files from multiple directories using the `directories` key. Direct strings, glob syntax, and wildcards (`*`) are all supported for targeting directories. See [Dependabot options reference](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference#directories). [Updated: 2024-10-07]
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + The security overview dashboard, with the ability to view secret scanning metrics and trending data for the enablement of security features, is available at the enterprise level. See [Viewing security insights](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights).
  + The security overview dashboard for organizations is now generally available.
  + On the security overview dashboard, users can view alert trends grouped by tool. The group-by option is designed to improve the ability to track and analyze the effectiveness of scanning tools, enabling more strategic decision-making. See [Viewing security insights](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights#viewing-the-security-overview-dashboard-for-your-organization).
  + On the security overview dashboard, users can filter by security tool. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
  + In the dependency graph, a software bill of materials (SBOM) generated for a package now includes the package URL for more packages. Previously, the package URL was not included if the manifest file referenced a package with a version range.
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.317.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.317.0). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release.
  + Deployment views across environments are now generally available. Users can pin environments and use additional filters to filter the views. See [Viewing deployment history](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/actions/deployment/managing-your-deployments/viewing-deployment-history).
* #### [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)

  + Users can configure custom GitHub Actions workflows to build and deploy sites on GitHub Pages. See [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Users can enhance security by adding deploy keys as a bypass type to rulesets. See [Creating rulesets for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-branch-or-tag-ruleset).
  + Users can select Dependabot in the bypass list of a ruleset. See [Creating rulesets for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-push-ruleset).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Users can use the auto-close issue workflow to automatically close issues when a project item moves to a specific "completed" status. See [Using the built-in automations](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-built-in-automations).
* #### [Integrations and extensions](#integrations-and-extensions)

  + When authenticating to a native GitHub App or OAuth app, users will be prompted to select which account they want to sign in to using an account picker. Developers of apps can append `?prompt=select_account` to their login flow to show users the account picker.
  + When using a JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate or request an installation token, developers of GitHub Apps can use the app's client ID for the JWT's `iss` claim. The application ID remains valid, but is considered deprecated.
### [3.14.0: Known issues](#3.14.0-known-issues)

* Complete SCIM payloads are written to the audit log, including SCIM attributes that are not required or supported per [API docs](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/rest/enterprise-admin/scim?apiVersion=2022-11-28#supported-scim-user-attributes). Customers using Okta with SCIM may notice that a placeholder password attribute is among the data passed to audit logs in its current configuration. This placeholder data is associated with Okta’s password synchronization feature that is not expected or required by GitHub. See [okta-scim](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-scim/guides/scim-20/#create-the-user) for more information.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In some situations, large `.adoc` files stored in a repository do not render properly in the web UI. The raw contents are still available to view as plaintext.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* REST API endpoints for admin stats may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shut down the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* The global search bar does not have suggestions enabled due to the redesigned navigation and pending new search experience.
* Upgrades include an error concerning `Error deregistering job` for `consul-template`. This message does not indicate any problems with your install and can be safely ignored.
* Some links to GitHub Docs from GitHub Enterprise Server may lead to a "Page not found," because an `enterprise-cloud@latest` portion is incorrectly added to the URL.
* An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
* In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* On boot, the `resolvconf` service may fail to start because the `/run/resolvconf` directory does not exist when the service attempts to `touch` a file there, with the error:

  ```
  /bin/touch: cannot touch '/run/resolvconf/postponed-update': No such file or directory

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue with the following commands — this change will persist on reboots, but not upgrades:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak \
  '/\[Service\]/a ExecStartPre\=\/bin\/mkdir \-p \/run\/resolvconf' \
  /etc/systemd/system/resolvconf.service.d/local.conf

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start resolvconf

  ```
* Services may respond with a 503 status due to an out of date haproxy configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
* Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-09-27]
* Images embedded in wiki pages may stop rendering shortly after being published. [Updated: 2024-10-16]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

  [Updated: 2024-11-29]
### [3.14.0: Deprecations](#3.14.0-deprecations)

* The Manage GHES API reached feature parity with the Management Console API in GHES 3.12. As a result, we will remove the Management Console API in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15. For information about updating tooling that relies on the Management Console API, see [REST API endpoints for Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.14/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console).
### [3.14.0: Errata](#3.14.0-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.0 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included prior to the release of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14.0. [Updated: 2024-09-16]
* These release notes did not include a note for support of the `directories` key in `dependabot.yml` files. [Updated: 2024-10-07]
* The "Changes" section indicated that "Pushes that update over 5,000 branches no longer trigger webhooks or GitHub Actions workflows." The change instead affects GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.15. [Updated: 2024-10-30]

## Enterprise Server 3.13.9

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.9](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.9/download)

December 17, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.9: Security fixes](#3.13.9-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.13.9: Bug fixes](#3.13.9-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, `ghe-repl-promote` failed if the primary node was unavailable.
* In a high availability configuration, with GitHub Actions, replication would fail on nodes where MSSQL was not configured to run.
* The `--no-async` flag was not implemented for the `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, leading to a potentially increased load.
* Pre-receive hook environments with shared memory enabled could not access shared memory at runtime.
* For instances hosted on Azure, if a pre-upgrade check failed due to insufficient user disk size, the Management Console displayed an internal server error.
* The Enterprise Overview page incorrectly displayed a Beta label, even though it is generally available.
* After a user made changes to the isolated subdomain setting, some user assets did not display properly.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, when selecting repositories for a dry run of an enterprise-level custom pattern, searches for full repository names (`ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY`) did not return results.
* When adding bypass permissions to a ruleset, the dropdown menu failed to load if one of the suggested actors was an invalid integration.
* When creating a pre-receive hook environment, attempts to include an image URL over 255 characters failed with a database error. The maximum length is still 255 characters, but the URL length is now validated before the process starts.
* Performing a browser back navigation to a pull request now displays up-to-date status checks.
* Jekyll-build tooling for GitHub pages could fail when using the `jekyll-relative-links` plugin, see [Failure details](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9544).
* Subversion services were non-functional in some cases.
### [3.13.9: Changes](#3.13.9-changes)

* When exporting repositories to blob storage using the migrations REST API endpoint to start an organization migration, the maximum compressed archive size is limited to 90 GB. This is an increase from 30 GB.
* Removes the minimum date for the new commit filter bar.
* When exporting repositories using the migrations REST API, prior to blob storage upload the tarball is staged in the root volume. For more disk capacity, the tarball will now be staged in the data volume.
### [3.13.9: Known issues](#3.13.9-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
## Enterprise Server 3.13.8

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.8](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.8/download)

### [3.13.8: Security fixes](#3.13.8-security-fixes)

* **LOW**: Instance administrators could see tokens used to authenticate against gitauth in plaintext in`/var/log/github-audit.log`.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.13.8: Bug fixes](#3.13.8-bugs)

* Pull request review requests for teams were sometimes not assigned to users correctly, because of a limit on manual review requests.
### [3.13.8: Known issues](#3.13.8-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* Attempting to stop replications after stopping GitHub Actions on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance would fail, reporting that MSSQL was not responding. The can be avoided by start MSSQL prior to stopping replication `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-nomad-jobs queue /etc/nomad-jobs/mssql/mssql.hcl`
## Enterprise Server 3.13.7

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.7](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.7/download)

November 12, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.7: Bug fixes](#3.13.7-bugs)

* Customers performing a feature version upgrade to 3.13.6 or 3.14.3 may experience issues with database migrations due to data issues during database conversions.
### [3.13.7: Known issues](#3.13.7-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

## Enterprise Server 3.13.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.6/download)

November 07, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.6: Security fixes](#3.13.6-security-fixes)

* Elasticsearch packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This is a follow up fix for [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487) to further harden the encrypted assertions feature against this type of attack. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document to exploit this vulnerability.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with Enterprise Administrator access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance could escalate privileges to SSH root access. This is achieved by exploiting the pre-receive hook environment to bypass symlink checks in the `ghe-firejail` path and execute malicious scripts. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10007](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-10007) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.13.6: Bug fixes](#3.13.6-bugs)

* A missing configuration value prevented Dependabot from creating group update pull requests.
* When saving settings in the Management Console, the configuration run would stop if the `enterprise-manage` process was restarted.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* The initial setup certificate generation in AWS took longer than expected due to fallback to private IPs. The time for this fallback has been reduced.
* The `ghe-support-bundle` generation would fail when the `aqueduct-lite` service is down.
* If the primary instance was unreachable, running `ghe-repl-stop --force` on a replica would fail during the config apply run.
* For instances that use the mandatory message feature logging in to certain URLs may have caused a 500 error.
* When restoring from a backup, repositories that had been deleted in the last 90 days were not completely restored.
* Restoring Git repositories using backup-utils occasionally failed.
* Enterprise installations experienced unpredictable repository search results due to the default 4,000 repository limit. A relaxed repository filter mode, which includes all single-tenant organization repositories and bypasses the limit, has been introduced. Administrators can enable this mode using `ghe-config app.github.enterprise-repo-search-filter-enabled true && ghe-config-apply`.
* Organizations were limited to using 100 Actions organization variables instead of 1,000.
* Running `config-apply` became stuck under certain circumstances due to a misconfiguration with Packages and Elasticsearch.
* Some customers upgrading to 3.13 may experience issues with undecryptable records during the upgrade. This issue has now been resolved. We recommend you read [Undecryptable records](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/upgrading-your-instance/troubleshooting-upgrades/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#undecryptable-records).
### [3.13.6: Changes](#3.13.6-changes)

* When connecting to an appliance via SSH, a notification about upcoming root disk changes displays.
### [3.13.6: Known issues](#3.13.6-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. See [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track GitHub Advanced Security contributions.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a `config apply` as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* Customers doing feature version upgrade to 3.13.6 may experience issues with database migrations due to data issues during database conversions. [Added: 2024-11-08]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

## Enterprise Server 3.13.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.5/download)

October 10, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.5: Security fixes](#3.13.5-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
### [3.13.5: Bug fixes](#3.13.5-bugs)

* HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, internal jobs were created and not processed, which could contribute to performance issues.
* This error message `mbind: Operation not permitted` was repeatedly showing in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` MySQL logs.
* The backup of audit log could take longer after upgrading to Elasticsearch 8.
* An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
* Users were unable to sign out from gist pages.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
* The "List teams" API endpoint returning duplicate results when paginating.
* A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
* Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
### [3.13.5: Changes](#3.13.5-changes)

* The `ghe-remove-node` command will display the log file location when running in quiet mode.
* Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
* The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
### [3.13.5: Known issues](#3.13.5-known-issues)

## Enterprise Server 3.13.4

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.4](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.4/download)

September 23, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.4: Security fixes](#3.13.4-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could push a commit with changes to a workflow using a PAT or OAuth app that lacks the appropriate `workflow` scope by pushing a triple-nested tag pointing at the associated commit. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8263](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8263) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** A GitHub App installed in organizations could upgrade some permissions from read to write access without approval from an organization administrator. An attacker would require an account with administrator access to install a malicious GitHub App. GitHub has requested [CVE ID CVE-2024-8810](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8810) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2024-11-07]
### [3.13.4: Bug fixes](#3.13.4-bugs)

* For instances deployed on AWS with IMDSv2 enforced, fallback to private IPs was not successful.
* A config apply run may not have been properly applied due to calls being made to Nomad before it was ready to accept connections. When this occurred, the `Error querying agent info: failed querying self endpoint: Get "http://127.0.0.1:4646/v1/agent/self"` error was written to the `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` file.
* `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
* Replication could be stuck in an loop running `ghe-repl-start` because `GHE_REPL_SSH_RETRY_COUNT` was set to 60 by default for the whole scope of `ghe-repl-start` which will retry config apply (up to 60 times).
* After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
* When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
* Some pre-receive hooks using the `faccessat2` system call, such as those using Alpine Linux as the base, failed unexpectedly.
* Placing Nomad jobs would not allow retries in cases when Nomad wasn't available yet.
* A repeated error message concerning connectivity to port 6002 was emitted to the system logs when Actions was enabled.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
* Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
* In organizations with a large number of repositories, when an administrator used repository properties to target repositories in an organization ruleset, the ruleset index page timed out.
* After a user created a Projects Insights chart with time as the X-axis, the chart became hidden and inaccessible.
* The `CommandPalette` component no longer displays repository information on `404` pages, preventing the leakage of private repository information for users without access.
* A bug introduced in 3.12 which prevented the search input in the global navigation from displaying a dropdown of search suggestions has been fixed. The search input functionality prior to 3.12 has been restored, and users are once again able to see and submit suggested search queries, including scope suggestions.
* Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering and outdated alerts were sometimes published. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?`.
* On an instance with secret scanning enabled, a banner indicated that secret scanning was running on pull request comments and discussions. This feature is not available in this version of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Memory utilization would sometimes exceed levels comparable to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12.
* Some custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering and outdated alerts were sometimes published. You may want to edit and republish your custom patterns. You can manually republish custom patterns with the following command: `ghe-secret-scanning jobs queue custom-patterns republish --custom-pattern-id=?.`
### [3.13.4: Changes](#3.13.4-changes)

* For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
### [3.13.4: Known issues](#3.13.4-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* For customers using Secret Scanning, internal jobs were created and not worked that could contribute to performance issues.
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable.

### [3.13.4: Errata](#3.13.4-errata)

* The [Known issues](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes#3.13.4-known-issues) section previously indicated that `Instance setup in AWS with IMDSv2 enforced fails if no public IP is present` is still an issue. The issue is resolved and is documented in the [Bug fixes](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes#3.13.4-bugs) section. [Updated: 2024-09-30]
## Enterprise Server 3.13.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.3/download)

August 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.13.3: Features](#3.13.3-features)

* Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
### [3.13.3: Security fixes](#3.13.3-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could update the `title`, `assignees`, and `labels` of any issue inside a public repository. This was only exploitable inside a public repository, and private/internal repositories were not affected. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-7711](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-7711) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.13.3: Bug fixes](#3.13.3-bugs)

* During hotpatching and sometimes when applying configuration changes, a configuration run to upgrade the GitHub Actions service was unnecessarily triggered. The GitHub Actions service will only be upgraded in GitHub Enterprise Server feature releases.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
* The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
* Upgrading the Dependency Graph sometimes failed due to outdated data from `go.sum` manifests.
* Restarting the `resolvconf` service would not correctly update the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* The configuration log at `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log` was no longer rotated to `/data/user/config-apply/logs/` after each config apply run. This was because a regular expression failed to match after timestamps were added to the config apply log.
* Empty lines were inserted into the configuration log at `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.
* Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
* The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
* The `ghe-migrations` utility for visualizing migrations did not work due to a regression. Administrators can now run `ghe-migrations` to view the progress and status of `github` migrations, or run `ghe-migrations --all` to view progress on all services.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
* Audit log data migration failed on instances using a legacy Elasticsearch data directory.
* When clicking the help link under the Authentication header in enterprise-manage, the user would be redirected to `/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories` instead of `/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-identity-and-access-management`.
* During support bundle generation or when running `ghe-diagnostics`, filesystem usage for the Elasticsearch data directory was not be included.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
* Site administrators could not switch maintenance mode directly from "scheduled" to "on," or vice versa.
* Some users were unable to delete project views.
* On the repository settings page for GitHub Pages, users saw an option to upgrade to GitHub Enterprise to use GitHub Pages with private visibility.
* When importing using `ghe-migrator`, team URLs containing dots were imported as-is, leading to 404s when attempting to view the imported teams. Dots in imported team URLs are now escaped to dashes.
* In the file tree on the "Files changed" tab of a pull request, users could not collapse or expand directories.
* Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
* Administrators sometimes saw an error message when visiting the administrative search page.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, images served from a subdomain or external source did not render correctly in issues opened in the Projects side panel.
* Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
* The wrong help link was displayed when push protection blocked a secret from the CLI.
* Embedded images in wiki pages were broken.
* For repositories with issues disabled, issue links were redirected to pull requests.
* In custom pre-receive hooks, the paths stored in environment variables that allow for newly pushed objects to be in a quarantine directory could be incorrectly interpreted as relative to a worktree instead of the Git directory, causing certain commands to fail to read from the repository. The variables now use absolute paths.
* A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
* Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
* When enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization, active committers in other organizations were not accounted for.
* Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-09-27]
### [3.13.3: Changes](#3.13.3-changes)

* Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
* When running `ghe-support-bundle`, the support bundle includes the Elasticsearch config.
* In the site admin dashboard, administrators have more granular options for the maximum object size in repositories.
* Users can set their styling preference for link underlines in the web interface, on their "Accessibility" settings page.
* Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
### [3.13.3: Known issues](#3.13.3-known-issues)

* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* `TokenScanningServiceMetricsApiError` errors may appear after the upgrade.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Memory utilization may increase after the upgrade. During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient memory allocations for internal components.
* Running a `config apply` as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* Including `../` when editing a file name does not move the file up a directory level.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* The global search bar does not have suggestions enabled due to the redesigned navigation and pending new search experience.
* When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
* Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
* Instance setup in AWS with IMDSv2 enforced fails if no public IP is present.
* On boot, the `resolvconf` service may fail to start because the `/run/resolvconf` directory does not exist when the service attempts to `touch` a file there, with the error:

  ```
  /bin/touch: cannot touch '/run/resolvconf/postponed-update': No such file or directory

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue with the following commands — this change will persist on reboots, but not upgrades:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak \
  '/\[Service\]/a ExecStartPre\=\/bin\/mkdir \-p \/run\/resolvconf' \
  /etc/systemd/system/resolvconf.service.d/local.conf

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start resolvconf

  ```

  [Updated: 2024-08-26]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

### [3.13.3: Errata](#3.13.3-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.3 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
  The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.13.2](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes#3.13.2-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]
## Enterprise Server 3.13.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.2/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.13.1**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

### [3.13.2: Security fixes](#3.13.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5566](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5566) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the name of a private repository on the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance when the private repository has a deploy key associated to it. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6395](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6395) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **LOW:** Instance administrators could see fine-grained personal access tokens in plaintext in the babeld and gitauth logs.
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to secret scanning alert data because the [REST API secret scanning endpoint](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/rest/secret-scanning/secret-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28) did not properly verify whether the user account has the business owner role. Only organization members can exploit this vulnerability, requiring a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` or `security_events` scopes, limiting exposure to internal actors. Exploitation also required secret scanning to be enabled on user-owned repositories. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-10824](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-10824) for this vulnerability. [Updated: 2024-11-07]
* An attacker could access previously executed private required workflows by changing the repository visibility from private to public. This occurred despite the repositories with the required workflows remaining private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.13.2: Bug fixes](#3.13.2-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command could be run on instance configurations other than high-availability clusters, resulting in an incorrect or incomplete status.
* The threshold set by `server_rejoin_age_max` for single-node GHES deployments was too low.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In a high availablity configuration, running `ghe-repl-node` multiple times from a node that didnt have replication running had the potential to overwrite the configuration on the primary node.
* Configuration history is only generated for instances in a cluster, high availability (HA) cluster, or standalone HA configuration. The current node must be a primary or replica node with replication running.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* When analyzing a repository with code scanning, the extractor logs only contained warnings and errors for some languages.
* The `GitHub Desktop` option in the `Open with...` edit menu was not shown unless `github.dev` was also enabled.
* When transferring a repository, the required properties for one organization continued to be displayed even after a user chose a different owner.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* When a user used the REST API endpoints that returned secret scanning alerts at the repository or organization level with non-cursor-based pagination (for example, without `before` or `after` query parameters), the REST API endpoints for secret scanning returned incorrect `Link` headers.
* On certain branch names, the branch info bar was causing frozen string errors.
* On instances with SAML authentication configured, users were unable to sign out and became stuck in an infinite SAML SSO loop.
* On instances with SCIM enabled, the administrator was unable to view users without an external identity record (for example, because they were provisioned before SCIM was enabled on the instance) in stafftools.
* On instances enrolled in the SCIM private beta, built-in authentication users can be added to organizations and teams. Organization owners will no longer see the misleading message that the organization membership is managed by the SAML identity provider when updating organization memberships.
* Enterprise owners managed by an identity provider were asked to authenticate within GitHub when performing privileged actions.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* Some users would encounter an error when navigating to their personal security settings page at `https://HOSTNAME/settings/security`.
* The `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` could not initialize in some cases, resulting in an exception when handling the error.
* In the sidebar menu that is displayed when a user clicks their profile picture, users who are not enterprise owners saw an "Enterprise settings" option, linking to the main page of an enterprise. This option is now labeled "Your enterprise".
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* The video player did not load a video that was uploaded to an issue.
* The warning message `irb: warn: cant alias delete from irb_delete` would appear during Support Bundle creation and upload.
* When including a `.gitignore` or `README.md` file on repository creation failed due to a ruleset or pre-receive hook, no error message displayed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, requests to the `/enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/advanced-security` REST API endpoint could fail due to timeout.
* The global enterprise overview page contained a "Give feedback" link that was only intended for GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, commits made by users who do not belong to an organization were not counted.
* Due to a regression, adding `../` when editing a files name did not result in the file being moved up a directory level.
* When servers responded with unsupported characters, webhook deliveries were not displayed in the UI.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, contributions were not tracked on public repositories.
* The "Adjust configuration" step failed when enabling code scanning with default setup on self-hosted Windows runners.
* Migration of the `issue_edits` table caused intermittent failures during the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.13, resulting in the error message `ActiveRecord::ConcurrentMigrationError: Failed to release advisory lock.` [Updated: 2024-08-14]
### [3.13.2: Changes](#3.13.2-changes)

* In a high availability configuration, users can only run `ghe-config-apply` or `ghe-cluster-config-apply` on a replica node if replication is already running (from `ghe-repl-start`). If replication isnt running on the node, the user will be instructed to start replication.
* Configuration history has been extended. When `ghe-config-apply`, `ghe-cluster-config-apply`, or `ghe-config-archive` is run: `secrets.conf` is captured, a sha256sum for each of the current configuration files is included, the existing patch that is generated includes `secrets.conf`, and an additional sanitized patch that excludes `secrets.conf` is also generated.
* The timeout for requests made to the REST API endpoints for secret scanning has been extended.
* A more specific error message is shown when a non-provisioned user tried to sign in to an instance with SCIM enabled.
* A more specific error message is shown when a deprovisioned user attempts signing into an instance with SCIM enabled.
* In the audit logs, administrators can see more context for failed user authentication attempts using LDAP.
* The system logs provide more context for authentication failures related to multi-factor authentication.
* When using the `ghe-webhook-logs` utility, webhook delivery logs can be filtered by event and action. Users can use `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues` to filter by event, or `ghe-webhook-logs --event issues.opened` to filter by event and action.
* To avoid excessive log volume and associated disk pressure, requests for `GetCacheKey` are no longer logged. Previously, the high frequency of these requests caused significant log accumulation.
### [3.13.2: Known issues](#3.13.2-known-issues)

* When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some data will appear. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* `TokenScanningServiceMetricsApiError` errors may appear after the upgrade.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Memory utilization may increase after the upgrade. During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient memory allocations for internal components.
* Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
* Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-08-02]
* Images embedded in wiki pages may stop rendering shortly after being published. [Updated: 2024-10-16]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

## Enterprise Server 3.13.0

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.0](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.13.0/download)

June 18, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.13.9) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.15/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

An upgrade to Elasticsearch in version 3.13 may affect performance on your instance. See [Preparing for the Elasticsearch upgrade in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/preparing-for-the-elasticsearch-upgrade).

For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server).

### [3.13.0: Features](#3.13.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + The root navigational experience for enterprise accounts lands all users on an "Enterprise Overview". From this page, enterprise owners can create a README for their enterprise, which will be visible internally to all enterprise members. The "Organization" page still exists and can be accessed from the left sidebar of the enterprise account.
  + To improve the pre-flight checks experience, all pre-flight checks run even if one check fails. A consolidated report of the results is shown in the UI.
  + The editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated in the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API.
  + People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
  + As part of the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13, Elasticsearch (ES) is upgraded from version 5.6.16 to 8.7.0. Upgrading platform components improves performance and security posture. For important upgrade considerations, see [Preparing for the Elasticsearch upgrade in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/preparing-for-the-elasticsearch-upgrade).
  + To improve existing tooling for license handling, the `ghe-license` script handles all operations regarding the active license. Commands can be performed on new licenses without importing them first. The script allows direct application of the license without a full configuration run and avoids restarting the instance to reduce downtime. See [Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-license).

    Administrators can upload the license to their instance using multiple interfaces, including the Management Console, Manage GHES API, CLI, or SSH. See [Uploading a new license to GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/uploading-a-new-license-to-github-enterprise-server).
* #### [Audit logs](#audit-logs)

  + Enterprise and organization audit log events include the applicable SAML and SCIM identity data associated with the user. This data provides increased visibility into the identity of the user and enables logs from multiple systems to quickly and easily be linked using a common corporate identity. The SAML identity information displays in the `external_identity_nameid` field and the SCIM identity data displays in the `external_identity_username` field within the audit log payloads. For more information, see [Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization).
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.314.1. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.314.1). If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release.
  + To ensure Actions runners are truly ephemeral and more secure, execution timeouts on self-hosted jobs are limited to 5 days. If a job reaches this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete. For more information, see [About self-hosted runners](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits).
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Users can use repository properties to add meaningful metadata to repositories that simplifies repository classification, enhances discoverability, and seamlessly integrates with rulesets. For more information, see [Managing custom properties for repositories in your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
  + Users can browse and view code in a revamped experience for GitHub repositories, providing a tree pane for browsing files, fuzzy search for files, sticky code headers, and more.
  + Users can migrate existing tag protection rules into repository rules. For more information, see [Configuring tag protection rules](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-tag-protection-rules#importing-tag-protection-rules-to-repository-rulesets).
* #### [Projects](#projects)

  + Users can post status updates on their projects to share the current status, start date, and target date of the project itself. For more information, see [Sharing project updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/sharing-project-updates).
  + Users can migrate their projects (classic) to the new Projects experience. For more information, see [Migrating from projects (classic)](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/migrating-from-projects-classic).
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Rebase commits are now created using the merge-ort strategy.
* #### [Secret scanning](#secret-scanning)

  + In the secret scanning list view, users can apply a filter to display alerts that are the result of having bypassed push protection. For more information, see [Managing alerts from secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning).
  + To increase coverage of secret scanning across an instance, users can enable secret scanning in repositories owned by their personal account. Enterprise owners can disable this feature, or automatically enable it for all new user-owned repositories, in the enterprise settings. See [Managing GitHub Advanced Security features for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/managing-github-advanced-security-features-for-your-enterprise).
* #### [Code scanning](#code-scanning)

  + Users can enable code scanning on repositories even if they don’t contain any code written in the [languages currently supported by CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/). Default setup will automatically trigger the first scan when a supported language is detected on the default branch. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + Users can use CodeQL threat model settings for Java to adapt CodeQL's code scanning analysis to detect the most relevant security vulnerabilities in their code. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Customizing your advanced setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning).
  + The CodeQL action for code scanning analysis uses version 2.16.5 of the CodeQL CLI by default, an upgrade from 2.15.5 compared to the previous GitHub Enterprise Server feature release. For a detailed list of changes included in each version, see the [CodeQL change logs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/).
    Significant changes include:

    - Support for Swift 5.9.2, C# 12 / .NET 8, and Go 1.22.
    - Installation of Python dependencies is disabled for all Python scans by default. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-07-12-code-scanning-with-codeql-no-longer-installs-python-dependencies-automatically-for-new-users/).
    - A new `python_executable_name` option for the Python extractor. This allows you to select a non-default Python executable installed on the system running the scan (such as `py.exe` on Windows machines). See the [changelog in the CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.16.3/#new-features).
    - A fix for [CVE-2024-25129](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/security/advisories/GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph), a low-severity data exfiltration vulnerability that could be triggered by processing untrusted databases or CodeQL packs.
    - The code scanning UI now includes partially extracted files. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-23-codeql-2-16-python-dependency-installation-disabled-new-queries-and-bug-fixes/#:~:text=The%20measure%20of,the%20near%20future.).
    - 2 new C/C++ queries: `cpp/use-of-unique-pointer-after-lifetime-ends` and `cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf`
    - 6 new Java queries: `java/insecure-randomness` , `java/exec-tainted-environment` , `java/android/sensitive-text`, `java/android/sensitive-notification`, `java/android/insecure-local-authentication`, and `java/android/insecure-local-key-gen`
    - 2 new Swift queries: `swift/weak-password-hashing` and `swift/unsafe-unpacking`
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + On the security overview dashboard, users can find detailed insights for the security alerts in an organization or enterprise, including trending data that tracks alert counts and activity over time and snapshot data that reflects the current state of the security landscape. Alerts are displayed for both GitHub's security features and third-party tools. Filters are available for the type and visibility of alerts, date range, repository custom properties, and more. The overview dashboard is in public beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Viewing security insights](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights).
  + Users can view trending data for the enablement of security features in an organization. In security overview for an organization, the "Enablement trends" view shows historical data for the activation of security features including Dependabot updates, code scanning alerts, and secret scanning alerts. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. For more information, see [Assessing adoption of code security features](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security#viewing-enablement-trends-for-an-organization-beta).
  + For users who use `devcontainer.json` files to define development containers for repositories, Dependabot version updates can keep "features" defined for the dev container up to date. Once configured in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot will open pull requests on a specified schedule to update the listed features to the latest version. Dependabot security updates for dev containers are not currently supported. For more information, see [About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#dev-containers).
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + For enterprises or organizations that use an SSH certificate authority (CA) to provide SSH certificates to members, to protect against a security risk involving user renames, new SSH CAs that are uploaded to a GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13 instance can only be used to sign certificates that are set to expire. For new CAs, you must use the `-V` parameter with `ssh-keygen` to generate a certificate with a `valid-after` claim.

    The `valid-after` claim allows GitHub to validate that the user named in the SSH certificate hasn't been renamed since the certificate was signed. CAs uploaded prior to version 3.13 are exempt from this requirement and can be used to sign certificates that do not expire. However, when you've ensured that your certificate signing process uses the `-V` flag, GitHub encourages you to upgrade existing certificates to enforce the expiration requirement. For more information, see [Managing your organization's SSH certificate authorities](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority) or [Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority).
### [3.13.0: Changes](#3.13.0-changes)

* TCP port 9103 is opened for future administrative features related to support for Prometheus scraping. The port has been open since GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12, but this change wasn't communicated at the time release notes for version 3.12 were first published.
* **Upcoming change:** In version 3.14 and later of GitHub Enterprise Server, for instances with GitHub Actions and GitHub Connect enabled, self-hosted runners that download actions from GitHub.com via GitHub Connect will need to allow access to the following new hosts.

  + `ghcr.io`
  + `*.actions.githubusercontent.com`

  Please update the outbound firewall rules on your self-hosted runners to allow requests to these services. You can make this change on version 3.13, or on a previous version of GitHub Enterprise Server. For a smooth upgrade to version 3.14, we recommend you make changes to your firewall rules now, as failing to do so will result in your runners being unable to download certain actions in version 3.14 and later.
* The "Create a reference" REST API endpoint is restricted from accepting POSTs from users and apps that only have permission to read and write packages. Previously, this endpoint accepted updates to both tags and branches.
* To ensure security updates are applied correctly regardless of your repository's configuration settings, Dependabot uses private registry configurations specified in the `dependabot.yml` file as expected, even if there is a configuration with `target-branch`. Security updates still do not support `target-branch` configuration. For more information, see [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot).
### [3.13.0: Known issues](#3.13.0-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* When enabling log forwarding, specific service logs, including babeld, are duplicated. For more information, see [Log forwarding](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity-in-your-enterprise/log-forwarding#enabling-log-forwarding).
* Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` do not correctly track committers for GitHub Advanced Security billing.
* When log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
* Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
* `TokenScanningServiceMetricsApiError` errors may appear after the upgrade.
* The log entry `irb: warn: can't alias delete from irb_delete` may appear during creation and upload of support bundles.
* The admin stats REST API endpoints may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
* When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
* Running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) might fail with errors if the node being replaced has not first been turned off. If this occurs, turn the node off and repeat the steps.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
* Memory utilization may increase after the upgrade. During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient memory allocations for internal components.
* Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-08-02]
* Images embedded in wiki pages may stop rendering shortly after being published. [Updated: 2024-10-16]
* When operating in a high availability configuration, running `ghe-repl-promote` on a replica node will fail if the original primary cannot be reached by the replica node. This is because the `ghe-repl-promote` script attempts to decommission all Elasticsearch nodes other than the promoted node, however these requests are made to the original primary node which is no longer reachable. The error message written to the terminal will be similar to:

  ```
  Maintenance mode has been enabled for active replica <REPLICA_HOSTNAME>
  {"message": "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact your local GitHub Enterprise site administrator if the problem persists."}
  jq: error (at :3): Cannot index string with string "node"

  ```

  If this occurs, workaround this issue by running the following command — this changes the `ghe-repl-promote` script in place:

  ```
  sudo sed -i.bak -e '/for node_hostname in/i if ! $forced; then' -e '/^  done/a fi' /usr/local/bin/ghe-repl-promote

  ```

  Then re-run the updated `ghe-repl-promote` script.

### [3.13.0: Deprecations](#3.13.0-deprecations)

* As part of sunsetting Subversion compatibility, Subversion support is now disabled by default. Subversion can be re-enabled in the 3.13 release series by setting `app.svnbridge.enabled = true`. In 3.14, subversion support will be permanently removed. For more information, see [Sunsetting Subversion support](https://github.blog/2023-01-20-sunsetting-subversion-support/) on the GitHub blog.
* The Manage GHES API reached feature parity with the Management Console API in GHES 3.12. As a result, we will remove the Management Console API in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15. For information about updating tooling that relies on the Management Console API, see [REST API endpoints for Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console).
* From November 19, 2024, references to v1 and v2 of artifacts actions in GitHub Actions will not resolve. GitHub deprecated v1 and v2 of actions/upload-artifact, actions/download-artifact, and related npm packages on June 30, 2024. You can read more about this deprecation on the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-13-deprecation-notice-v1-and-v2-of-the-artifact-actions/). GitHub Enterprise Server instances configured to use GitHub Connect to download these actions will need to store cached copies locally for workflows to continue working. If your local copy of these actions has been removed, use [GitHub Actions Sync](https://github.com/actions/actions-sync) to manually re-download the actions. [Updated: 2024-18-20]
* The deprecated v1 and v2 versions of artifacts actions will be removed from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15 onwards. Users should update their workflows to use v3 or later versions of artifacts actions. [Updated: 2024-18-20]
### [3.13.0: Errata](#3.13.0-errata)

* The [Deprecations](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes#3.13.0-deprecations) section previously indicated that the Management Console API would be deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14. Instead, the Management Console API will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15. [Updated: 2024-07-08]
