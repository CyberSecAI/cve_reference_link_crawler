Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An untrusted pointer dereference in the `mrb_vm_exec()` function within mruby v3.0.0. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when accessing object properties after calling `mrb_get_args()`, especially in functions like `mrb_ary_shift_m()` or `mrb_as_float()`.  This leads to accessing invalid memory locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference
- Potential reentrancy issues in mruby VM when using `mrb_get_args()`
- Use-after-free vulnerability in array/string manipulation functions (like `Array#rotate`, `Array#rotate!`, `String#byteslice`, and potentially `String#rindex`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault
- Application crash

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted input to mruby that triggers the vulnerable code path within `mrb_vm_exec()`, especially when handling arguments in functions such as `mrb_ary_shift_m()`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a crafted Ruby script to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute mruby code with the vulnerable version (v3.0.0)
- Understanding of mruby internals or ability to craft inputs based on reverse engineering or fuzzing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to argument handling within the mruby virtual machine.
- The issue stems from incorrect management of stack variables after calling `mrb_get_args()` which could lead to use-after-free or access of invalid memory locations.
- The fix involves adjusting the stack and recalculating the `ci` (callinfo) variable after calling `mrb_get_args()` and refactoring how `mrb_as_float` handles generic objects.
- Patches were made in PRs #5619 and #5620.
- The issue was addressed by making changes in the functions like `mrb_ary_shift_m`, ensuring object properties are accessed correctly and also making changes to stack and call information after `mrb_get_args()` is invoked and ensuring `mrb_as_float` only calls `to_f` on Rational or Complex numbers.
