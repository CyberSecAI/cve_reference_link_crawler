Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-8912:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `editusertag.php` file where user-supplied code within the `code` parameter is executed. The `passthru` PHP function is used to execute system commands.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization and the use of a dangerous function (passthru) allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *  **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `admin/editusertag.php` with specific parameters.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated access to the admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server. Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands.

2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `addgroup.php` file doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data in the `group` and `description` parameters before storing it in the database.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject JavaScript code which is later executed in the browsers of other administrators.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `admin/addgroup.php` with malicious payloads in the `group` and `description` fields.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated access to the admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions performed in the context of an administrator's session.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor did not consider XSS within the admin panel as a vulnerability. They also claimed RCE was a feature.
*   The vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed on May 10, 2017, after the vendor refused to address them.
*   The affected software is CMS Made Simple version 2.1.6.
