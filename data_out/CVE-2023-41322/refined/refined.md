- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user with write access to another user can make requests to change the latter's password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control allowing a user with write access to modify another user's password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can take control of the targeted user's account by changing the password.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have write access to another user account. This implies the attacker needs to have a technician role or equivalent permissions.
