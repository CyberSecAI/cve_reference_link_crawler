- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** A successful CSRF attack requires tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to perform a crafted request without their knowledge. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
