Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the `awl_modal_popup_box_shortcode` function of the "Modal Popup Box" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin deserializes data retrieved from the database using `base64_decode` and `unserialize`. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject a malicious PHP object. The plugin was using `unserialize` on base64 decoded data, which was previously serialized using `serialize`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a suitable "POP chain" (a sequence of method calls that can be triggered by a crafted serialized object) exists within the plugin, a theme, or other plugins on the target WordPress site, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Through RCE, an attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, manipulate existing data, or delete arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `awl_modal_popup_box_shortcode` function is used, which is associated with the `[MPBOX]` shortcode in the plugin.
*   **Deserialization of untrusted input:** The plugin uses `unserialize` on base64 decoded data, allowing for the injection of malicious PHP objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. This is because the vulnerability is present within a shortcode function that is only processed during content rendering.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the "Modal Popup Box" plugin up to and including 1.5.2 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.5.3 of the plugin.
*   **Mitigation:** Users are advised to update their plugin to version 1.5.3 or later as soon as possible.
* The fix replaces `base64_encode( serialize( $modal_popup_box_settings ) )` with `json_encode($modal_popup_box_settings)` and `unserialize( base64_decode( get_post_meta( $post_id['id'], 'awl_mpb_settings_' . $post_id['id'], true ) ) )` is replaced with `json_decode(($encodedData), true);`
