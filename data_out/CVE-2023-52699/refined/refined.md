Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52699:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The core issue is that the `sb_bread()` function, which reads a block from the disk, was being called while holding a read lock on `pointers_lock` in the SysV filesystem driver. This created a potential sleep-in-atomic-context scenario, leading to a deadlock or other concurrency problems.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a locking issue in the sysv filesystem driver. Specifically:
    - In Linux 2.5.12, a change introduced a `pointers_lock` rwlock for chain locking which created a "write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock" and a "sb_bread() with write_lock(&pointers_lock)" bug.
    - In Linux 2.6.8, a patch fixed the former deadlock by moving pointers_lock lock to callers. However this patch introduced a "sb_bread() with read_lock(&pointers_lock)" bug.
    - `sb_bread()` can sleep, it should not be called while holding a spinlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Sleep in Atomic Context:** Calling `sb_bread()` while holding a read lock on `pointers_lock` can lead to sleep in an atomic context because `sb_bread()` may sleep.
2.  **Deadlock Potential:** The sequence of locking could lead to deadlocks. There was a "write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock" bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The sleep-in-atomic-context and deadlock scenarios can lead to a denial-of-service condition, where the system becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** This vulnerability can be triggered by a local user, by performing file system operations using the sysv filesystem which exercise the affected code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** A local user with the ability to perform file system operations on a SysV filesystem is needed to trigger the bug.

**Technical Details:**

The patch addresses the issue by modifying the `get_branch`, `get_block` and `find_shared` functions within `fs/sysv/itree.c`.

The changes consist of:

*   Moving the read\_lock(&pointers\_lock) call *after* the `sb_bread()` call in `get_branch()`.
*   Moving the read\_unlock(&pointers\_lock) to *before* the brelse(bh) call.
*   Removing the read\_lock and read\_unlock around the `get_branch()` in `get_block()`.
*   Moving the `get_branch` call before the write lock in `find_shared()`

This ensures that `sb_bread()` is not called while holding `pointers_lock`, preventing the sleep-in-atomic-context issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was reported by syzbot, a fuzzer, indicating that automated testing played a role in its discovery.
*   The fix effectively reverts a previous locking fix while still preventing a deadlock on the `pointers_lock` as `get_branch` is called without the write lock in `find_shared`.

**Summary**

In summary, CVE-2023-52699 arises from improper locking in the sysv filesystem driver where `sb_bread()` which might sleep, was called under spinlock protection. This could lead to a denial of service due to sleep in atomic context or a deadlock. The patch corrects the locking order to avoid this issue.
