The provided content relates to **CVE-2022-48367** as it describes the vulnerability **"Ineffective object state limitation and Unauthenticated Fastly purge"** which is described in the security advisory **IBEXA-SA-2022-004**. Although the CVE ID is not mentioned in the text, the advisory number is, which allows us to assume a connection since it is a known issue.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Ineffective object state limitation:** A flawed update made object state limitations ineffective. This policy was intended to restrict access to content based on specific object state values, but the vulnerability allowed access regardless of the state.
*  **Unauthenticated Fastly purge:** Single PURGE requests to Fastly could be done without authentication, allowing anyone to purge the cache for URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization bypass:** The object state limitation vulnerability resulted in an authorization bypass, granting access to content that should have been restricted.
*   **Unauthenticated cache purge:** The Fastly purge vulnerability allowed unauthenticated users to purge cached content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data exposure:** The ineffective object state limitation could expose content that should have been restricted based on its state. Depending on the frontend design, attackers may or may not need to know the content URL.
*   **Cache manipulation/denial of service:** The unauthenticated Fastly purge could allow an attacker to arbitrarily purge the cache, potentially leading to denial of service by forcing the application to re-render resources, or cache manipulation by purging specific URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Object state limitation:** An attacker could potentially access restricted content by exploiting the ineffective object state limitation, by requesting the URL of the content.
*   **Fastly purge:** An attacker could send unauthenticated PURGE requests to Fastly to purge cached content, by sending a PURGE request for a valid URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Object state limitation:** The attacker needs to have access to the system, or knowledge of the URLs of the content to be accessed.
*   **Fastly purge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Fastly service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the object state limitation issue was introduced in releases made since February 16th 2022.
*   The advisory is distributed via Composer, and provides the version numbers which resolve the vulnerability.
*   The advisory was published on 28/04/2022.
* The advisory states that if object state limitations are used, the first vulnerability is critical and to apply the fix ASAP. The advisory also recommends to apply the fix if Fastly is being used.
