- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that they should not be authorized to do, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of data, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly calling the vulnerable function without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
