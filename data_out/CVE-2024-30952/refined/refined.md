{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PESCMS-TEAM v2.3.6 application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores user-supplied input without sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when user-controlled input is submitted through the Team Setting form, specifically through the domain, siteTitle, upload_img, upload_file, max_upload_size, mail[account], mail[passwd], mail[port] and mail[address] input fields. The attacker needs to be logged into the application to access the vulnerable form and inject the malicious payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the PESCMS-TEAM application with permissions to modify the Team Settings."
