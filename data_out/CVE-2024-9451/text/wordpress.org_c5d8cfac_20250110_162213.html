## Description

Embed a PDF from the Media Library or elsewhere via oEmbed or as a block into an `iframe` tag. The URL only has to be world reachable link. Chrome uses Google Doc Viewer as Chrome seems to automatically rendered embedded JS in PDFs automatically. Uses Google Doc Viewer with mobile.

Inspired by [Embed PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dirtysuds-embed-pdf/) and [RV Embed PDF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rv-embed-pdf/).

Many thanks to [Alex Kirk](https://github.com/akirk) for making Embed PDF Viewer compatible with the new block editor.

Development on [GitHub](https://github.com/afragen/embed-pdf-viewer). Pull requests are welcome against the `develop` branch.

### Known Issues

Occasionally Google Doc Viewer will not correctly load the PDF. Reloading the page should correct the issue, though this may need to be done several times.

Works great on web but when I try to access the website via mobile browser, the pdf has no preview available. BTW, I’m using Wordpress 6.4.3.
Thank you for your effort with this PDF plugin it is a big help and easy to use.

Having tried with a few other PDF embed viewers, this was the one that didn’t add a watermark (EmbedPress), require some sort of paid upgrade (3d flipbook), add an unnecessary ‘Download” button (wordpress inbuilt viewer), or involve technical skills using the shortcode feature (PDF Viewer and PDF.js Viewer).
Really glad to have found it, and thanks to those who developed it!
