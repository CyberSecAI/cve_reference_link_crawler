- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Power Stats plugin versions 2.2.3 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, leading to unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user (with necessary privileges) to interact with a malicious link or form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
