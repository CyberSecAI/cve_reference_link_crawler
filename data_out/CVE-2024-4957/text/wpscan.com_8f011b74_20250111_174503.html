## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Frontend Checklist <= 2.3.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to frontend-checklist admin settings to create a new checklist (options-general.php?page=frontend-checklist&action=new)
2. In the creation page, set the name field to `<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Save the changes and go to listing page to see the XSS (options-general.php?page=frontend-checklist)

### Affects Plugins
