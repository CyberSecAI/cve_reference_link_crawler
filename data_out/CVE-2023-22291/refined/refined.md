### Summary
The provided content describes a vulnerability, CVE-2023-22291, affecting multiple JustSystems products. This vulnerability is a "Free of Memory not on the Heap" issue found in the Frame stream parser of the Ichitaro word processor.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability occurs because a stack buffer is being freed as if it was heap memory. This happens when processing the "Frame" stream of a specially crafted .JTD document during a second pass of parsing operations.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **CWE-590: Free of Memory not on the Heap:** The core weakness is the attempt to `free()` memory that was allocated on the stack instead of on the heap. Specifically, a `object_metadata` is created, which uses stack allocated memory as a buffer. If the size read from the stream is larger than the existing buffer, the application attempts to free it. This leads to a crash because the memory was never allocated on the heap.

### Impact of exploitation
- Memory corruption
- Denial-of-service (DoS)

### Attack vectors
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted .JTD document.
- An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .JTD document to the victim's vulnerable software.
- No special privileges are needed. User interaction (opening the crafted document) is required.
