- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in the `puppetlabs-mysql` module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The module is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system. This could lead to privilege escalation, data breach, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited if a malicious actor is able to provide unsanitized input to the `puppetlabs-mysql` module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to provide unsanitized input to the module, which typically requires elevated privileges within the Puppet environment. This condition is described as "rare in most deployments".
