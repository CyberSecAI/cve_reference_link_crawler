[SECURITY MAIN](/security) > CVE 2022-3276

## CVE-2022-3276 - Puppetlabs-mysql Command Injection

* ### Posted 2022-10-03
* ### Assessed Risk Level: High
* ### CVSS 3.1 Base Score: [8.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

**Resolved in:**

* Puppetlabs-mysql Module 13.0.0
