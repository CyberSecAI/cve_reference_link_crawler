Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0760:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flood of DNS messages over TCP can cause instability in BIND 9 servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how BIND 9 handles a large volume of TCP-based DNS messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The server becomes unstable and potentially unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a flood of DNS messages over TCP to a vulnerable BIND 9 server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

**Additional details:**
- NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable versions of ISC BIND are affected. Specifically, ONTAP 9 is affected when configured for DNS load balancing.
- The vulnerability is present in ISC BIND versions 9.18.1 through 9.18.27 and 9.19.0 through 9.19.24.
