- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient enforcement of message integrity during data transmission. This allows a potential attacker to manipulate data in transit.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS) and a loss of confidentiality and integrity of the controllers. This could result in disruption of industrial operations, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and manipulation of controller behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is the primary attack vector. An attacker would need to position themselves on the network path between the PLC and other communicating devices to intercept and manipulate transmitted messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the PLC and other systems (i.e. a network positioned MitM attack), but does not require any prior authentication or user interaction to exploit. The vulnerability requires a High Access Complexity.
