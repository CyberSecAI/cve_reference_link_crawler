## Description

Machine Automation Controller NJ/NX series provided by OMRON Corporation contain a path traversal vulnerability ([CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html), [CVE-2024-27121](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27121)).

## Impact

An arbitrary file in the affected product may be accessed or arbitrary code may be executed by processing a specially crafted request sent from a remote attacker with an administrative privilege.

## Solution

The developer states that the updates that contain a fix for this vulnerability are scheduled to be released in April 2024.

**Apply the workarounds**

The developer recommends that users apply the following workarounds to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.

* Use "Secure Communication Function" which is implemented in the following products/versions
  + NJ series, NX102, NX1P2 CPU Unit Ver.1.49 and later
  + NX701 CPU Unit Ver.1.29 and later
  + NX502 CPU Unit Ver.1.60 and later
  + NX-EIP201 Ver.1.00 and later
* Restrict access from the untrusted devices and only allow limited network accesses
* Isolate from IT network by placing firewall (block the unused communication ports, restrict communication hosts, etc.)
* Use Virtual Private Network (VPN)

For more information, refer to the information provided by the developer.
