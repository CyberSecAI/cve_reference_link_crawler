# Fake WS server installation permits full takeover

## Description

[*Part of the Cure53 security audit of Home Assistant.*](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/)

Whilst auditing the frontend code to identify hidden parameters, Cure53 detected `auth_callback=1`, which is leveraged by the WebSocket authentication logic in tandem with the state parameter. The `state` parameter contains the `hassUrl`, which is subsequently utilized to establish a WebSocket connection. This behavior permits an attacker to create a malicious Home Assistant link with a modified state parameter that forces the frontend to connect to an alternative WebSocket backend. Henceforth, the attacker can spoof any WebSocket responses and trigger XSS. Since the XSS is executed on the actual Home Assistant frontend domain, it can connect to the real Home Assistant backend, which essentially represents a comprehensive takeover scenario.

Permitting the site to be *iframed* by other origins, as discussed in [this advisory](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw), renders this exploit substantially covert since a malicious website can obfuscate the compromise strategy in the background. However, even without this, the attacker can still send the `auth_callback` link directly to the victim user.

To mitigate this issue, Cure53 advises modifying the WebSocket code’s authentication flow. An optimal implementation in this regard would not trust the `hassUrl` passed in by a GET parameter.

Cure53 must stipulate the significant time required of the Cure53 consultants to identify an XSS vector, despite holding full control over the WebSocket responses. In many areas, data from the WebSocket was properly sanitized, which hinders post-exploitation. The audit team eventually detected the `js_url` for custom panels, though generally, the frontend exhibited reasonable security hardening.

# Lack of XFO header allows clickjacking

Critical

[frenck](/frenck)
published
GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw
Oct 19, 2023

## Package

Home Assistant Core

## Affected versions

< 2023.9.0

## Patched versions

2023.9.0

## Description

[*Part of the Cure53 security audit of Home Assistant.*](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/)

The audit team noted that the Home Assistant server does not set any HTTP security headers, including the `X-Frame-Options` header, which specifies whether the web page is allowed to be framed. The omission of this and correlating headers facilitates covert clickjacking attacks and alternative exploit opportunities, such as the vector described in [this security advisory](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-cr83-q7r2-7f5q).

This fault incurs major risk, considering the ability to trick users into installing an external and malicious add-on with minimal user interaction, which would enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Home Assistant application.

To mitigate this issue, Cure53 strongly suggests setting the XFO header to prevent clickjacking and other attack strategies when a web page is framable. For optimal configuration, the developer team should set the header’s value to either SAMEORIGIN or DENY.
