- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions in Intel® Arc™ RGB Controller software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software has insecure default permissions which could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user could achieve escalation of privilege via local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
