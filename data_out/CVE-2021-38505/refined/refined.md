The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38505.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Firefox (prior to versions 94 and ESR 91.3) did not use specific clipboard formats to prevent copied data from being recorded in Windows 10's Cloud Clipboard and Clipboard History features.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Failure to utilize specific clipboard formats designed to prevent sensitive data from being stored in Cloud Clipboard and Clipboard History on Windows 10.
- Exposing potentially sensitive information to unexpected locations (Cloud/History) without explicit user knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive data, such as passwords, could be recorded in the user's Microsoft account through the Cloud Clipboard feature if it is enabled.
- The data could be available on other computers in certain scenarios, creating a data leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Copying data through the "Copy" button in `about:logins` or using Ctrl+C in Private Browsing.
- A user copying sensitive information in Firefox, which would then be saved to the Cloud Clipboard if enabled on Windows 10.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be in a specific position. The vulnerability is triggered by a user's actions (copying data) within the Firefox browser.
- The attacker needs to have access to the user's Microsoft account, where the Cloud Clipboard data is stored.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed by adding three specific clipboard formats that prevent sensitive data from being recorded by the Windows Cloud Clipboard and history features.
- The fix prevents data copied from Private Browsing or sensitive fields from being saved to clipboard history.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled.
- The fix was included in Firefox 94 and ESR 91.3 and later versions.
- The bug was classified as "sec-high" and a "privacy" issue.
