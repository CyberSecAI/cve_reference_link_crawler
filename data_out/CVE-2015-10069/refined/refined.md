Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of string formatting (`%s`) to construct SQL queries in the `get_card` and `block_card` functions within the `machine.py` file. This practice makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The code directly embeds user-provided data (credit card number and card ID) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to unauthorized database access, data modification, or other malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as credit card numbers, user details, and account balances.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious actors could modify data, potentially altering account balances, transferring funds, or blocking legitimate user accounts.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers might be able to disrupt the service by injecting queries that consume excessive resources or corrupt the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In certain scenarios, successful SQL injection could lead to complete control over the database server and potentially other parts of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Input Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the `cc_number` parameter in the `get_card` function or the `id` within the `card` session variable to inject SQL code. This could be achieved by crafting malicious input containing SQL keywords and commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and provide input to the functions that use the vulnerable SQL query construction, such as `get_card` and `block_card`. The attacker could be an external user providing a malicious `cc_number` value, or someone who can manipulate the session state to control the value of `card['id']`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit log indicates an attempt to fix the SQL injection vulnerability. The commit message is "Prevent sql injection, refresh db." This indicates the developer was aware of this security issue and attempted to address it by replacing string formatting (`%s`) with parameterized queries (`?`). The code diff confirms that this is indeed what was done.
- It should also be noted that `machine.db` was modified as well in the commit, but no details are given about the changes made to the binary file.
- The vulnerability is located in the `machine.py` file within the "cash-machine" repository.
