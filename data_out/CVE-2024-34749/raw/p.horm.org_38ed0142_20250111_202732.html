	<img align="left" src="images/xml.gif" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 40px;" />
	<p>Phormer, unlike most of the other gallery mangers tools that
	require MySQL or any other high-level Databases, uses its own
	<a href="#?" class="abbr" title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</a>
	database files which let us:
	<ul class="level2">
		<li><span>Run Phormer on any server with only a php parser (like apache)!</span></li>
		<li><span>Modify the information offline and/or using any text-editor, even Phormer's own online XML-Editor!</span></li>
		<li><span>Have transportable files, which speeds up import and export!</span></li>
		<li><span>Simple Backup! Just copy the folder of data/ which has all the information of photos, comments, categories and ...</span></li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<br />
	<p>
		Beside, here is a brief list of other helpful features of Phormer:
		<ul class="level2">
			<li><span><b>Easy Web-based Install/Uninstall</b><br />
				To install, just download the package, unzip it to the desired place on your website,
				and then enter admin's password!<br />
				Also since version 3.20, you can easily uninstall Phormer directly from Administration
				Region.
			</span></li>

			<br />
			<li><span><b>Categorize by Date, Categorize by Subject, Categorize by Everything!</b><br />
				Having two separate categorization method will lead to
				handle everything in the most right place! -- You can
				both categorize your shots by Category (e.g. black and
				white, self-portrait, etc.) and, on the other hand, by
				date (which named story), just like the posts of a
				weblog. <br />
				Obviously, a shot can be placed in many Categories and many Stories at
				the same time! <br />
				Even, the Categories/Stories, themselves can be inherited from eachother!<br />
			</span></li>

			<img align="right" src="images/private_categ.gif" style="" />
			<br />
			<li><span><b>Make Anything Private!</b><br />
				Phormer's great privacy allows both private (passworded of each own) and
				unlisted (unseen from the first page) mode for each Categories/Stories.<br />
				This way, any photo which its default Category or Story be private would be
				private, too.<br />
				Umm... with the help of this feature you can have various albums for
				various (possibly private) events, so simply.
			</span></li>

			<br />
			<li><span><b>Fast and Valid Pages</b><br />
				Tableless pages, browser compatible and brief administration area,
				means just clean speed!

				Name and fill information of your shot while its upload
				progress goes (ajaxly) on background!<br />

				task (filling name, date, info) and it goes its own way
				under the desk!<br />
