Phormer, unlike most of the other gallery mangers tools that
require MySQL or any other high-level Databases, uses its own
[XML](#? "eXtensible Markup Language")
database files which let us:

* Run Phormer on any server with only a php parser (like apache)!
* Modify the information offline and/or using any text-editor, even Phormer's own online XML-Editor!
* Have transportable files, which speeds up import and export!
* Simple Backup! Just copy the folder of data/ which has all the information of photos, comments, categories and ...

Beside, here is a brief list of other helpful features of Phormer:

* **Easy Web-based Install/Uninstall**

  To install, just download the package, unzip it to the desired place on your website,
  and then enter admin's password!

  Also since version 3.20, you can easily uninstall Phormer directly from Administration
  Region.

* **Categorize by Date, Categorize by Subject, Categorize by Everything!**

  Having two separate categorization method will lead to
  handle everything in the most right place! -- You can
  both categorize your shots by Category (e.g. black and
  white, self-portrait, etc.) and, on the other hand, by
  date (which named story), just like the posts of a
  weblog.

  Obviously, a shot can be placed in many Categories and many Stories at
  the same time!

  Even, the Categories/Stories, themselves can be inherited from eachother!
![](images/private_categ.gif)

* **Make Anything Private!**

  Phormer's great privacy allows both private (passworded of each own) and
  unlisted (unseen from the first page) mode for each Categories/Stories.

  This way, any photo which its default Category or Story be private would be
  private, too.

  Umm... with the help of this feature you can have various albums for
  various (possibly private) events, so simply.

* **Fast and Valid Pages**

  Tableless pages, browser compatible and brief administration area,
  means just clean speed!

* **Link and Extra HTML Manager**

  Manage the side-bar links of your blogs, visually from
  inside the administration area, so fast and clean!

  Also paste the additional HTML codes of your counter, ad-sense into
  the Preferences area instead of dealing with HTML codes of the index!

* **Two File gathering mods**

  Image files can be acquired either from the PC (by
  Ajaxian upload manager) or from somewhere across the web
  (just enter url!).
![](images/add_photo.gif)

* **Ajax Upload Manager**

  Name and fill information of your shot while its upload
  progress goes (ajaxly) on background!

  It's brilliant! You won't lag by your monitor and glaze
  at the percentages to become filled -- Just do your own
  task (filling name, date, info) and it goes its own way
  under the desk!

  **Since 3.30, you can upload a zip file of many photos inside
  and also grab entire a local folder!**

* **Square thumbs**

  Easy WYSIWYG Part-of-Image Square-Thumb maker tool helps
  you to create the best square thumb from your shots which
  is best-fitted and much more catchy! various sizes of
  whole image can also be generated, beside.
