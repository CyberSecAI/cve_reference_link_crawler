* GPL-3.0 license
> Personal Note (Feb 2024): Phormer has been a pet project back in 2007. It is no longer maintained. However, it should still work, even with PHP 8. ^\_^

# About:

Phormer is featureful a Photo Gallery Manager in PHP (and no MySQL)!

* Homepage: <https://p.horm.org/er>
* Demo: <https://p.horm.org>
* Former Project Home: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/rephormer/> (Since 2007)

# Installation Instructions:

1. Download the latest version of phormer###.zip from <http://p.horm.org/er> (or `/bin` folder here)
2. Unzip the `phormer###.zip` file (~90KB) to the destination folder on your
   server (e.g. `/var/www/photos`). (Hint: type this command: "`unzip phormer###.zip`"
   in the shell).
3. Load that by a web browser (e.g. `http://somewhere/photos`) and fill the
   short form of preferences.

That's all!

Note that the base directory of phormer must be writable by php server, for
the first time installation. Thus, `chmod 777` this base directory (where
`index.php`, `admin.php` & etc are placed) after the unzip, and when installation
completed, turn them back to `711`.

Briefly, after uploading, the following
commands shall be entered:

```
   $ unzip phormer###
   $ chmod 777 .

```

and after installation (getting the "installation completed" message):

```
   $ chmod 711 .

```

# Update Instructions:

1. Remove folder "`files/`" and all files in root of installation directory
   (e.g. `index.php`, `admin.php` and etc.) after that, there should be just 3
   folders of "`data/`", "`images/`" and "`temp/`" there with no files in root
   folder.
   HINT: in correct accessing mode, those 3 folders are owned by PHP and you
   may not delete them.
2. Place all the contents of download phormer (i.e. a folder of "`files/`" and
   some files to be placed at root of installation) there. no conflict should
   occur.
3. Go to administration area (<http://example.com/photos/admin.php>) and work
   fine! All your images would be saved through an update.

That's all!

# FEATURES:

* **Easy webbased setup:** Just copy the files and then enter admin's password!
  Also uninstallation is so easy and can be done from
  inside the Phormer by one click (after confirmation!).
* **Fast and valid pages:** Tableless and human-made XHTML codes for both admin
  and visitors page, leads faster and cleaner pages which
  are tested in common browers! also the image-less and
  comfortable administration region has provided very
  fast and exact navigation whole around!
* **XML databases:** Light, easy to handle/manage/backup/manualModification.
  Doesn't require any sql (mysql, pgsql) account on
  machine, just a php server!
* **Category/Story:** Having two separate categorization method will lead to
  handle everything in the most right place! -- You can
  both categorize your shots by Category (e.g. black and
  white, self-portrait, etc.) and, on the other hand, by
  date (which named story), just like the posts of a
  weblog.
* **Hierarchical Categs:** Each photo can be placed in several categories/stories.
  also the Categories/Stories, themselves can be
  inherited.
* **Improved Privacy:** Leads both private (passworded of each own) and
  unlisted (unseen from the first page) mode for the
  Categories/Stories.
* **Link Manager:** Manage the side-bar links of your blogs, visually from
  inside the administration area, so fast and clean!
* **File gathering mods:** Image files can be acquired either from the PC (by
  Ajaxian upload manager) or from somewhere across the
  web (just enter url!).
* **Ajax Upload Manager:** Name and fill information of your shot while its upload
  progress goes (ajaxly) on background!
* **Square thumbs:** Easy WYSIWYG Part-of-Image Square-Thumb maker tool
  helps you to create the best square thumb from your
  shots which is best-fitted and much more catchy!
  various sizes of whole image can also be generated,
  beside.
* **Editable add-shot:** Edit and regenerate/re-enter everything at everytime,
  even the photo's source file!
* **Advanced Commenting:** Manage them easily. Control visitors to leave comments
  on each photo/story or not.
* **RSS Feed:** Don't Lose RSS-Addicted visitors! index.xml for last
  photo entries will be generated after each photo
  add/del.
* **Various Themes:** You'll never get bored with 10 different styles.
* **Various styles:** 3 different styles for index page: photos, stories,
  jungleBox (where all the shots can be place above each
  other and be highlighted when pointed!). a Random of
  them can also be selected!
* **Rating system:** Save the opinion (rating) of visitors about each single
  photo and sort them in that way!
  Note: on version 2.30 and later, the Rating is moved on
  AJAX system and visitors doesn't need to load the page
  once again!
* **Comment Manager:** Save each Photo/Story's comments separately which can
  be disabled (for each item) in admin's page. also
  catches the date and the IP of each comment. they can
  be browsed totally sorted-by-date by admin and be
  deleted (if needed!) by a single click.
  also, since version 3.10, word verification feature has
  comen to help fighting against spam commenters!
* **Hit Counter:** Counts each shot's view-times, separately!
* **Easy export:** Use each photo in your weblog/website (in proper size)
  by a single code (e.g. something like this line:
  <script src="<http://mywebby.com/?j=290"></script>>) in
  various sizes.
  Also, since version 3.30, export method in PHP is
  available - just put this line in your PHP code:
  include("<http://mywebby.com/?jj=290>");
  Note that in both modes of export, you can set pass a
  size parameter (in range [0..4] to get various sizes)
  like: include("<http://mywebby.com/?jj=290&size=2>");
  in PHP export!
* **Info gatherer (EXIF):** Save the photo info (like focus mode, shutter speed,
  ...), date taken and every other precise data about
  each shot. Since version 3.20, EXIF handling is also
  enabled.
* **I18n:** using unicode (UTF-8) as whole encoding system, has
  provided a reliable support of various languages.

  ~ ~ ~

ALSO, ON VERSION 3.30 AND AFTER:

* Powerful Backup Anytime, each of your essential XML files missed or
  corrupted Due to a server lack of write or synchronous
  problem, Phormer will automatically notify you of that
  and helps you to restore the last saved backup.
  NOTE: always log-out to save a back-up of your files,
  automatically!
* Help Interactive help on every menu feeds you the required
  informations about each item.
* Automatic Update Your PG, by contacting to the homepage of Phormer, will
  notify of that!
* Statistics Online visitors count, today, yesterday & this month
  visitors count.
* Mass Upload Now, you can upload many of your files into a .zip file
  and also add several inside another local directory!
* External CSS Is now supported, just put them into files/externalcss
  and pick them inside the preferences area.
* SlideShow Is available now! both for stories and categories and
  also for recent photos
* New recenting modes! Recently commented and Random photos are also added to
  First page indexing made, which is rebuilt.
