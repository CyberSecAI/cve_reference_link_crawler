Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2798

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `position_location` attribute within the sticky section functionality was not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the `position_location` parameter and stored in the WordPress database. This code will be executed in the user's browser when the affected page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages using the vulnerable plugin settings.
*   When a user visits an injected page, the malicious scripts are executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's widget containers settings. Specifically, by manipulating the `position_location` attribute for the sticky section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they must have an account on the WordPress site with the ability to modify pages or posts.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin up to and including version 1.3.971.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.972.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `position_location` parameter using the `sanitize_text_field` function, and validating it against a list of allowed values (`top`, `bottom`).
* The vulnerability is DOM-Based meaning the injected script executes through the modification of the page's DOM through the vulnerable javascript code.
