- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Profinet-IO (PNIO) stack versions prior to V06.00. These versions do not properly limit internal resource allocation when multiple legitimate diagnostic package requests are sent to the DCE-RPC interface.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) due to insufficient limitation of resource allocation.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The affected device becomes unavailable due to lack of memory caused by the uncontrolled resource allocation.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker with network access to an affected device can exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device. No system privileges or user interaction are needed for successful exploitation.
