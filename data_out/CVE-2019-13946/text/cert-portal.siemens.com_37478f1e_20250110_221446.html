DCE-RPC Packets

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

SUMMARY

Products that include the Siemens PROFINET-IO (PNIO) stack in versions prior V06.00 are potentially
affected by a denial of service vulnerability when multiple legitimate diagnostic package requests are sent
to the DCE-RPC interface.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet
available.

Additionally, Siemens recommends other vendors of PROFINET devices to check if their products have
incorporated a vulnerable version of the Siemens PNIO stack as part of the Siemens Development/Evalu-
ation Kits.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable PROFINET in products, where PROFINET is optional and not used in your environment
• Block incoming DCE-RPC packets (port 34964/udp) from untrusted networks

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1616 and CP 1604 are PCI/PCI-104 cards for high-performance connection of field devices
to Industrial Ethernet with PROFINET.

Development/Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO are used to develop compact or modular PROFINET field
devices.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SIMATIC RF600 Readers are used for the contactless identification of every kind of object, e.g. transport
containers, pallets, production goods, or it can be generally used for recording goods in bulk.

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

SCALANCE W products are wireless communication devices used to connect industrial components, like
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), according to the IEEE
802.11 standard (802.11ac, 802.11a/b/g/h, and/or 802.11n).

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

SIMATIC ET 200 Interface modules for PROFINET IO are used to connect field devices (IO Devices) to
controllers (IO Controller) via PROFINET.

With the SIMATIC IPC Support Package for VxWorks, Siemens offers support for industrial computers
(SIMATIC IPCs) for the VxWorks real-time operating system.

SIMATIC MV400 devices are stationary optical readers, used to reliably capture printed, lasered, drilled,
punched and dotpeen codes on a variety of different surfaces.

PROFINET Driver is a development kit used to develop PROFINET IO controllers.

SIMATIC RF180C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identification
systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet. SIMATIC RF180C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices
(RF185C, RF186C, RF188C).

SIMATIC RF182C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identification
systems to Ethernet/IP. SIMATIC RF182C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices (RF185C,
RF186C, RF188C).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIMATIC RF185C, RF186C/CI, and RF188C/CI are communication modules for direct connection of
SIMATIC identification systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet and OPC UA.

SIMOTION is a scalable high performance hardware and software system for motion control.

With the SINAMICS converter series you can solve drive tasks in the low, medium and DC voltage range.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

The SOFTNET product family includes several software applications for connecting programming devices
to Industrial Ethernet and PROFIBUS.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13946

Profinet-IO (PNIO) stack versions prior V06.00 do not properly limit internal resource allocation when
multiple legitimate diagnostic package requests are sent to the DCE-RPC interface. This could lead to a
denial of service condition due to lack of memory for devices that include a vulnerable version of the
stack.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to an affected device.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the
vulnerability to compromise the availability of the device.
