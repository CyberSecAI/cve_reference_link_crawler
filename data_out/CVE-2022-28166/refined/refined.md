Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the implementation of TLS/SSL server in Brocade SANnav which supports the use of static key ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The use of static key ciphers in TLS/SSL implementations. Static key ciphers are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks because the same key is used for all sessions, which, when compromised, allows decryption of past and future communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks targeting ports 443 and 18082 where the vulnerable service is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ports (443 and 18082) on the Brocade SANnav server. No specific authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
- Brocade SANnav versions prior to v2.2.0.2 and v2.1.1.8.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Brocade SANnav v2.2.0.2 or v2.1.1.8 or later versions.
