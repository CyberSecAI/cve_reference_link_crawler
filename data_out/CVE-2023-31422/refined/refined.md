Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Sensitive information, including authentication credentials, cookies, authorization headers, query parameters, request paths, and other metadata, is being included in Kibana logs when errors occur. This happens when logging is configured to use either the JSON layout or the pattern layout with the `%meta` pattern.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Exposure:** Kibana logs are unintentionally recording sensitive request data due to the way error objects are logged.
- **Insecure Logging Configuration:** Using the JSON layout or the pattern layout with the `%meta` pattern includes request metadata in the logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Compromise:** Attackers who gain access to the logs could extract sensitive information, such as account credentials for `kibana_system`, `kibana-metricbeat`, or Kibana end-users.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Exposed credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to Kibana and potentially the underlying Elasticsearch cluster.
- **Data Breach:** Other sensitive information in the logs may also lead to a broader data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Log Access:** The primary attack vector is unauthorized access to Kibana log files. This can happen if:
    - The attacker gains access to the file system where logs are stored.
    - The attacker has access to a centralized logging system that collects Kibana logs.
    - The attacker has access to the logging and monitoring infrastructure of Elastic Cloud customers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Log Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the Kibana log files.
- **Knowledge of Log Locations:**  The attacker needs to know where the logs are stored, which can vary based on the installation type of Kibana (Archive, Docker, RPM/DEB, ECE, ECK).

**Additional Information:**
- The specific fields in the logs containing credentials are:
    - `error.meta.meta.request.params.headers.authorization`
    - `error.meta.meta.request.options.headers.authorization`
    - `error.cause.meta.meta.request.params.headers.authorization`
    - `error.cause.meta.meta.request.options.headers.authorization`
    - `error.originalError.meta.meta.request.params.headers.authorization`
    - `error.originalError.meta.meta.request.options.headers.authorization`

- The vulnerability is present in Kibana version 8.10.0. It is resolved in version 8.10.1.
- Elastic Cloud customers using Kibana 8.10.0 have been patched.
- Mitigations include rotating compromised credentials, purging data from logs, and using an ingest processor to redact sensitive fields before logging.
