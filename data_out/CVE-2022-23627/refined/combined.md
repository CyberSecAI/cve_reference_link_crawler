### Notice

**Pre-releases are experimental versions that often contain unpatched bugs, work-in-progress features or rewritten implementations. If you don't consider yourself advanced user, please download [latest stable release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest) instead. Pre-release versions are dedicated to users who know how to report bugs, deal with issues and give feedback - no technical support will be given. Check out ASF [release cycle](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Release-cycle) if you'd like to learn more.**

---

### Changelog

Changes since **[V5.2.2.5](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.2.5)**:

* Removed `Statistics` global config property. Added **[`RemoteCommunication`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#remotecommunication)** bot config property in its place that allows switching communication with Steam group and ASF STM listing on per-bot basis. Existing users of `Statistics: false` will be automatically migrated to `RemoteConnection: 0`. If you've disabled automatic config migration through cmd-line switch, you'll need to migrate yourself, as obsolete property will be removed in the next release cycle ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Directly connected with the above, we've added new **[remote communication](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Remote-communication)** wiki section in place of old statistics section, where users can now learn about third-party remote communication included in ASF. We recommend to give it a read if privacy subject is important for you ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Added additional delay logic to `GamesPlayedWhileIdle` if the session was previously forcefully disconnected due to starting a game ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* `MatchActively` setting of **[`TradingPreferences`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#tradingpreferences)** no longer requires `SteamTradeMatcher` to be enabled as well. It's now possible to match cards passively (`SteamTradeMatcher`), actively (`MatchActively`), or both. Previously standalone active matching was not possible ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes ([@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)).
* Updated **[localization](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)** provided by our community ([@JustArchi-ArchiBot](https://github.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot)).
* Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* [**[Deprecation](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Deprecation)**] Features deprecated in the previous release cycle have been removed ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).

### Support

ASF is available for free, this release was made possible thanks to the people that decided to support the project. If you're grateful for what we're doing, please consider a donation. Developing ASF requires massive amount of time and knowledge, especially when it comes to Steam (and its problems). Even $1 is highly appreciated and shows that you care. Thank you!

### Changelog

Changes since **[V5.2.2.4](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.2.4)**:

* **[!]** Fixed inadequate access verification when using proxy commands. Due to security nature of this issue, we recommend an upgrade immediately ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi), [#GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories/GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89)).

Changes since **[V5.2.1.5](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.1.5)**:

* It's now possible to use IPC (ASF-ui) commands and interactive console without a requirement of setting up `SteamOwnerID` ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi) [#2500](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues/2500)).
* Fixed SK2 regression introduced in V5.2.0.0 that broke ASF's ability to mark Steam chat messages as read ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi) [#2483](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues/2483)).
* Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes ([@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)).
* Updated **[localization](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)** provided by our community ([@JustArchi-ArchiBot](https://github.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot)).
* Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* [**[Deprecation](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Deprecation)**] ASF plugins that implement `IBotCommand` interface or use `Bot.HasAccess()`, `Commands.Response()` functionality will need slight code changes in regards to changes done as part [#2501](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2501). We tried our best to keep them working as part of this release - the deprecated functionality will be removed in the next release cycle.

# Inadequate access verification when using proxy commands (< 5.2.2.5, < 5.2.3.2)

Moderate

[JustArchi](/JustArchi)
published
GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89
Feb 8, 2022

## Package

ArchiSteamFarm
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

Between ≥ 5.2.2.2 and < 5.2.2.5, between ≥ 5.2.3.0 and < 5.2.3.2

## Patched versions

≥ 5.2.2.5, ≥ 5.2.3.2

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targetting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances.

A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. Such access is impossible to obtain without prior ASF owner's consent, therefore vastly limiting potential damage that can be done.

While majority of users run ASF in single-user scenario, not being directly affected, those that share access to their bots, or run bots for other people, should consider upgrading ASAP.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Since successful attack requires explicit permission granted, the security threat doesn't apply to people that are the sole owners of all bots that are running as part of ASF process, that is, without having any other (human) users configured as masters, operators or family sharing. It's also a recommended workaround for the problem in case you're unable to upgrade to newer version, that is, ensuring that no other people are configured to access any declared bots, as it removes the attack vector entirely.

While not strictly a workaround, if your users already can access all of the bots (owning master permission), then there is nothing further to exploit either.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

The issue was originally introduced in [#2501](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2501).

The problematic code was fixed in [#2509](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2509).

Originally reported by [@TheRhanderson](https://github.com/TheRhanderson) on our ASF Discord server (not linked here).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Summary of changes in this PR for reviewers:   * Added `IBotCommand2` interface. * `IBotCommand`, `Bot.HasAccess()` and `Commands.Response()` (overload which doesn't accept `EAccess`) is now obsolete. * Added `Bot.GetAccess()`, which returns new `EAccess`, compared to just rewriting `HasAccess()` for new overload, I prefer this one, as user may have different use-case than just validating access, for example different logic depending on access of the caller. * Added `Commands.Response()` overload which accepts `EAccess` from above. * Added `IBotCommand2` interface which accepts `EAccess` and is now aware of `steamID` being `0`. * IPC commands are now calling `Commands.Response()` with `EAccess` of `Owner` and `steamID` of `0`. * Steam commands resolve `EAccess` of user calling it, then use the overload above with `steamID` of the caller. * Adapted all parts that required adapting in regards to the above.   It's expected that old `IBotCommand` plugins before this release **keep working** until obsolete methods are removed in the future release cycle - therefore major bump isn't required just yet. |
