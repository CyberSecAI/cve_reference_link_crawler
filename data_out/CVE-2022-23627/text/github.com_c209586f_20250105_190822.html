| Summary of changes in this PR for reviewers:   * Added `IBotCommand2` interface. * `IBotCommand`, `Bot.HasAccess()` and `Commands.Response()` (overload which doesn't accept `EAccess`) is now obsolete. * Added `Bot.GetAccess()`, which returns new `EAccess`, compared to just rewriting `HasAccess()` for new overload, I prefer this one, as user may have different use-case than just validating access, for example different logic depending on access of the caller. * Added `Commands.Response()` overload which accepts `EAccess` from above. * Added `IBotCommand2` interface which accepts `EAccess` and is now aware of `steamID` being `0`. * IPC commands are now calling `Commands.Response()` with `EAccess` of `Owner` and `steamID` of `0`. * Steam commands resolve `EAccess` of user calling it, then use the overload above with `steamID` of the caller. * Adapted all parts that required adapting in regards to the above.   It's expected that old `IBotCommand` plugins before this release **keep working** until obsolete methods are removed in the future release cycle - therefore major bump isn't required just yet. |
