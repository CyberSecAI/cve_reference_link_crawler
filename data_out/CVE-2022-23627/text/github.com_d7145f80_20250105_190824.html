### Notice

**Pre-releases are experimental versions that often contain unpatched bugs, work-in-progress features or rewritten implementations. If you don't consider yourself advanced user, please download [latest stable release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest) instead. Pre-release versions are dedicated to users who know how to report bugs, deal with issues and give feedback - no technical support will be given. Check out ASF [release cycle](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Release-cycle) if you'd like to learn more.**

### Changelog

Changes since **[V5.2.2.5](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.2.5)**:

* Removed `Statistics` global config property. Added **[`RemoteCommunication`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#remotecommunication)** bot config property in its place that allows switching communication with Steam group and ASF STM listing on per-bot basis. Existing users of `Statistics: false` will be automatically migrated to `RemoteConnection: 0`. If you've disabled automatic config migration through cmd-line switch, you'll need to migrate yourself, as obsolete property will be removed in the next release cycle ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Directly connected with the above, we've added new **[remote communication](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Remote-communication)** wiki section in place of old statistics section, where users can now learn about third-party remote communication included in ASF. We recommend to give it a read if privacy subject is important for you ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Added additional delay logic to `GamesPlayedWhileIdle` if the session was previously forcefully disconnected due to starting a game ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* `MatchActively` setting of **[`TradingPreferences`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#tradingpreferences)** no longer requires `SteamTradeMatcher` to be enabled as well. It's now possible to match cards passively (`SteamTradeMatcher`), actively (`MatchActively`), or both. Previously standalone active matching was not possible ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes ([@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)).
* Updated **[localization](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)** provided by our community ([@JustArchi-ArchiBot](https://github.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot)).
* Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* [**[Deprecation](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Deprecation)**] Features deprecated in the previous release cycle have been removed ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).

### Support

ASF is available for free, this release was made possible thanks to the people that decided to support the project. If you're grateful for what we're doing, please consider a donation. Developing ASF requires massive amount of time and knowledge, especially when it comes to Steam (and its problems). Even $1 is highly appreciated and shows that you care. Thank you!
