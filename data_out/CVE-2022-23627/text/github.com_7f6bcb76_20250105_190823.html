### Changelog

Changes since **[V5.2.2.4](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.2.4)**:

* **[!]** Fixed inadequate access verification when using proxy commands. Due to security nature of this issue, we recommend an upgrade immediately ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi), [#GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories/GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89)).

Changes since **[V5.2.1.5](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.1.5)**:

* It's now possible to use IPC (ASF-ui) commands and interactive console without a requirement of setting up `SteamOwnerID` ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi) [#2500](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues/2500)).
* Fixed SK2 regression introduced in V5.2.0.0 that broke ASF's ability to mark Steam chat messages as read ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi) [#2483](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues/2483)).
* Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes ([@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)).
* Updated **[localization](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)** provided by our community ([@JustArchi-ArchiBot](https://github.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot)).
* Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes ([@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)).
* [**[Deprecation](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Deprecation)**] ASF plugins that implement `IBotCommand` interface or use `Bot.HasAccess()`, `Commands.Response()` functionality will need slight code changes in regards to changes done as part [#2501](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2501). We tried our best to keep them working as part of this release - the deprecated functionality will be removed in the next release cycle.

### Support

ASF is available for free, this release was made possible thanks to the people that decided to support the project. If you're grateful for what we're doing, please consider a donation. Developing ASF requires massive amount of time and knowledge, especially when it comes to Steam (and its problems). Even $1 is highly appreciated and shows that you care. Thank you!
