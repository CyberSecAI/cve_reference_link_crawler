- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL that is then executed within the context of the application after authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to privilege escalation and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload. An authenticated user opens the crafted URL and hovers over a specific element (refresh image), triggering the execution of the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but the victim needs to be authenticated and needs to open the malicious url.
