# Security Bulletin: IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) is vulnerable to denial of service (CVE-2022-22423)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Insufficient input validation in IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) may affect Hardware Security Module (HSM) availability. An affected IBM 4767 or IBM 4769 HSM may be forced into a check-stop condition by specially-crafted requests from HSM users. Recovery from a check-stop condition requires manual intervention.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2022-22423](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22423)

## Affected Products and Versions

| **Affected Product(s)** | **Platform(s)** | **Version(s)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CCA 5.x MTM for 4767 | IBM AIX, IBM i, Linux (Intel x86 platforms) | 5.0.0 - 5.7.11 |
| CCA 7.x MTM for 4769 | IBM AIX, IBM i, IBM PowerLinux, Linux (Intel x86 platforms) | 7.0.0 - 7.3.43 |

## Remediation/Fixes

**IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now by upgrading:**

| **Product(s)** | **Fixed Version(s)** |
| --- | --- |
| CCA 5.x MTM for 4767 | 5.7.12 or later |
| CCA 7.x MTM for 4769 | 7.3.44 or later |

**Platform-specific upgrade information:**

**IBM AIX**

For CCA 5.x for 4767, please download version 5.7.12 or later from the [CCA Software Download Page](https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc4/software "CCA Software Download Page").

For CCA 7.x for 4769, please download version 7.3.44 or later from the [CCA Software Download Page](https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc4/software "CCA Software Download Page").

**IBM i**

The vulnerability can be fixed by applying a PTF to IBM i. Releases 7.5, 7.4, 7.3, and 7.2 of IBM i will be fixed.Â  Each PTF bundles updates to CCA 5.x MTM for 4767 and CCA 7.x MTM for 4769, bringing their respective firmware levels to 5.7.12 and 7.3.44 or later, respectively.

The PTF numbers containing the fix for this vulnerability are in the following table:

| **IBM i release** | **5733-CY3 IBM Cryptographic Device Manager for i PTF Number** |
| --- | --- |
| 7.5 | [SI79698](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ptf/SI79698 "SI79698") |
| 7.4 | [SI79699](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ptf/SI79699 "SI79699") |
