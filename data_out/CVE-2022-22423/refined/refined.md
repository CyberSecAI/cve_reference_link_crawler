- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation which allows for a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An affected IBM 4767 or IBM 4769 HSM may be forced into a check-stop condition, requiring manual intervention for recovery. This leads to Hardware Security Module (HSM) availability issues.
- **Attack vectors:** Specially-crafted requests from HSM users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be a user of the HSM and able to send specially crafted requests to the HSM.
