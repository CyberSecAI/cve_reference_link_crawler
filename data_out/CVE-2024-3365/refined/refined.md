```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user input for the `user_name` parameter in the `admin/users/controller.php` file before storing it in the database.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious script code into the `user_name` field, which is then stored in the database. When an administrator or other user views the user information, this script code executes in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `admin/users/controller.php` with the `action=edit` and a malicious payload in the `user_name` parameter.  The vulnerable application stores this payload in the database. When the user's data is viewed in the admin panel, the payload is executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.  No authentication is explictly stated in the submission, although it is implied that the attacker must at least have a registered user to edit. Also needed is the ability to use the admin panel to view the affected data."
