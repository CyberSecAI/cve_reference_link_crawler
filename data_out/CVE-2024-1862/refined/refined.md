Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `wcr_dismiss_admin_notice` function within the WooCommerce Add to Cart Custom Redirect plugin. This function is intended to handle the dismissal of admin notices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The `wcr_dismiss_admin_notice` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user with the 'contributor' role or higher to call the function.
*   **Arbitrary Option Update:** The function uses `update_option` with user-supplied data (`$_POST['id']`) which is only sanitized by `sanitize_text_field`, which is insufficient, as any option can be targetted. This allows an attacker to set the value of arbitrary WordPress options to 'dismissed'.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can modify sensitive site settings stored as options.
*   **Data Loss:** While the specific impact will depend on the targeted options, the ability to change arbitrary option values could lead to data loss or misconfiguration of the WordPress site. Setting critical options to 'dismissed' can disrupt the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is initiated via HTTP requests to the WordPress site's `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, which handles AJAX requests.
*   **AJAX Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `wp_ajax_wcr_dismiss_admin_notice` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least the 'contributor' role.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `woocommerce-custom-redirect.php` file within the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.14 of the plugin by removing the vulnerable code responsible for the admin notices.
*   The provided changeset shows the removal of the admin notice code and related actions from `woocommerce-custom-redirect.php`
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Lucio SÃ¡, who reported it to Wordfence.
