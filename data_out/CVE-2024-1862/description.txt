The WooCommerce Add to Cart Custom Redirect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wcr_dismiss_admin_notice' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to update the values of arbitrary site options to 'dismissed'.
