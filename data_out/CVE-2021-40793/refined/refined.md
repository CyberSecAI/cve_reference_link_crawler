- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory access vulnerability exists where the software attempts to access a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R). It does not require privileges (PR:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to entice a user to open a crafted file that would trigger the vulnerability in Adobe Premiere Pro. The attacker would need to have the user execute a crafted file locally.
