# The Argo CD web terminal session does not handle the revocation of user permissions properly.

Moderate

## Package

 github.com/argoproj/argo-cd ( Go )

## Affected versions

2.6.0through2.11.3

## Patched versions

2.11.7,2.10.16,2.9.21

## Description

Dear Argo CD Security Team,

We are a security research group. We studied Argo CD v2.11.3 and before, discovering that even if the user's `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions are revoked, the user can still send any Websocket message, which allows the user to view sensitive information. Even though they shouldn't have such access.

## Description

Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows you to get a shell inside a running pod, just like you would with kubectl exec. However, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. [CVE-2023-40025](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c8xw-vjgf-94hr "CVE-2023-40025") Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information.

## Threat model

As a declarative GitOps CD for Kubernetes, we assume that the administrator has enabled the Web-based Terminal function of Argo CD. The administrator grants permissions to the attacker `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, and then revokes the permissions.

## Environment

Kubernetes: v1.30.2

Argo CD: v2.11.3

## Attack steps

### 1. Configure Attack Environment.

#### 1.1 Deploy Argo CD.

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.11.3/manifests/install.yaml

```
#### 1.2 The administrator creates the attacker user 'test'.

Add 'accounts.test: login' to the argocd-cm ConfigMap

#### 1.3 The administrator enables the Web-based Terminal feature of Argo CD.

Set 'exec.enabled' to ”true” on the argocd-cm ConfigMap

Patch the argocd-server ClusterRole to allow argocd-server to exec into pods

```
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods/exec
  verbs:
  - create

```
#### 1.4 Create a GitHub repository with the following contents in the 'dev' directory.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: Pods-reader
  namespace: test
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
—--
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: example-rolebinding
  namespace: test
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: Pods-reader
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: example-serviceaccount
  namespace: test
—--
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: example-serviceaccount
  namespace: test
—--
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: test
spec:
  serviceAccountName: example-serviceaccount
  containers:
  - name: test
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]

```

My GitHub repository is located at<https://github.com/ClownandBox/argocd-lab.git>

#### 1.5 The administrator creates a project named 'test'.

```
cat <<EOF > appproject.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  sourceRepos:
  - https://github.com/ClownandBox/argocd-lab.git
  destinations:
  - name: in-cluster
    namespace: test
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  namespaceResourceWhitelist:
  - group: '*'
    kind: Role
  - group: '*'
    kind: RoleBinding
  - group: '*'
    kind: ServiceAccount
  - group: '*'
    kind: Pod
EOF

```

```
kubectl apply -f appproject.yaml

```

The administrator creates an app named 'test'.

```
kubectl create ns test

```

```
cat <<EOF > app.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: test
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: test
  source:
    path: dev
    repoURL: https://github.com/ClownandBox/argocd-lab.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
EOF

```

```
kubectl apply -f app.yaml

```
#### 1.6 The administrator performs a ‘sync’ on the app

### 2. The administrator grants the attacker 'test' permissions.

Add the following content to the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap

```
data:
  policy.csv: |-
    p, role:operator1, applications, get, test/*, allow
    p, role:operator1, exec, create, test/*, allow
    g, test, role:operator1

```
### 3. The attacker logs into the Argo CD UI and accesses the Terminal interface.

### 4. The administrator revokes all permissions from the attacker but retains access to the UI interface.

Remove the following content from the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap

```
data:
  policy.csv: |-
    p, role:operator1, applications, get, test/*, allow
    p, role:operator1, exec, create, test/*, allow
    g, test, role:operator1

```
### 5. Verify the results.

At this point, the attacker can remain inside the container and perform operations

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
