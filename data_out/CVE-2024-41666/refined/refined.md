Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41666:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Argo CD web terminal session not properly handling the revocation of user permissions. Specifically, after a user's `exec` permissions are revoked, the established WebSocket connection to the terminal remains active, allowing the user to continue executing commands inside the container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient permission checks:**  The application only verifies RBAC permissions during the initial handshake of the WebSocket connection. It fails to validate permissions on subsequent messages sent through the same connection.
- **Lack of real-time permission enforcement:**  Permissions are not re-evaluated during the lifespan of the terminal session, which means revocation of permissions is not effective immediately.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** A user whose `exec` permissions have been revoked can still access and execute commands inside the target container.
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** The attacker can use the terminal to access and potentially leak sensitive information from the container.
- **Compromise of the container:** Continued access could lead to further unauthorized activities, such as modifying data or disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based terminal:** The attack leverages the Argo CD's web-based terminal feature.
- **WebSocket connection:** The vulnerability is exposed through the established WebSocket connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Initial permissions:** The attacker must initially be granted `exec` permissions to the target application in Argo CD.
2. **Open terminal session:** The attacker needs to open and maintain an active terminal session before the administrator revokes the `exec` permission.
3. **Argo CD access:** Requires access to the Argo CD UI.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves verifying RBAC permissions not just during the handshake but on each message sent over the websocket. This is achieved by adding a `validatePermissions` function that checks the permissions before every `Read` operation on the websocket, and sends a permission denied message if the user lacks the necessary permissions, closing the connection.

The code changes are in the files `server/application/terminal.go`, `server/application/websocket.go`, and `server/application/websocket_test.go`. The key changes include:

- Passing the RBAC enforcer and application name to the `newTerminalSession` function.
- Implementing `validatePermissions` in `terminalSession` to enforce permissions on each read.
-  Modifying `Read` function in `terminalSession` to call `validatePermissions` before reading messages from websocket.
- Adding tests to verify RBAC enforcement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- Patches are available in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-40025, but it addresses the scenario where only the `exec` permissions are revoked.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description and provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and its fix.
