{
  "CVE-2016-5546": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect ECDSA signature extraction from the DER input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The OpenJDK Libraries component fails to properly extract the ECDSA signature from the DER input.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted DER input could cause an application to accept a signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools, leading to signature validation bypass.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to make a Java application parse a malicious DER input."
