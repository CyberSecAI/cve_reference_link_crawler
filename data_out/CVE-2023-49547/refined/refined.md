Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the username parameter in the login functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, the application is susceptible to SQL injection via the username parameter when handling the login request, which allows the attacker to manipulate the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication mechanism without knowing the valid credentials using SQL injection in the username field.
- **Database Information Extraction:**  Beyond authentication bypass, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract data from the database using time-based and boolean-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP POST request targeting the login functionality.
- **Manipulated Username Parameter:** The username parameter within the request is injected with a malicious SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the malicious requests.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Technical Details:**

The provided request demonstrates the injection:
```
POST /customer_support/ajax.php?action=login HTTP/1.1
...
username='+or+1%3D1+or+''%3D'&password=password&type=1
```
The injected payload `'+or+1%3D1+or+''%3D'` within the username parameter bypasses the intended authentication logic, causing the application to grant access without proper verification.

The content also mentions that time-based attacks are possible, which further confirms the vulnerability's severity and the potential for information disclosure.
