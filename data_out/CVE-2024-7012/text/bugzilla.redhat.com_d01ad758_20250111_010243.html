| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2299429#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-07-23 05:00:40 UTC  ``` An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Foreman due to Pulpcore when deployed with Gunicorn versions earlier than 22.0. The issue arises from how Apache’s mod_proxy handles header as it fails to unset it properly due to restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers. This allow authentication through malformed header instead. This flaw affects all Katello/Satellite 6.10+ deployments using Pulpcore from version 4.0+ and could potentially allow unauthorized users to gain admin access.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2299429#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:45:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.15 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6335 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6335](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6335)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2299429#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:48:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.13 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6337 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6337](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6337)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2299429#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-04 14:48:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.14 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6336 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6336](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6336)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2299429#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-05 17:25:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:8906 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8906](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8906)   ``` |  |
