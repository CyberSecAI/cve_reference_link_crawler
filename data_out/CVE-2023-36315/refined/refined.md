Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-36315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `action` parameter within the Callback Widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload within the `action` parameter.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious link or visit the page with the malicious code injected in the action parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker must then persuade a user (victim) to visit the manipulated URL.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is the `action` parameter in the Callback Widget.
- The XSS payload used in the exploit is `%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=prompt()%3E&err=AO01`. This payload injects an `<img>` tag that triggers a `prompt()` function when an error occurs (because the `src` is invalid), demonstrating the injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the Callback Widget of PHPJabbers.
- The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description.
