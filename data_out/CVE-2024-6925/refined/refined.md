- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TrueBooker plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, allowing unauthorized modification of plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to unintentionally change plugin settings by tricking them into opening a malicious HTML file. This allows the attacker to change service names, categories, duration, price and description
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing a form that submits data to the vulnerable plugin's settings update endpoint. The attacker then tricks a logged-in admin into opening the HTML file, triggering the unauthorized settings update.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML file.
