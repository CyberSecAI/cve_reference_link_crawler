Based on the provided information, all the commits relate to the same vulnerability fix. The vulnerability lies in the `update_ref_for_cow` function in `fs/btrfs/ctree.c` of the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code previously used a `BUG_ON()` check to verify if an extent buffer belonging to the relocation tree had the full backref flag set. This check was too strict, as it could lead to a kernel panic if the condition was unexpectedly met due to bugs or memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability was the use of `BUG_ON()` which causes a kernel panic (denial of service) instead of proper error handling.
- An inconsistency or corruption in the BTRFS file system data structures could trigger this condition, leading to the kernel panic.
- The vulnerability itself is a logic error or a missing data validation, the `BUG_ON` acted like an assertion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of the vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). If the condition checked by the `BUG_ON()` is triggered, it would result in a kernel panic, making the system unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an inconsistency in the btrfs filesystem metadata when a block belonging to the relocation tree lacks the `BTRFS_BLOCK_FLAG_FULL_BACKREF` flag.
- An attacker could potentially trigger this issue by crafting a malformed btrfs filesystem, exploiting existing bugs that could lead to such inconsistent state.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or manipulate a BTRFS filesystem, such as by mounting a crafted disk image or through other filesystem manipulation techniques.
- The attacker requires a user-space capability to trigger the vulnerable code path, which involves COW operations on the filesystem.

**Additional details:**
- The fix replaces `BUG_ON()` with error handling, logging a critical error message using `btrfs_crit`, and aborting the current transaction using `btrfs_abort_transaction`, returning `-EUCLEAN`.
- This change prevents the kernel panic and provides a more graceful way of handling the unexpected condition.
- The commit message mentions that this situation "should never happen (save for bugs or a potential bad memory)."

In summary, the vulnerability was a missing check, using a too aggressive assertion `BUG_ON` that could be triggered by an inconsistent state of the btrfs metadata, leading to a kernel panic (DoS). The fix replaces this assertion with error handling, making the kernel more robust to inconsistencies.
