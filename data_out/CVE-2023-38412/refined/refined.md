{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of input validation for ssid-like fields, read from HTTP requests, before writing them into NVRAM using `acosNvramConfig_set`. Specifically, the length of these fields is not checked, leading to buffer overflows.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow:  The primary weakness is the unchecked length of SSID-like fields, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer space.",
          "Lack of Input Validation: The system fails to validate the length of input strings read from HTTP requests before storing them in NVRAM."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service (potentially permanent), and arbitrary command injection. This could allow an attacker to cause device malfunction or gain unauthorized access to the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP Request Manipulation: Attackers manipulate HTTP requests to include long ssid-like fields that cause buffer overflows when written to NVRAM.",
        "Authenticated access: The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the malicious requests."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to send authenticated HTTP requests to the device. Specific knowledge of vulnerable parameters and device API is also required."

It also includes screenshots with function addresses to better illustrate vulnerable code portions. It suggests that other Netgear products and versions are also potentially vulnerable."
