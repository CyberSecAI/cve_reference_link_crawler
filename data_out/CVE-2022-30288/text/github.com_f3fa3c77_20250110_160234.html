| Agoo currently does not support request validations meaning cycle fragment requests lead to unbounded results causing instances of Agoo to crash.  Sample exploit script:  ``` query test {   __schema {     ...A   } }  fragment A on __Schema { 	types {     fields {       name     }   }   ...B }  fragment B on __Schema { 	...A }  ```  For more information see: <https://github.com/nicholasaleks/graphql-threat-matrix/blob/master/implementations/agoo.md>  Spec ref: <https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Fragment-spreads-must-not-form-cycles> |
