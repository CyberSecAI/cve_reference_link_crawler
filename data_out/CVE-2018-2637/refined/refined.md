Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-2637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The JMX component of OpenJDK failed to properly set the deserialization filter for the `SingleEntryRegistry` in certain cases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper deserialization filter configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker could bypass intended deserialization restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted serialized data to the vulnerable JMX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a Java application exposing a vulnerable JMX endpoint. They need to be able to craft a specific serialized object that will bypass the improper deserialization filter.

**Additional Information from the analyzed content:**

* The vulnerability affects both OpenJDK and IBM JDK implementations.
*   The vulnerability is described as affecting "certain cases," suggesting that not all JMX configurations are vulnerable.
*   The issue can lead to sandbox bypass for java applications.
* The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:0349) indicates that this vulnerability affects java-1.7.0-openjdk.
* The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:0351) indicates that this vulnerability affects java-1.8.0-ibm.
* The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:1463) indicates that this vulnerability affects java-1.8.0-ibm.
* The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:0095) indicates that this vulnerability affects java-1.8.0-openjdk.
