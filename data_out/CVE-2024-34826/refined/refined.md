Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "broken access control issue," meaning there's a missing check for authorization, authentication, or a nonce token in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to perform actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:**  The core issue is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to privileged functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as "moderately dangerous" and expected to be exploited, but the specific impact varies depending on the specific function that can be accessed without authorization. This could lead to various actions being performed by a user with insufficient permissions, potentially causing data modification, privilege escalation or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the CF7 WOW Styler plugin that lacks proper access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber," which is a low-level user role within WordPress. This means any user with a basic account on a WordPress site can potentially exploit this vulnerability, they do not need to be an admin or editor.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects CF7 WOW Styler plugin versions 1.6.4 and earlier.
*   It is fixed in version 1.6.5
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability while users update.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
*   The CVSS score is 6.3, which is considered medium severity.
