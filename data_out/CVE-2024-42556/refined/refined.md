**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Hotel-Management-System is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection through the `/admin_room_removed.php` URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, implying an attacker could gain access to sensitive data or administrative control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin_room_removed.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Input Parameters:** The `rooms` and `noofrooms` parameters in the POST request are manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know that the `/admin_room_removed.php` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to Craft SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker must be able to create SQL injection payloads. The provided sqlmap command gives an example of automated exploitation of the vulnerability.
