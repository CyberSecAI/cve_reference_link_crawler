Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the EC-CUBE 2 series, specifically in the "mail/template" and "products/product" sections of the admin panel. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is an XSS vulnerability (CWE-79) caused by a lack of proper input sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other administrators or users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of other administrators or users who access affected pages.
- **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious code, an attacker could potentially gain control of administrator accounts, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the admin panel, specifically within "mail/template" and "products/product" input fields.
- An attacker needs to be able to log in to the admin panel to inject malicious scripts, this implies they need to have administrative privileges or have compromised an admin account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker must have access to the administrative panel of the EC-CUBE instance.
- **Script Injection Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious scripts.

**Affected Versions:**
- EC-CUBE 2.11.0 to 2.11.5
- EC-CUBE 2.12.0 to 2.12.6
- EC-CUBE 2.13.0 to 2.13.5-p1
- EC-CUBE 2.17.0 to 2.17.2-p1

**Mitigation:**
The vendor provides patches that sanitize the input, preventing the execution of malicious code. The patches primarily involve modifying `modifier.script_escape.php` or applying the `script_escape_ex` modifier in multiple templates to sanitize the content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes detailed patch information including file modifications for different versions.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "low" severity by the vendor, but JPCERT rates it as medium with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 and CVSS v2 base score of 2.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
