Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper authorization within the Intel® Performance Maximizer (PM) software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software lacks proper authorization checks, which allows a privileged user to potentially escalate their privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privileges, allowing the attacker to gain higher-level access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning the attacker must have some form of access to the system where Intel PM software is installed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the local system. The attack vector is local, and no user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as a **Medium** severity.
*   Intel has discontinued the Intel® PM software and recommends users to uninstall it.
*   Intel suggests that users should switch to Intel® Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) software as an alternative.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Marius Gabriel Mihai.
*   CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local) - The vulnerability requires local access.
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low) - The attack is easy to carry out.
    *   **PR:H** (Privileges Required: High) - The attacker needs to be a privileged user
    *  **UI:N** (User Interaction: None) - No user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged) -  The vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality Impact: High) - There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High) - There is a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:H** (Availability Impact: High) - There is a high impact on availability.
