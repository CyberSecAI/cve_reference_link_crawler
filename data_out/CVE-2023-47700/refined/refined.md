- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The certificate for a remote system in a policy-based replication partnership is not correctly validated in the GUI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation in the GUI of IBM Storage Virtualize products.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate communications between systems involved in policy-based replication.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation would likely involve a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting communications and presenting a malicious certificate during the replication process through the GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the systems and have the ability to present a fake certificate during communication. They likely would also need knowledge of the replication configuration to target.
