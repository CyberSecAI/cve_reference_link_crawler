### @WithoutPants **[WithoutPants](/WithoutPants)** commented [May 22, 2024](#issue-2309520034)

Fixes vulnerability to SQL injection when entering specific values into the `sort` URL parameter. Changes the behaviour so that sort strings are validated against a white list of values and returns an error if it is not a valid value.

Fixes [CVE-2024-32231](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75jf-52jg-qqh4 "CVE-2024-32231")

### **[Cvrt19](/Cvrt19)** commented [Jun 9, 2024](#issuecomment-2156724936)

| Would it be possible to just add all of the possible filtering options to the list of allowed sorts? I had been using "career\_length" to unofficially sort Performers by debut (by putting sort=career\_length manually in the address bar) and it was working great, but this fix breaks that method. There may also be people who want to sort by "weight" or maybe even by "country." |
