Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a change introduced by [YARN-10495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495), which modified the library loading path for the `container-executor` binary in Apache Hadoop. Instead of loading libraries from `$ORIGIN/`, it was changed to `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. This allowed for a malicious `libcrypto.so` library to be loaded from a user-writable directory, leading to privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Library Loading Path:** The modified `RUNPATH` or `RPATH` in the `container-executor` binary (`$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`) allows loading of shared libraries from a relative path outside of the intended directories.
- **SUID bit on `container-executor`:** The `container-executor` binary has the SUID bit set and is owned by root, which is necessary for running containers as specific users but also introduces risk if the library path is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can gain root privileges by placing a malicious shared library (specifically `libcrypto.so`) in a user-writable path, and then triggering the execution of `container-executor`.
- **Remote Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users and their jobs are executed on the physical host rather than a container, a remote user can potentially gain root privileges as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local User Exploitation:** A user with local access to the system can place a malicious library in a directory to which they have write access.
- **Remote User Exploitation (Conditional):** A remote authenticated user can submit a job that, if executed directly on the host, can exploit this vulnerability. This is dependent on the specifics of the YARN cluster configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the system with write access to specific directories where they can place the malicious library.
- **Remote User (Conditional):** The attacker needs to be a remote user who is authorized to submit jobs to the YARN cluster and the cluster must be configured such that the job is not executed inside a container.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Versions:** Apache Hadoop versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 are affected.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Hadoop version 3.3.5, which reverts the library loading path change.
- **Verification:** You can check if a `container-executor` binary is vulnerable by using the command `readelf -d container-executor|grep 'RUNPATH\|RPATH'`. If the output contains `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`, the binary is vulnerable.
- **SUID Bit:** The vulnerable binary has the SUID bit set and is owned by root.
- **Mitigation:** Versions of Hadoop prior to 3.3.1 and after 3.3.4 are not vulnerable. The official recommendation is to upgrade to 3.3.5 or higher, or to remove the setuid bit from the container-executor binary (though this disables Secure Container support)

**NetApp Products:**

- NetApp acknowledges that some of their products use vulnerable versions of Apache Hadoop. However, the advisory states that **none** of the listed NetApp products are affected. This may imply that while NetApp uses Hadoop, they may not be using the vulnerable components in their listed products, or may have already applied a fix.

This summary provides a comprehensive breakdown of the vulnerability, including the technical details and how it can be exploited, as well as specific mitigation information.
