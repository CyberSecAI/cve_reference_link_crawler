## Description

### Summary

Broken encryption in app-functions-sdk “AES” transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors.

### Detailed Description

The app-functions-sdk exports an “aes” transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation in <https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0/pkg/transforms/encryption.go>

Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the “aes” transform and provides an improved “aes256” transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation.

### Impact

As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new "aes256" transform.

#### Vulnerable go modules

* github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go < v2.1.0
* github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v2 < v2.1.0
* github.com/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable < v2.1.0

#### Vulnerable containers

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable> >= 2.0.0 < v2.1.0
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable-arm64> >= 2.0.0 < 2.1.0
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/docker-app-service-configurable> < 2.0.0
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/docker-app-service-configurable-arm64> < 2.0.0

#### Vulnerable Snaps

* <https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable> >= 2.0.0 < 2.1.0

### Patches

Upgrade to 2.1.0 version of app-functions-sdk-go/v2, app-service-configurable, and related docker containers shown below and modify user scripts to use the new "aes256" transform in place of the existing "aes" transform.

#### Patched go modules

* github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v2 v2.1.0
* github.com/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable v2.1.0

Modification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.

#### Patched containers

* [https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable:>=2.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable%3A%3E%3D2.1.0)
* [https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable-arm64:>=2.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable-arm64%3A%3E%3D2.1.0)

Modification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.

#### Patched Snaps

* <https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable> >= 2.1.0

Modification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.

### Workarounds

If unable to upgrade, change the processing pipeline to use an HTTPS (TLS 1.3) endpoint to export and skip encryption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
