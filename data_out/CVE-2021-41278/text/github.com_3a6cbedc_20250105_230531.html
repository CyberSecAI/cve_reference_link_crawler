|  |  |  |
|  |  | This package contains code retrieved from https://github.com/codahale/etm on 2021-10-28. It implements the crypto.AEAD interface using AES-CBC encryption and sha hashing algorithms. It was stripped of all aead constructions other than `AEAD\_AES\_256\_CBC\_HMAC\_SHA\_512` to fit our usage. |

|  |  | // |
|  |  | // An AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) construction provides |
|  |  | // a unified API for sealing messages in a way which provides both |
|  |  | // confidentiality \*and\* integrity. |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // This not only prevents malicious tampering but also eliminates online attacks |
|  |  | // like padding oracle attacks which can allow an attacker to recover plaintexts |
|  |  | // without knowledge of the secret key (e.g., Lucky 13 attack, BEAST attack, |
|  |  | // etc.). |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // By rejecting ciphertexts which have been modified, these types of attacks are |
|  |  | // eliminated. |

|  |  | // AEAD\_AES\_128\_CBC\_HMAC\_SHA1 |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // All constructions combine AES in CBC mode with an HMAC, but vary in the |
|  |  | // degree of security offered and the amount of overhead required. See |
