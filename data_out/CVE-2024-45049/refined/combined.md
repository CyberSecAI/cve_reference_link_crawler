# Missing authentication when triggering evaluations

High

[dasJ](/dasJ)
published
GHSA-xv29-v93r-2f5v
Aug 27, 2024

## Package

Hydra

## Affected versions

42d2015357c18a7137ba65e68e67940cb545bc72

## Patched versions

f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to trigger evaluations in Hydra without any authentication. Depending on the size of evaluations, this can impact the availability of systems.

### Patches

The problem can be fixed by applying [f730433](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5) (which depends on [916531d](https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/916531dc9ccee52e6dab256232933fcf6d198158)) to any Hydra package.

Patches for the nixpkgs packages are here:

* [nixpkgs unstable](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337765)
* [nixpkgs 24.05](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337766)

### Workarounds

Deny the `/api/push` route in a reverse proxy. This also breaks the "Evaluate jobset" button in the frontend.

### References

The initial finding was documented here: [https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/113029832631860419](https://mastodon.delroth.net/%40delroth/113029832631860419)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
