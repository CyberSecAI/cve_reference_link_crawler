{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application's URL sanitization logic in `Graph.js` and the `openExternal` function in `electron.js` and `ElectronApp.js` did not properly filter all potentially harmful URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper URL Filtering",
      "Inadequate Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious URLs that, when opened, could lead to arbitrary code execution, phishing attacks, or other security breaches on the user's system. This is especially concerning in the context of the Electron app, where system-level access is possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious links embedded in diagram files",
        "Crafted URLs passed to `window.open` within the application",
        "Links within HTML content rendered by the application"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to create or modify diagram files containing malicious URLs or find a way to inject a crafted URL into the application's open function."
  },
    "fixes":{
    "electron.js": "The `openExternal` function now only opens http(s), mailto, tel, and callto links by checking against an allowedUrls regular expression.",
    "ElectronApp.js":"The `window.open` function was modified to use `requestSync` which calls the `openExternal` to filter URLs.",
    "Graph.js": "The `sanitizeHtml` function uses DOMPurify to sanitize HTML values, with an `ALLOWED_URI_REGEXP` which now only allows http(s), mailto, tel, callto, and data URLs."
