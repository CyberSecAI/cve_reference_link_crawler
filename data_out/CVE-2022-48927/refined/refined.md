The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48927.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an incorrect calculation of the size of an array used in the `tsc2046` ADC driver. The code was using `indio_dev->num_channels` which includes all physical channels plus a timestamp channel, while the array (`priv->l`) was allocated only for physical channels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory corruption:** An array overflow could occur when iterating through channels, potentially leading to memory corruption.
- **Incorrect Array Size:** The code uses `indio_dev->num_channels` instead of the correct array size which is `ARRAY_SIZE(priv->l)`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Memory corruption could lead to unpredictable behavior, system instability, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered during the normal operation of the driver when processing ADC data. Specifically when `tsc2046_adc_update_scan_mode` or `tsc2046_adc_setup_spi_msg` functions are called with a scan mask that attempts to use more channels than physically present, or with a software timestamp channel set which is never set by the IIO core.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the vulnerable code paths, which is typically done via normal operation of an application or user that uses the affected driver and device. No special privileges are needed.

The fix replaces `indio_dev->num_channels` with `ARRAY_SIZE(priv->l)` in the `for_each_set_bit` loop in `tsc2046_adc_update_scan_mode` and the `for` loop in `tsc2046_adc_setup_spi_msg`. This ensures that the loop iterates through the correct number of physical channels, preventing the array overflow.
