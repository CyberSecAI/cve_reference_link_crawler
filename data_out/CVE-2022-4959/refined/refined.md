- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly filter or sanitize user-provided input, specifically the user's nickname.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores the user's unfiltered nickname in the database, and this nickname is later displayed on the page without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's nickname, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view content where the nickname is displayed. This can result in various attacks, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within their nickname. When this nickname is displayed on the website, the injected script executes within the browser of a user viewing the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to register an account with the vulnerable application and set their nickname to contain the XSS payload.
