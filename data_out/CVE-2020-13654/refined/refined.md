Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13654:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input in the property displayer of XWiki Platform. Specifically, certain fields such as the "Company" field in the user profile editing section did not sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code injected by an attacker is stored within the application's database and executed whenever a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a page containing the injected code.
*   **Data Theft:** Through XSS, the malicious script can access cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information stored in the victim's browser.
*   **Account Hijacking:** With stolen session tokens, an attacker could potentially hijack the victim's account.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Profile Fields:** The vulnerability is triggered by inserting malicious JavaScript into vulnerable user profile fields, such as the "Company" field.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack is triggered when another user views the profile page of the user with the malicious payload, or in some other cases where the unsanitized data is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit user profiles. It is not specified if this requires any specific role such as "admin", but it is implied that the malicious user can edit the profile of other users.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Fields:** The attacker must know which fields are susceptible to XSS.
*   **Ability to Inject Code:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable fields.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in XWiki Platform versions prior to 12.8.
*   The issue is tracked as XWIKI-17374 in the XWiki JIRA issue tracker.
*   The fix for this issue was included in XWiki versions 12.8, 12.6.3, and 11.10.11.
*   The vulnerability is also related to other issues including XWIKI-9658, XCOMMONS-2016, XWIKI-17766, XWIKI-18565, XWIKI-9680, XWIKI-18038, XWIKI-18049 and XWIKI-18122.
*   A pull request ([#1315](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/1315)) on GitHub was created to address this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves changes to various files including `commentsinline.vm`, `XWikiDocument.java`, `macros.vm`, `TextAreaClass.java`, `ListClass.java`, `StringClass.java` and `xwiki.js`.
