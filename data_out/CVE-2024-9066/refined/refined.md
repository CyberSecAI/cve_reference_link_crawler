Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads within the "Marketing and SEO Booster" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the content of uploaded SVG files), leading to the storage of malicious scripts within the WordPress site's database or file system. These scripts are executed when a user accesses the affected SVG file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of users who access the SVG file.
*   **Potential for various attacks:** This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the upload of a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site.
*   **Author-level Access or Higher:** The attacker needs at least "Author" level privileges to upload files.

**Additional Notes**
* The plugin has been closed as of October 8, 2024 due to the security issue
* No patch available, it is recommended to uninstall the plugin and find a replacement
