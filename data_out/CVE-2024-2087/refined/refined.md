Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2087

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Brizy Page Builder plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the form name values are not properly sanitized, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS through the form name values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute, potentially leading to:
  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
  - Stealing of session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Redirection to malicious websites.
  - Defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the form name values within the Brizy Page Builder plugin.
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts via the vulnerable form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to submit form data with malicious script payload to the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Brizy Page Builder plugin up to and including 2.4.43.
- The vulnerability is located within the `admin/views/form-data.php` file, where the form name values are displayed without proper sanitization.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input using `esc_attr()` when outputting the form name values and using `strip_tags` with `<br>` tag allowed for the field values.
- Patched version: 2.4.44
