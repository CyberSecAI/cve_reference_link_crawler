### Description

The Awesome Support – WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the wpas\_get\_users() function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve user data such as emails. CVE-2024-35741 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
