### Summary:
The provided content describes a missing authorization vulnerability in the `wpas_get_users()` function within the Awesome Support WordPress plugin. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher to retrieve user data, including email addresses.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wpas_get_users()` function, which is accessible via AJAX, lacks proper authorization checks. This allows users with subscriber-level permissions to call the function, which is intended to be used by higher-level users such as agents, to get a list of users and their information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization: The function does not verify if the user has the necessary privileges to access user information.
- Exposure of sensitive data: User data, specifically email addresses, can be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can obtain user data, including email addresses, potentially leading to further attacks such as phishing campaigns.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated users can trigger the AJAX call for `wpas_get_users()` without proper authorization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- The attacker needs to be able to make AJAX requests to the server.
