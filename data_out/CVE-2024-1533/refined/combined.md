I saw there were some negative reviews and just want to give my two cents here. I have built a website with the Phlox theme and elements and I am very happy with it. I never have any issues in my nearly one year of using the plugins or theme. There are never any copatibility issues with other plugins either.
Frequent updates and fast, Averta makes sure the theme works with latest Wordpress changes in matter of hours/days!
They are an excellent developer that has made an excellent theme!

Well, I have used the phlox core plugin before but this time round, it simply breaks my admin and I need to remove the plugin via FTP.
I am raising a support ticket and will revise my review when resolved.
\*\*\*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*
Well, another site and this time it breaks my Theme. (PhLox) config (it simply will not load any theme options).
Clearly I need theme options more than a few widgets…
I de-activate, theme customisation works… I activate it… the theme breaks.
too tired to wait for a solution…
Seems to be very buggy!!!

### Description

The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the HTML Element in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Requires Elementor and the Phlox theme to be installed.
