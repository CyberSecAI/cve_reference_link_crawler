- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `do_wds` function in the Yifan YF325 router's httpd service uses `strcpy` to copy data from the URL path into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` without length validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network request to trigger the `do_wds` function with a URL path that has a length exceeding the buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely without authentication.
