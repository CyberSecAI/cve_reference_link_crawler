The provided content relates to CVE-2024-37869.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the `poster.php` file of the "Online Discussion Forum Project in PHP with Source Code". Specifically, line 120 of `poster.php` directly uses the input obtained via `$_FILES` to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The application does not validate or sanitize the uploaded file's name, type, or content. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading malicious PHP files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- File overwrite, file injection, directory traversal, and denial of service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/members/poster.php` endpoint.
-  The attacker uploads a malicious file through the form field for image uploads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a regular user account to access the file upload functionality.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP request with a malicious file attached.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable file is `poster.php`, specifically line 120.
- The affected software is "Online Discussion Forum Project in PHP with Source Code," Version 1.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by zhongguangyuan, limanshu, and shijiahao at Guangzhou University.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating how to upload a PHP file and then execute it by accessing the uploaded file via URL.
