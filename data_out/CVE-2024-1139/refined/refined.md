   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-1139, confirming it is relevant. The official CVE description is a placeholder. The content provides additional details.

2. **Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The `telemeter-client` pod in `openshift-monitoring` namespace in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) has an annotation that contains a cluster's pull secret for `cloud.openshift.com` and `quay.io` registries. The bug is caused by concatenating the token string with a hash instead of writing the token string to the hash object.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Credentials leak. The pull secret token is exposed in the pod manifest.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with basic login credentials or read access to pod manifests can discover a repository pull secret. This could potentially lead to further access to the container images and the cluster resources by abusing the leaked token.
   - **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker with basic login credentials to OCP or a user with read permissions to the pod manifest can check the pod manifest to discover the repository pull secret token.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - Remote access with basic OCP login credentials to read the pod definition
     - Read access to the pod manifest or deployment.
