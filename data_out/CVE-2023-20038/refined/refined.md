- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because a static key value that is stored in the application can be used to encrypt application data and remote credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a static private key for encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt local data or access remote systems monitored by Cisco IND.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs local access to the server on which Cisco IND is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated, local access to the server.
