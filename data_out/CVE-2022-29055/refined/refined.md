Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from accessing an uninitialized pointer in the SSL VPN portal component. This is a classic case of using memory that hasn't been properly set up or allocated, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer:** The core issue is that the code attempts to dereference a pointer that hasn't been assigned a valid memory address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the crashing of the `sslvpn` daemon. This makes the SSL VPN service unavailable, disrupting network access and potentially other connected services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the SSL VPN portal.
- **Remote:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Authentication:** The need for authentication varies depending on the specific product and version:
    - Some versions of FortiProxy are vulnerable without requiring authentication.
    - Other versions of FortiOS and FortiProxy require the attacker to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the SSL VPN portal.
- For certain vulnerable products, the attacker may need to possess valid authentication credentials.

- **FortiOS:**
    - 6.0 (all versions)
    - 6.2.0 through 6.2.10
    - 6.4.0 through 6.4.3
