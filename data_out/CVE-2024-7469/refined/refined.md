**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system by injecting commands via the web interface. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Full system compromise
    *   Data theft
    *   Denial of service
    *   Malware deployment
    *   Configuration modification

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the web interface of the Raisecom devices.
*   The specific vulnerable component is the `list_vpn_web_custom.php` file, likely involved in processing VPN configuration parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the vulnerable Raisecom device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject commands via the web interface, which likely requires knowledge of the specific vulnerable parameter in the `list_vpn_web_custom.php` file.

**Affected Devices:**
*   Raisecom MSG1200
*   Raisecom MSG2100E
*   Raisecom MSG2200
*   Raisecom MSG2300
*   Firmware Version: 3.90

**Additional Notes:**
