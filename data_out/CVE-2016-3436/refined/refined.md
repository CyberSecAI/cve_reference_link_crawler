Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-3436:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `onapsis.com` explicitly mentions "Oracle E-Business Suite Cross Site Scripting (XSS) CVE-2016-3436" which matches the CVE ID.
*   The Oracle document also lists CVE-2016-3436 in the "Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix" section.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *  The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The specific vulnerable component is located within "Oracle Common Applications Calendar", specifically the "Tasks" functionality.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Stealing Sensitive Business Information:** A remote attacker could steal sensitive information by targeting other users connected to the system. This is achieved by injecting malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser session, enabling the attacker to potentially capture session cookies or other sensitive data.
   *  According to the Oracle document, exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to "High" Confidentiality impact and "Low" Integrity impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP:** The vulnerability is triggered via the HTTP protocol.
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability, meaning they do not need direct access to the server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Oracle E-Business Suite system.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, meaning no username and password are required for initial access to the vulnerable component. However, once an attacker has successfully injected malicious code, they may then be able to perform additional attacks to escalate privileges.
    *   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the malicious script. The Oracle document specifies "Required" User Interaction, which means some level of interaction is needed for the exploit to occur. The target user has to interact with a link or content that has been modified with the malicious script in order to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `onapsis.com` content provides a high-level description of the impact, stating "a remote attacker could steal sensitive business information by targeting other users connected to the system."
*   The Oracle document offers a more technical description within the risk matrix including the CVSS v3 score, attack vector, complexity, privileges required, and the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability, specifying "Network" attack vector with "Low" attack complexity and "High" confidentiality impact.
*   The Oracle document notes that a user must be logged into the E-Business Suite and must interact with the malicious script for the vulnerability to be exploited, whereas the Onapsis article doesn't mention that.

In summary, CVE-2016-3436 is an XSS vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to potentially steal sensitive information by injecting malicious scripts into the application which are then executed by other application users.
