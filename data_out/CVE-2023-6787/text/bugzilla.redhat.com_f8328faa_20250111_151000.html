| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2254375#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-13 16:14:01 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Keycloak. An active keycloak session can be hijacked by initiating a new authentication (having the query parameter `prompt=login`) and forcing the user to enter his credentials once again. If the user cancels this re-authentication by clicking `Restart login`, the account takeover could take place as the new session, with a different SUB, will have the same SID as the previous session.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2254375#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:26:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.10  Via RHSA-2024:1868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1868)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2254375#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:26:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:1867 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1867](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1867)   ``` |  |
