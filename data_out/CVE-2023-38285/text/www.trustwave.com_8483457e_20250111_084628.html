# End of Sale and Trustwave Support for ModSecurity Web Application Firewall

August 26, 2021

Trustwave is announcing the End-of-Life (EOL) of our support for ModSecurity effective July 1, 2024. We will then hand over the maintenance of ModSecurity code back to the open-source community.

Trustwave is also announcing the End-of-Sale (EOS) of Trustwave support for ModSecurity effective August 1, 2021.  No new contracts will be accepted after the EOS date.

Any renewed ModSecurity contracts must contain an expiration date on or before July 1, 2024. Contracts with an expiration date after July 1, 2024, will not be accepted.

### Key dates are as follows:

**Effective Immediately:**

* End-of-Sales (EOS) date was August 1, 2021.
* Contract terms must not extend beyond the July 1, 2024, EOL date.

**ModSecurity Renewal Policy:**

* Clients may renew any time prior to June 30, 2024.
* Contract terms must not extend past the July 1, 2024, EOL date.
* Renewals require a minimum of 100 licenses per contract or an equivalent ACV of USD $42,000.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: Why is Trustwave ending support for ModSecurity?
**A**: Trustwave decided to end our support for ModSecurity to let the open-source community continue the project.

**Q**: Will clients still have access to open-source ModSecurity resources?
**A**: Yes. Clients will continue to have access to all of the open-source resources they currently enjoy, including the source code.

**Q**: What is the impact on clients of end-of-life (EOL)?
**A**: Trustwave will not provide further service, updates, fixes, or new Commercial Rules as of the July 1, 2024, EOL date.

**Q**: Will this affect an existing license?
**A**:  No. Trustwave will continue to release regular updates for the ModSecurity Commercial Rules for those clients that have valid licenses until the EOL date or the expiry of their license, the sooner of the two
