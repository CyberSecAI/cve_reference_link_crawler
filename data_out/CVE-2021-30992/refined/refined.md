- **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way FaceTime handles file metadata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of file metadata can lead to sensitive user information being leaked.
- **Impact:** A user in a FaceTime call might unintentionally leak private information through Live Photos metadata.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a FaceTime call, where a user could potentially share a Live Photo containing the vulnerable metadata.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a FaceTime call with the victim.
