{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition caused by a race condition. When a PGM session is closed, the driver might free the memory associated with a lookaside list. However, if the system thread calls the  `ExpScanGeneralLookasideList`  function after the session is freed, it can lead to an access of freed memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free",
    "Race condition",
     "Incomplete cleanup"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending a sequence of specially crafted network packets that trigger the use-after-free condition, leading to a system crash (bugcheck).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends a sequence of crafted PGM packets to a vulnerable server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a machine running a vulnerable version of Windows where the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol is enabled. They must be able to reach a service that has bound to the PGM protocol."
