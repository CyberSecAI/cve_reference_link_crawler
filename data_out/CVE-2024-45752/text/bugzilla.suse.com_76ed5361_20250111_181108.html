| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1226598#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2024-06-20 11:30:52 UTC  ``` logiops [0][1], in its default configuration, allows any unprivileged user to configure its `logid` daemon via an unrestricted D-Bus service, including setting malicious keyboard macros. This could potentially enable privilege escalation with minimal user interaction required.  The most basic proof-of-concept assigns a shell command to all buttons for connected peripherals. A more crafty attacker could tailor this operation to specific software used on the system, possibly monitoring the process list and mapping malicious macros at exactly the right moment.
