- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Comic Easel plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.15 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website, which are then executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin through an unspecified vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication and can inject the malicious script directly.
