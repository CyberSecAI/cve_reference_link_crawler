- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Fuzz testing identified that certain inputs to functions in the `strvals` package can cause a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow due to parsing of string inputs into array data structures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS). Applications using the `strvals` package in the Helm SDK to parse user-supplied input can crash due to a non-recoverable panic.
- **Attack vectors:** User-supplied string inputs passed to functions in the `strvals` package, such as through command-line flags like `--set` and `--set-string` in the Helm client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input strings that trigger the stack overflow vulnerability in the `strvals` package through user-facing interfaces, such as command-line flags, that utilize the package.
