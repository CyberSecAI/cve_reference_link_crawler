# Denial of service through string value parsing

Moderate

[hickeyma](/hickeyma)
published
GHSA-6rx9-889q-vv2r
Dec 14, 2022

## Package

gomod

helm.sh/helm/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v3.10.2

## Patched versions

v3.10.3

## Description

Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the *strvals* package that can cause a stack overflow. In Go, a stack overflow cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the *strvals* package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.

### Impact

The *strvals* package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The *strvals* package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing a stack overflow.

Applications that use the *strvals* package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.

The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes a stack overflow. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.

### Patches

This issue has been resolved in 3.10.3.

### Workarounds

SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the *strvals* functions.

### For more information

Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.
