Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an alloc-dealloc-mismatch error. Specifically, memory allocated with `operator new[]` is being deallocated with `operator delete`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect memory deallocation:** The code allocates memory using `operator new[]` which is intended for array allocation and should be freed using `operator delete[]`. However, the code attempts to free this memory using `operator delete` which is for single object deallocation.
- **Type confusion:** A char array allocated using `new char[]` is being cast to `MatroskaTrack` object and later on during deallocation, it's not being cast back to char array before deallocating, causing the mismatch.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a crash due to memory corruption. The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) detects this during testing, which leads to the program aborting.
- This issue could lead to more severe issues like heap corruption if not detected by ASAN, potentially causing further program instability or enabling other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted Matroska (.mkv) file. In the provided case, the `PocTsmuxer.mkv` file was used to trigger the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted Matroska file to the `tsMuxer` program. This could be through any interface that allows file input to the tool (CLI or GUI).

**Additional details:**
- The issue occurs within the `MatroskaDemuxer` class, specifically during the handling of tracks.
- The allocation happens within the `MatroskaDemuxer::matroska_add_stream()` function and deallocation happens in `MatroskaDemuxer::readClose()`.
- The fix involves casting the allocated memory back to its original type (char array) before using `delete[]`.
- The provided information also indicates that the issue has been addressed with two commits that correct the memory management.
