The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13978.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code through the Theme module's edit chunk functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload/modification: The theme module allows users with administrative privileges to edit theme chunks which can contain PHP code.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the input provided by the user when editing theme chunks, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary PHP code.
- Code execution: The injected PHP code is directly executed by the server, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- Full system compromise: By injecting malicious PHP code, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the server, leading to data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: Attackers must be able to access the Monstra CMS admin panel.
- Theme module: The vulnerability is specifically located within the "edit_chunk" functionality of the theme module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs administrative privileges to access the admin panel of the Monstra CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the themes module and access the edit chunk feature.
