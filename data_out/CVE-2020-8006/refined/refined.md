Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-8006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a pre-authentication stack-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability lies within the server's HTTP header parsing, specifically during the base64 decoding of the `Basic-Authentication` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The base64 decode function takes three arguments: input pointer, output pointer, and length. The input pointer is attacker-controlled (approximately 4096 bytes), the output pointer is on the stack, and the length argument is 512. Although a length check exists, it only verifies that the length is not less than 3, allowing an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker run-time control of the device as root.
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow could potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning no prior access or credentials are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device hosting the vulnerable server.

**Affected Product:**
- Circontrol Raption EV Chargers, specifically versions up to 5.11.2.
- Affected components include OCCP 1.5, OCCP 1.6 and PWRSTUDIO.
