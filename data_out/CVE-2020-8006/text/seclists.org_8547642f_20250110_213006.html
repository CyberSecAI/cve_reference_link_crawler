Circontrol EV Charger vulnerabilities.

1. CVE-2020-8006 Pre-Auth Stack Based Buffer Overflow
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (10)

The server in Circontrol Raption through 5.11.2 has a pre-authentication
stack-based buffer overflow that can be exploited to gain run-time control
of the device as root.

When the server parses the HTTP headers and finds the Basic-Authentication
tag it will call a base64 decode function. This function takes 3 arguments:
an input pointer, an output pointer and a length. During the authentication
flow, the input pointer can be an attacker controlled string of
approximately 4096 characters, and the output pointer is located on the
stack, the length argument is 512. While the length of the stack based
buffer is passed to the decoder it only verifies that it is not smaller than
3.
