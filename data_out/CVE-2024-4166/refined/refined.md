Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4166 (based on the content provided, which references the same vulnerability and details, it is highly likely this CVE will be assigned to it).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sub_41E858` function of the Tenda 4G300 V1.01.42 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Stack Overflow:** The `v3` variable, which receives input from the `GO` parameter of a POST request, is copied into a local stack buffer (`v10`). The size of the user-controlled input `GO` is not checked which leads to a buffer overflow if the input size is larger than the stack buffer `v10`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, a malicious actor can potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, including the return address of the vulnerable function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request with an overly long value for the `GO` parameter.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device.
* **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the request parameter `GO` which triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The affected firmware version is Tenda 4G300 V1.01.42.
* The vulnerability is in the `sub_41E858` function.
* The `GO` parameter is received through a POST request.
* A proof-of-concept (POC) image shows a request with an oversized GO parameter leading to a crash.
