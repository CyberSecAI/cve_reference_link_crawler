Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)

The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.
At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.
View the web archive through the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php).

Collection: [Live Web Proxy Crawls](https://archive.org/details/liveweb)

Content crawled via the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.

Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archiveâs wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

## MainWP < 3.1.3 admin panel unauthenticated stored XSS

April 29, 2016

[MainWP](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101060009/https%3A//mainwp.com/) is a WordPress remote administration plugin. Missing authorization checks on a
setup panel allowed unauthenticated attackers to modify some of the MainWP settings.
At least one of these settings could be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the WordPress
Dashboard. Under default configuration this leads to server-side code execution.
### Details

After installing MainWP the plugin presents a quick setup panel which asks the administrator
to select and enter some configuration options. When requested in a certain way, the quick setup
page doesn't require login and anyone can alter the settings.

Proof of concept: first, a *nonce* can be retrieved with the following UNIX command:
```

curl 'http://WEBSITE/wp-admin/admin-post.php?page=mainwp-setup&step=installation' | grep _wpnonce

```

The settings can then be modified. The following command exploits a secondary stored XSS to inject some
JavaScript:
```

curl -F 'mwp_setup_purchase_username=aaa" onmouseover=alert(/xss/);//' -F mwp_setup_purchase_passwd=bbb -F save_step=1 'http://WEBSITE/wp-admin/admin-post.php?page=mainwp-setup&step=purchase_extension&_wpnonce=NONCE_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND'

```

The script is stored in the WordPress options database. When any administrator next views
the MainWP Extensions setting panel, the script will be executed, showing an alert box.

As with other WordPress XSS's, the impact of this bug is normally server-side code execution because
the script can e.g. use AJAX requests to access the theme and plugin editors.
### Vendor response

MainWP was notified on April 18. The latest MainWP update addresses this vulnerability. A bug bounty of $50 was awarded.
### Credits

The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Jouko Pynnönen of [Klikki](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101060009/https%3A//klikki.fi/) Oy, Finland.
