- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` application's JSON command parser does not properly validate the type of the `param` JSON element before passing it to API-specific parameter parsers. It assumes the `param` value is always a JSON object and attempts to access it using the subscription operator. However, if a string or other non-object type is provided, it leads to an assertion failure and process termination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) due to the lack of JSON type checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A specially-crafted HTTP request can cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, leading to a device reboot. This results in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON payload where the "param" value is not a JSON object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. In some cases this can be achieved without authentication by exploiting TALOS-2021-1420.
