## Workstation Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1544

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Workstation Service due to a possible "Double Free" condition occurring in the service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1544](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1544).

#### Mitigating Factors for Workstation Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1544

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to a vulnerable system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

#### Workarounds for Workstation Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1544

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Workstation Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1544

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Workstation Service does not properly allocate and free memory when receiving specially crafted RPC messages.

**What is the Workstation service?**

The Workstation service is a Windows component that supports the routing of remote file and network print resource requests. Both local file system requests and remote file or print network requests are routed through the Workstation service. This service determines where the resource is located and then routes the request to the local file system or to the networking components. When the Workstation service is stopped, all requests are assumed to be local requests.

**What is a "double free"condition?**

A double free condition is a condition in which a program is caused to release or free allocated memory more than once. Releasing memory that has already been freed could lead to memory corruption. An attacker could add arbitrary code to memory that is then executed when the corruption occurs. This code could then be executed at a system level of privilege.

Typically, this vulnerability will cause a denial of service to occur. However, in some circumstances, code execution could occur. Because of the unique layout of the memory on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could be difficult.

**What is Remote Procedure Call (RPC)?**

Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is an interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism that enables data exchange and invocation of functionality residing in a different process. That process can be on the same computer, on the local area network (LAN), or across the Internet. The Microsoft RPC mechanism uses other IPC mechanisms, such as named pipes, NetBIOS, or Winsock, to establish communications between the client and the server. With RPC, essential program logic and related procedure code can exist on different computers, which is important for distributed applications. For more information, see the TechNet article, What Is RPC?

**Can I disable the Workstation service to prevent this attack from succeeding?**

Disabling the Workstation service is not recommended as a workaround for this vulnerability. If the Workstation service is disabled, the system cannot connect to any shared file resources or shared print resources on a network. Only use this workaround on stand-alone systems (such as many home systems) that do not connect to a network. If the Workstation service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Workstation service do not start, and an error message is logged in the system event log. The following services depend on the Workstation service:

* Alerter
* Browser
* Messenger
* Net Logon
* RPC Locator

These services are required to access resources on a network and to perform domain authentication. Internet connectivity and browsing for stand-alone systems, such as users on dial-up connections, on DSL connections, or on cable modem connections, should not be affected if these services are disabled.

**Note:** The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer will not function if the Workstation service is disabled.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted RPC message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then allow an authenticated client to write arbitrary data to memory in the Workstation service address space.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All systems with the Workstation service enabled are at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Workstation service allocates and frees memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-223A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft Office
* Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac.

Microsoft has released multiple security bulletins for critical vulnerabilities in Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components, and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. These bulletins are described in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx).

Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-037.mspx) includes updates for Microsoft components to address vulnerabilities in the Active Template Library ([ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28VS.71%29.aspx)). Vulnerabilities present in the ATL can cause vulnerabilities in the resulting ActiveX controls and COM components. Any ActiveX control or COM component that was created with a vulnerable version of the ATL may be vulnerable, including ones distributed by third-party developers.

Developers should update the ATL as described in the previously released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx) in order to stop creating vulnerable controls. To address vulnerabilities in existing controls, recompile the controls using the updated ATL. Further discussion about the ATL vulnerabilities can be found in the [Microsoft Security Advisory 973882](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/973882.mspx).

### Impact

An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, in some cases without user interaction.

### Solution

**Apply updates from Microsoft**

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as [Windows Server Update Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx) (WSUS).
