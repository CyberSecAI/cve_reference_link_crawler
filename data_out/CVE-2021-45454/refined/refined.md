{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Telemetry information made available through the Linux OS HWMon subsystem, which is used by the Ampere速 Altra速 HWmon driver, allows unprivileged SW access to telemetry.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Linux kernel driver allows an authenticated user to obtain power telemetry information on Ampere速 Altra速 Family CPUs via HWmon.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential loss of confidential information.  An attacker could potentially reverse engineer confidential data of another tenant on the same system by observing power telemetry.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can access HWmon telemetry data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user on a multi-tenant system."
