Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-35056:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure SQL query string construction within the `query_packets` functions of the NASA AIT-Core software, specifically in its InfluxDB and SQLite3 implementations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `query_packets` function builds SQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled input, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The verification of the packet ID after the SQL query construction is limited and doesn't prevent SQL Injection, only checking if a packet exists, and requiring attackers to modify the `tlm.yaml` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Although the SQLi is considered harmless in the case of InfluxDB, the SQLite implementation can be exploited to perform unauthorized database modifications and retrieve sensitive information.
*   **Command Injection:**  Depending on the system configuration, exploitation could lead to command injection, lateral movements, and even privilege escalation by loading malicious SQLite extensions.
*   **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker might be able to move between systems and gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   **Direct Interaction with the System:** By providing specially crafted input to the `query_packets` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the system running AIT-Core or be able to interact directly with it.
*   **Knowledge of AIT-Core's API:** Attackers need to understand how to call the `query_packets` function with malicious SQL code, and in the case of exploiting the SQLite database, must modify the tlm.yaml file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in AIT-Core versions 2.5.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   The CVSS v4 score is 9.3, indicating a critical severity.
*   The exploitability metrics are: Attack Vector: Network; Attack Complexity: Low; Attack Requirements: None; Privileges Required: None; User interaction: None
*   The impact metrics are: Confidentiality: High; Integrity: High; Availability: High

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by outlining the vulnerable function and providing examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited. It also notes that the verification of the packet ID after the vulnerable SQL construction is insufficient.
