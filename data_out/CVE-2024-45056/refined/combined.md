# `fold (xor (shl 1, x), -1) -> (rotl ~1, x)` misoptimization

Moderate

[hedgar2017](/hedgar2017)
published
GHSA-fpx7-8vc6-frjj
Aug 29, 2024

## Package

zksolc
(Solidity)

## Affected versions

< 1.5.3

## Patched versions

1.5.3

## Description

### Impact

All LLVM versions since [2015](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e48237df95b49a36b8ffceb78c8a58f4be1b4344) fold `(xor (shl 1, x), -1)` to `(rotl ~1, x)` if run with optimizations enabled.

Here `~1` is generated as an unsigned 64 bits number (`2^64-1`). This number is zero-extended to 256 bits on EraVM target while it should have been sign-extended. Thus instead of producing `roti 2^256 - 1, x` the compiler produces `rotl 2^64 - 1, x`.

In Solidity, the bug has been confirmed to be reproducible with the following pattern:

```
    function bug(
        uint256 data,
        uint256 index,
    ) public pure returns(uint256) {
        uint256 bit = 1 << index;
        data &= ~bit;
        return data;
    }

```

Analysis has shown that no contracts were affected by the date of publishing this advisory.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.5.3.

### Workarounds

Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-45056

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

DAGCombiner: fold (xor (shl 1, x), -1) -> (rotl ~1, x)

```
Targets which provide a rotate make it possible to replace a sequence of
(XOR (SHL 1, x), -1) with (ROTL ~1, x).  This saves an instruction on
architectures like X86 and POWER(64).
