Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `openfile` function within the CRMEB Mall commercial version. The function intends to restrict file access to the website's root directory but uses `strpos` for path validation. This allows directory traversal using `..` sequences because `strpos` only checks if the root directory string exists within the filepath string, not if it is a prefix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to traverse directories outside of the intended root directory using "../" sequences in the filepath parameter.
*   **Insecure File Access:** The `readFile` function directly utilizes `file_get_contents` without further security checks, enabling arbitrary file reads.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `strpos` check is inadequate for preventing directory traversal attacks. It does not properly validate if the path is within the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read system files (e.g., system.ini) to gather system information.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** With sensitive information disclosed, further attacks may become possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/adminapi/system/file/openfile` endpoint.
*   **`filepath` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `filepath` parameter to include directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable endpoint `/adminapi/system/file/openfile`.
*   **Knowledge of Root Path:** While not strictly required, knowing the web root directory can simplify constructing the path traversal payload. The root path is visible when editing a file through the user interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code snippets clearly show the vulnerable `openfile` and `readFile` functions.
*   The described attack method is practical and includes a demonstration using `system.ini`.
* The vulnerability was discovered in the CRMEB Mall commercial version.
* The vendor's official website is <https://www.crmeb.com/>.
