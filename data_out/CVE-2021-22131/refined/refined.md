- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of the certificate with host mismatch.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application fails to properly validate the certificate, specifically not checking if the hostname in the certificate matches the server it's connecting to. This is described as an Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch vulnerability [CWE-297].
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by spoofing the validation server identity. This could lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the application and the validation server can intercept and modify traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the FortiToken Mobile app and the validation server. This usually requires being on the same network (local or adjacent network).
