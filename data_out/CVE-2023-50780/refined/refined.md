- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Exposure of the Log4J2 MBean through the authenticated Jolokia endpoint to non-administrative users. This MBean was not intended for such access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure exposure of sensitive MBeans (Log4J2 MBean) to authenticated but not necessarily administrative users.
    - Lack of proper access control on the Jolokia endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An authenticated attacker can write arbitrary files to the filesystem.
    - This can indirectly lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the authenticated Jolokia endpoint, which exposes the Log4J2 MBean.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.
    - The attacker does not need to be an administrator, suggesting that access controls are not sufficiently granular.
