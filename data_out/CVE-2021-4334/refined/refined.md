Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `fpd_update_options` function of the Fancy Product Designer WordPress plugin. This function allows for the modification of site options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks. The `fpd_update_options` function doesn't verify if the user has the necessary permissions to modify site options.
- **Insecure Function:** The vulnerable `fpd_update_options` function allows modification of arbitrary site options without proper privilege verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Site Option Modification:** Attackers can modify any site option, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A key impact is the ability to change the default user role to "administrator." This allows a low-privilege attacker to grant themselves administrative access, gaining full control of the website.
- **Complete Compromise:** The ability to modify any site option and escalate privileges can lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the WordPress plugin's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Access to the Vulnerable Function:** The attacker must be able to call the `fpd_update_options` function.
