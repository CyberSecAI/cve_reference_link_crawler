### Description

The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of site options due to a missing capability check on the fpd\_update\_options function in versions up to, and including, 4.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions to modify site options, including setting the default role to administrator which can allow privilege escalation.
