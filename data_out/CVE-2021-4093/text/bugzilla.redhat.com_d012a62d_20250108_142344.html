The main commit fix is:  - KVM: SEV-ES: go over the sev_pio_data buffer in multiple passes if needed   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=95e16b4>]  Together with the following preparative commits:  - KVM: SEV-ES: rename guest_ins_data to sev_pio_data   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b599840>]  - KVM: x86: leave vcpu->arch.pio.count alone in emulator_pio_in_out   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0d33b1b>]  - KVM: SEV-ES: clean up kvm_sev_es_ins/outs   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ea724ea>]  - KVM: x86: split the two parts of emulator_pio_in   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3b27de2>]  - KVM: x86: remove unnecessary arguments from complete_emulator_pio_in   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6b5efc9>]  - KVM: SEV-ES: keep INS functions together   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4fa4b38>]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2028584#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-12-10 10:43:23 UTC  ``` Also consider the following commit, which fixes a related issue:  - KVM: SEV-ES: fix another issue with string I/O VMGEXITs   [<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9b0971c>]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2028584#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-12-10 13:48:16 UTC  ``` AMD SEV-ES support was introduced in upstream kernel v5.10:  <http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2010.1/05072.html>  RHEL-6 and RHEL-7 kernels are not affected by this flaw as they did not include support for SEV-ES (not even for SEV, FWIW).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2028584#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-12-13 10:11:26 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=2028584#c0): > A KVM guest using SEV-ES (Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Encrypted State) > can trigger out-of-bounds reads and writes in the host kernel via a > malicious VMGEXIT using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO.  In particular, the flaw occurs in sev_es_string_io() while handling string I/O instructions (e.g. outs or ins). The string is copied from the unencrypted guest memory into GHCB (Guest-Hypervisor Communication Block) using guest-controlled values for the length and I/O access size. At some point, the control flow will reach emulator_pio_out() where data is copied into `vcpu->arch.pio_data` which is only one virtual page size in length. If the guest provides a size that makes the memcpy() exceeds one page, it will trigger an out of bounds read/write access on adjacent pages.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2028584#c11)  Justin M. Forbes    2022-01-05 14:37:48 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.14.15 stable kernel updates.   ``` |  |
