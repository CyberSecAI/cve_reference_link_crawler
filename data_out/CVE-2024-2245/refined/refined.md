The provided content is related to CVE-2024-2245.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'username' parameter during the installation process of moziloCMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
* Stealing session cookies.
* Defacing the website.
* Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
* Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `/install.php` endpoint with a malicious JavaScript payload in the 'username' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. They only need to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The user interaction (UI:R) indicates that a user needs to interact with the payload, likely by accessing the affected page after the malicious request.
