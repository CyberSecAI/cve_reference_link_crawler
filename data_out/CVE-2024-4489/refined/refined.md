### Summary of CVE-2024-4489

The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress, specifically in versions up to and including 1.3.976.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `custom_upload_mimes` function. This function allows users to upload various file types, including SVG files. Due to the lack of proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within an SVG file, which will be executed when a user accesses the page where the SVG is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored within the WordPress database and gets executed when a user accesses the affected content.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (SVG files) before storing it.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape output, allowing the stored malicious script to be rendered and executed in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or inject other malware.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website, injecting malicious content or redirecting users to other sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the upload of a malicious SVG file. This could happen via the plugin's settings, or by abusing any functionality that permits uploading SVG files, such as Media Library.
*   **Targeted Injection:** The stored XSS could potentially be injected to specific pages or content areas which might target certain user groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Author" level privileges to upload files.
*   **Access to Plugin Features:** The attacker must have access to the plugin's functionality, that allows uploading files (e.g. SVG files).

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `custom_upload_mimes` function.
*   The fix is included in version 1.3.977 of the plugin.
*   The Wordfence article identifies the researcher as "wesley (wcraft)"
