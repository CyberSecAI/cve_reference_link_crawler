# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-003: Information Disclosure due to Out-of-scope Site Resolution

Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development"),

[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to information disclosure.

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS
* **Subcomponent:** URL Routing (ext:core)
* **Release Date:** July 25, 2023
* **Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure
* **Affected Versions:** 9.4.0-9.5.41, 10.0.0-10.4.38, 11.0.0-11.5.29, 12.0.0-12.4.3
* **Severity:** Low
* **Suggested CVSS:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* **References:** [CVE-2023-38499](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38499), [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)

### Problem Description

In multi-site scenarios, enumerating the HTTP query parameters id and L allowed out-of-scope access to rendered content in the website frontend. For instance, this allowed visitors to access content of an internal site by adding handcrafted query parameters to the URL of a site that was publicly available.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, 12.4.4 that fix the problem described above.

**Strong security defaults - Manual actions required**

 Resolving sites by the *id* and *L* HTTP query parameters is now denied per default. However, it is still allowed to resolve a particular page by e.g. [example.org](https://example.org/?id=123&amp;L=0) - as long as the *page-id 123* is in the scope of the site configured for the *base-url example.org*.

 The new feature flag *security.frontend.allowInsecureSiteResolutionByQueryParameters* - which is disabled per default - can be used to reactivate the previous behavior.

### Credits

Thanks to Garvin Hicking who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note

All security related code changes are tagged so that you can easily look them up in our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[SECURITY] Avoid out-of-scope page access for non-matching site

```
This change disallows calling an URI with page-id query parameters
that are not part of a particular site - for instance the following
URL `<https://example.org/?id=3000&L=0`> has two aspects:

* the site `example.org` has the root page-id 1000
* the site `internal.example.org` has the root page-id 3000

The example above allows to call a page-id for an internal site,
by using a valid and public entry point.

The new feature flag
`security.frontend.allowInsecureSiteResolutionByQueryParameters`
allows to control this behavior for backward compatibility reasons.
Per default `allowInsecureSiteResolutionByQueryParameters` is disabled.
