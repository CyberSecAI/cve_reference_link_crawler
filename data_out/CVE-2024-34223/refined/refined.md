Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure permission controls in the `/hrm/leaverequest.php` file of the SourceCodester Human Resource Management System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper authorization checks on the `leaverequest.php` page.
- The application allows users to modify the leave status of their requests (self-approve/reject) via URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Normal users can approve or reject their own leave requests, which should be a task performed by HR/admin roles.
- This could lead to manipulated leave records, unauthorized time off, and disruptions in scheduling and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct manipulation of the URL using parameters `msg` and `id` to approve or reject leave requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires a valid user account within the vulnerable application.
- Attacker needs to know that `msg` and `id` parameters in `leaverequest.php` can be used to manipulate the leave request status.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes a PoC (Insecure\_permission\_leave.mp4), which is not provided but indicates a practical demonstration of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable parameters are `?msg=` and `?id=`.
- The `id` parameter is used to approve the leave request, and the `msg` parameter is used to reject the request.
