The provided content relates to CVE-2024-8604.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Create New Account" form of the Online Food Ordering System v2, specifically within the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores user-provided data without proper validation or sanitization, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of any user who views the page containing the injected malicious script. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Stealing of sensitive information.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability through the web interface.
- Input Fields: The attack vector is the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields in the "Create New Account" form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Create New Account" form on the vulnerable website.
- The attacker needs to be able to input malicious payloads into the vulnerable fields.
