- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the `name` attribute in `iframe` HTML tags, which allows for DOM clobbering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability through DOM clobbering. The application allows the `name` attribute in iframes without proper sanitization, which can be exploited to overwrite Javascript objects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload with a specially crafted iframe tag and embeds it into a shared note on `Hackmd.io`. The victim opens the malicious note.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a shared note. The victim must open the malicious note from the attacker.
