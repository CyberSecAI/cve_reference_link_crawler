# Cross-site Scripting in Hackmd.io Notes lead by HTML Injection

High

GHSA-22jv-vch8-2vp9
Jul 10, 2024

## Package

npm

codimd
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

2.5.3

## Patched versions

2.5.4

## Description

### Summary

The notebook feature of Hackmd.io permits the rendering of iframe `HTML` tags with an improperly sanitized `name` attribute. This vulnerability enables attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via DOM clobbering.

### Details

During the rendering of user-provided HTML tags, the script sanitizer configuration lacks proper setup in terms of whitelisted attributes. Currently, the `name` attribute is permitted for `iframe` HTML tags. This inclusion is problematic as the `name` attributes of certain HTML tags, such as `form` and `iframe`, can overshadow the result of document object lookups (e.g., `document.script`) via DOM clobbering. DOM clobbering is a technique where HTML structure manipulations can alter JavaScript object properties unintentionally. For a comprehensive explanation of DOM clobbering, refer to [DOM Clobbering Wiki](https://domclob.xyz/domc_wiki/).

```
https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/blob/develop/public/js/render.js#L23
// allow ifram tag with some safe attributes
whiteList.iframe = ['allowfullscreen', 'name', 'referrerpolicy', 'src', 'width', 'height']

```
### PoC

The victim will be alerted with `document.cookie` by clicking the following url (a shared notes).

* <https://hackmd.io/YsI26fr6TA2vDTGl3OMQlQ>

The payload:

```
<iframe name="scripts" src=”https://api.google.com/js/api.js”>alert(document.cookie)</iframe>
<iframe name="scripts" src=”https://api.google.com/js/api.js”>alert(document.cookie)</iframe>

```
### Impact

Any user who opens a shared note containing the malicious payload from an attacker on `Hackmd.io` is susceptible to the effects of this vulnerability, such as having their cookies stolen.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
