# Detection: Splunk RCE via Splunk Secure Gateway Splunk Mobile alerts feature

[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies potential exploitation attempts against the Splunk Secure Gateway App's Mobile Alerts feature in Splunk versions 9.0, 8.2.x, and 8.1.x. It detects suspicious activity by monitoring requests to the mobile alerts endpoint using specific URI paths and query parameters. This activity is significant because an authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, compromising the integrity and security of the Splunk environment.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

This search only applies if Splunk Mobile Gateway is deployed in the vulnerable Splunk versions.

### Known False Positives

This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the \_internal index. Focus of this search is "uri\_path=/servicesNS/nobody/splunk\_secure\_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile\_alerts\*" which is the injection point.

### Associated Analytic Story

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible exploitation attempt from $clientip$ | 81 | 90 | 90 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
