The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47378.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in the NVMe over RDMA (nvme-rdma) driver. The driver was destroying the queue pair (qp) before destroying the communication manager ID (cm_id). If a communication manager event occurred after the qp was destroyed, it could lead to a use-after-free because the driver would try to access the qp which was already freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the nvme-rdma driver.
- Incorrect order of resource destruction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to accessing freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an RDMA connection establishment error flow, which would cause a communication manager event after the queue pair is destroyed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to trigger RDMA connection establishment errors.
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the system at a level where they can trigger NVMe over RDMA operations.
