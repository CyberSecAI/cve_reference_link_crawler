PoC：

The default configuration after DCF installation is to access it without authorization，similar to the figure below.

![mstsc_m4vJSavcxo](data:image/png;base64...)

Allowing a user to have full control over the filename at the point of viewing the log file can cause arbitrary file reads and directory traversal vulnerabilities.

![image-20240202143339996](data:image/png;base64...)

![BurpSuiteCommunity_ITLEBTfzsT](data:image/png;base64...)

The following picture shows the effect of reading from any file. payload: `/cgi-bin/format_logfile.pl?/etc/passwd`

![mstsc_lwJUEgsy2A](data:image/png;base64...)

Directory traversal. payload: `?/` . All files in the root directory will be displayed.

![image-20240202144733619](data:image/png;base64...)

And when we splice the pipe character `|` after the filename, then the file will be executed, giving the effect of remote command execution.
