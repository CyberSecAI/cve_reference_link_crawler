# DLink Router DIR878 Vulnerability

This is a command injection vulnerability access from web server on 192.168.0.1.

## detail

1. /bin/proc.cgi handle user input from web server, and store it in nvram with a inadequate check.
2. /lib/librcm.so get this value from nvram and do some strcat, execute it by `twsystem` without check, which causes command injection.

## poc

poc cannot be published according to Chinese laws.

## ID

CVE-2022-43184

CNVD-2022-68294
