Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `getTemplateContent` function within the `class-clever-widget-base.php` file of the Clever Addons for Elementor plugin. This function allows retrieval of content from Elementor templates.

- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `getTemplateContent` function does not have proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users with Contributor-level access or higher to retrieve content of any Elementor template, including private, pending, and draft templates.
