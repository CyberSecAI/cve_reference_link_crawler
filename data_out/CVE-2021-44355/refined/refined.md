{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` field of a JSON request is always a JSON object and attempts to access it using the subscription operator. When a non-object value is provided for param, such as an empty string, the program asserts and crashes leading to device reboot.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The cgiserver.cgi application does not validate the type of the 'param' field in JSON requests and assumes it is always an object.",
     "Denial of Service: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object value for the `param` field crashes the `cgiserver.cgi` process, causing a device reboot."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit leads to denial of service by causing the device to reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera. While some of the vulnerable APIs require authentication, it's noted that another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) can be used to bypass the authentication requirement."
