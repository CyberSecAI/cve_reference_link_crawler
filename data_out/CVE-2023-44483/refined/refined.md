- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the logging of private keys in debug logs when generating an XML Signature using the JSR 105 API in Apache Santuario.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (private keys) in debug logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disclosure of private keys, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security compromises.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the analysis of log files generated by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the log files where the private keys have been logged, and debug logging must be enabled.
