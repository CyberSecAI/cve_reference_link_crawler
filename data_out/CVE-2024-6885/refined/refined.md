Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient file path validation within the `maxi_remove_custom_image_size` and `maxi_add_custom_image_size` functions of the MaxiBlocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the file paths provided in the `$_POST['old_media_src']` parameter, allowing for path traversal attacks. Specifically, the `delete_old_file` function at line 66 uses `str_replace(get_site_url() . '/', '', $old_media)` which is insufficient to prevent traversal. It only removes the site URL but does not validate that the remaining path is within the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Authenticated attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `old_media_src` parameter in POST requests to the vulnerable functions. This could lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Deleting critical files, such as `wp-config.php`, could lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `wp_ajax_maxi_add_custom_image_size` and `wp_ajax_maxi_remove_custom_image_size` actions.
*   **Manipulation of `old_media_src` parameter:**  The attacker manipulates the `old_media_src` POST parameter to include a path to the file they want to delete.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber-level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

* The `delete_old_file` function at line 66 attempts to remove the site URL from the given path, but does not prevent path traversal attacks.
* The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 1.9.2 of the MaxiBlocks plugin.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 22, 2024.
* The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to version 1.9.3 or later.

The provided code snippets from the plugin source code show the vulnerable functions at:
*   `class-maxi-image-crop.php#L42` (`maxi_add_custom_image_size`)
*   `class-maxi-image-crop.php#L66` (`delete_old_file`)
*   `class-maxi-image-crop.php#L100` (`maxi_remove_custom_image_size`)
*   `plugin.php#L221` (where maxi_insert_block function is defined, though unrelated to this CVE.)
