Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs within the `mjs_op_json_parse()` function. This suggests a memory access violation during JSON parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The core issue lies within how the `mjs_op_json_parse()` function handles malformed or specifically crafted JSON input. The provided ASAN output indicates a read memory access violation at `mjs.c:11364`. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted json file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): The segmentation fault causes the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing crafted json file to the `mjs_op_json_parse()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specific crafted JSON file to the affected `mjs` application. This might occur through various means, depending on how the `mjs` application is deployed and used (e.g., file upload, API interaction).
