- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality within the web-based UI of the Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical functionality within the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the system by exploiting the lack of authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability through the web-based UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be network-adjacent to the affected DSE855 device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
