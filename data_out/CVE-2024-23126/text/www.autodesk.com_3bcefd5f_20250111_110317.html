### Recommendations

These CVEs impact the import feature in AutoCAD. Fixes for these vulnerabilities will be issued for affected versions in an upcoming release. Product users can take the following steps to mitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities:

* Avoid using the import feature
* Disable imports by renaming acTranslators.exe in the AutoCAD install folder. This disables imports of the following file-types: 3dm, abc, CATPart, iges, igs, model, prt, sldasm, sldprt, step, sstp, x\_t
* Import files from trusted sources only

Please refer to this advisory for additional updates to release information.

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/previous-version-support/bd-p/6051) for more information about previous version support.
