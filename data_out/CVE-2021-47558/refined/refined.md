The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47558.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to disable the transmit (Tx) queues when the network interface is stopped for reconfiguration in the `stmmac` driver. This lack of disabling can cause a kernel panic when performing certain actions that trigger a reconfiguration of the interface while packets are still being transmitted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `stmmac` driver does not properly disable Tx queues before reconfiguring the interface.
- This can cause a race condition and a memory access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A kernel panic leading to denial of service.
- Memory corruption may be possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Reconfiguring the number of queues (using `ethtool -L`).
- Reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (using `ethtool -G`).
- Installing/removing an XDP program (using `ip l set dev ethX xdp`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to reconfigure the network interface using the commands mentioned above, which would typically require root access or administrative privileges on the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `stmmac_main.c` file in the Linux kernel.
- The fix involves adding a call to `netif_tx_disable(dev)` before stopping the interface.
- The kernel panic that occurs due to the missing `netif_tx_disable` call involves a page fault.
