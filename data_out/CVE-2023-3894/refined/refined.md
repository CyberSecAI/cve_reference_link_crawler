Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability fix in the `jackson-dataformats-text` library:

**Vulnerability:** Stack overflow due to excessive nesting in TOML data. This vulnerability was discovered by OSS-Fuzz.

**Root Cause:** The TOML parser in `jackson-dataformats-text` did not have a limit on the nesting depth of TOML structures, which could lead to a stack overflow when processing deeply nested TOML input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of a limit on TOML structure depth.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A stack overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can provide a specially crafted TOML input with excessive nesting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to an application that uses the vulnerable library to parse TOML data.

**Additional Details:**
*   Pull Request #398 addresses the issue by adding a check for nesting depth.
*   The fix was merged into the 2.15 branch of the `jackson-dataformats-text` repository.
*   The fix initially included a check that was later considered unnecessary, as the parser itself should catch the issue. However, the fix was kept, possibly as an assertion for extra validation.
*   The pull request mentions that "TOML code has no ReadContext so I'm just tracking depth using an int". This indicates the depth tracking was implemented using a simple integer counter rather than using existing context in Jackson.
*   The discussion also mentions that the depth limit is critical for streaming as well, although there is no real streaming support for TOML format using this library.

This analysis is based on the provided GitHub pull request discussion and indicates a fix for a potential stack overflow vulnerability due to unbounded nesting in TOML parsing.
