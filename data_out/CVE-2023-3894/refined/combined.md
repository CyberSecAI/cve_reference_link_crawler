### **[yawkat](/yawkat)** commented [Mar 7, 2023](#issuecomment-1458068052)

| this seems like a better fix than [#395](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/pull/395). the only thing i'm concerned about is the difference of toml to the other formats. someone using only the streaming apis might set the max stream depth fairly high because they think they cannot run into the data binding issues it exists to avoid. however with toml, the depth limit is critical for streaming as well (since there is no real streaming for toml), not just for binding.  but this is probably not a realistic issue, so this still seems superior. |

| [@pjfanning](https://github.com/pjfanning) i dont think the nesting check is necessary? it should be caught by the parser, every start token will have a pollExpected with the corresponding end token |

| [@yawkat](https://github.com/yawkat) I'll probably remove the check. I just wanted to see if there were any existing tests where the depth misbehaves. I'll leave the check there for the moment but as I say, I'm likely to remove it before merging. |
