- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the `id` parameter in the `/php-lms/admin/?page=user/manage_user` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data exfiltration, data modification, or complete database compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerable parameter is `id` in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request containing malicious SQL code to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
