Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `login_process.php` file. Specifically, the `hr_email` and `hr_password` parameters received via POST are directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized input allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially altering its logic and gaining unauthorized database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive data within the database, such as customer information, personal details, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues and potential service disruption.
- **Complete Database Control:** In severe cases, an attacker might gain full control over the database server, allowing them to perform any administrative action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `initialize/login_process.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Input:** The attacker manipulates the `hr_email` and `hr_password` parameters within the POST request to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send the malicious POST requests.
- **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how HTTP requests work to be able to craft malicious POST requests containing the SQL injection payloads.
- No special privileges or access to the server are required before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is present in `initialize/login_process.php`.
- The SQL query constructed is:
```php
$query  = $phdb->query("SELECT * FROM hr_member WHERE hr_email='$hr_email' AND hr_password='$hr_password' AND hr_type='HR Head'");
```
- The provided SQLmap output shows the vulnerability is detectable with boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based SQL injection techniques.
- The vulnerable parameters are `hr_email` and `hr_password`.
