### Bug Description

Hi there

We want to share that the latest version (2022.0.0) of pto\_merge causes heap-buffer-overflow.

The invalid memory allocation may attribute to the excessive values in function parameters to the HuginBase::PanoramaMemento::loadPTScript.

Here is the output of program with address sanitizer attached.
