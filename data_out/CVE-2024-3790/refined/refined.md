Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-3790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `/admin/SystemUsers` section of WBSAirback version 21.02.04. Specifically, the login and description fields, as well as the `passwd1` and `passwd2` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable fields. When a user views the affected page, the injected scripts will execute in their browser context. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing session data, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
  - Data theft/manipulation: Gaining access to sensitive data or modifying information on the page.
  - Redirection: Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker would send a crafted URL containing malicious script to the victim via some method, likely using a link or other means to get the victim to access the admin interface.
- User Interaction: The victim needs to access the affected page where the malicious script is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted requests to the server to inject the malicious scripts into the vulnerable fields. 
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. However, the vulnerability requires that the victim is logged into the application.
- They would also need to entice a privileged user to visit a specific URL or otherwise interact with the manipulated data to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is part of a set of 16 vulnerabilities discovered in WBSAirback.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.8.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
