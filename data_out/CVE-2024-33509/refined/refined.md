- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation. The FortiWeb device does not properly validate certificates when establishing secure connections to fetch data for the Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of client-side certificate validation (CWE-295).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position can decipher and/or tamper with the communication between the FortiWeb device and its data endpoints. This could lead to information disclosure and/or manipulation of WAF data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, specifically through a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a MitM position within the network path of communication between the FortiWeb device and its endpoints. The attacker does not need authentication to perform the attack.
