**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Full Path Disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can discover the full path of the web application. This information is not useful on its own, but it can be used to aid other attacks by providing details about the system's configuration and potentially exposing sensitive directory paths.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.
- The attack can be carried out over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
