The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1323.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Discy theme lacks authorization checks when processing AJAX requests for the `discy_update_options` action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The theme does not properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to update the theme options.
- **Missing authorization:** Any logged-in user, even with the lowest privileges like 'Subscriber', can change theme settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A low-privileged attacker can modify the theme settings which could lead to a variety of issues such as:
- Defacement of the website.
- Injection of malicious scripts.
- Changing the website's functionality
- Potential for further privilege escalation by modifying settings which can affect site functionality

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `discy_update_options`, along with the new settings data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber role.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable `discy_update_options` AJAX action.
