```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) module when handling direct page faults with nested Translation Lookaside Buffer (TDP) MMU. The function `make_mmu_pages_available()` is called without holding the mmu_lock for write when TDP is in use, which can lead to a race condition because shadow pages might be zapped incorrectly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Race condition due to improper locking when calling `make_mmu_pages_available()` with nested TDP MMU enabled."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The race condition can lead to a kernel BUG and general protection fault in the host kernel. This can potentially lead to denial of service or other undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Repeatedly starting and stopping nested VMs.",
    "Artificially allocating a large number of nested TDP SPTEs."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to start nested VMs or control the allocation of nested TDP SPTEs.  This likely involves having some level of access to the host machine's virtualization capabilities."
