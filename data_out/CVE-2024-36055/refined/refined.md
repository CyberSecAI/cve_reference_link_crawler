The provided content relates to CVE-2024-36055.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `Hw64.sys` driver of Marvin Test HW.exe, specifically in versions prior to 5.0.5.0. The driver allows unprivileged user-mode processes to map physical memory with read/write access via the `MmMapIoSpace` API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   Improper access control, specifically allowing unprivileged user-mode processes to interact with kernel memory and physical memory mapping functions.
-   The vulnerability exists within the driver code, specifically when handling IOCTLs related to physical memory mapping.
-   The vulnerable driver allows arbitrary physical memory mapping with read/write access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Denial of service (BSOD - Blue Screen of Death) due to the ability to arbitrarily map physical memory with read/write access.
- Potential for further exploitation since memory mapping can be used as a primitive for more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Local attack vector.
-   The attacker exploits the vulnerability through sending specific IOCTLs to the vulnerable driver `Hw64.sys`.
-   Unprivileged user-mode processes can trigger the vulnerability by sending specific IOCTLs to the driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target machine.
-   The attacker does not need elevated privileges initially, as the vulnerability can be triggered from an unprivileged user-mode process.
