- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TIA Administrator creates temporary download files in a directory with insecure permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure permissions on the directory where temporary files are created, specifically allowing write access for non-administrative users. This is identified as CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker on the Windows system can disrupt the update process. This results in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the Windows system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated on the Windows system where the TIA Administrator is running.
