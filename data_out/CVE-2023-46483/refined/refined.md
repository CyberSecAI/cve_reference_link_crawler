- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new "Zone" in the advanced features, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will be executed when other users view the affected content. This could lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious payload (`<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) into the "Zone" creation form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid account and be authenticated to the system to access the "advanced features" and create a new "Zone". The default credentials "admin/admin" allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
