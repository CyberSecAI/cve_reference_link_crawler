- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'available-days-tf' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious script in the 'available-days-tf' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious payload, indicating no special access or privileges are needed.
