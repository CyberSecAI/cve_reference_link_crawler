## Architected for scale

Built with modern distributed systems principles to grow with your applications and infrastructure. No artificial limits or barriers, just true horizontal scalability.

![Architected for scale]( "Architected for scale")![Architected for scale](/products/assets/ges/scale-diagram.svg "Architected for scale")

Architected for scale

* Achieve maximum potential observability since metric and log limits are no longer a barrier.
* Save money by not supporting the overhead of a monitoring infrastructure, both in resources and people time.
* Easily store application and infrastructure data in one centralized cluster, or across multiple clusters without needing a dedicated team.
## Simple, organization-wide administration and security

Confidently democratize data across your entire company with advanced admin tools to govern, audit, and secure user permissions and data.

![Simple, organization-wide administration & security](/media/products/assets/ges/security-diagram.svg)
##### Simple to manage

Not everyone needs access to the same data. Create flexible, secure views of relevant data for each team to optimize self-service, without additional overhead.

##### Simple to synchronize

Centralized authentication allows you to seamlessly integrate with your existing LDAP/Active Directory platform to allow a single point of control.

##### Simple to customize

Best-in-class query performance means you can quickly create real-time dashboards that can be shared throughout your organization.

##### Simple to secure

Export detailed user event logs to a file or to Enterprise Logs, in order to track and prevent suspicious activity.

## Services and support

Personalized training to help you maximize your usage of Grafana, Graphite, Prometheus, and Loki, led by the experts. Grafana Labs will help your teams establish best practices in instrumentation and deployment, as well as be an on-demand resource for ongoing questions.

#### Observability is our thing

45% of all **Prometheus** team members

89% of the **Grafana** team members, including project founders

91% of the **Loki** team members, including project founders

100% of all **Tempo** maintainers, including project founders

![Services and support]( "Services and support")![Services and support](/media/products/assets/ges/grafana-crew.jpg "Services and support")
#### Turn your team into experts

* Engineering-led learning to help your teams uplevel their skills and observability strategy
* Roadmap assurance and the opportunity to work with us to accelerate new features and functionality and shape the future of Grafana Enterprise
* Best practices embedded throughout various engagements and tools

## Correlate your data

Understanding all relevant data â and the relationships between them â is important. The Grafana Enterprise Stack allows teams to seamlessly correlate insights among metrics and logs.

![A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.]( "A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.")![A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.](/media/products/assets/ges/correlate-dashboard.jpg "A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.")

A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.

* Easily correlate data to get to the root cause faster.
* Reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR) and de-risk feature launches.
