Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28147:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2021-28147 and describes a vulnerability related to access control bypass in Grafana Enterprise. This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a mechanism introduced in Grafana Enterprise 6.1.0 that allows any authenticated user to add external groups to existing teams, but only when the `editorsCanAdmin` feature is enabled.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an access control bypass, where an authenticated user can elevate privileges by adding external groups to teams without proper authorization.
*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The system fails to properly validate whether a user is authorized to modify team membership, leading to the vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can add themselves or other users to teams they are not authorized to be part of.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** By gaining team membership, the attacker gains access to dashboards and data sources associated with that team.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP API:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP API.
*   **External Authentication Service:**  The attack vector requires the Grafana instance to be using an external authentication service and to have the editorsCanAdmin feature enabled.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the Grafana Enterprise instance.
*   **Knowledge of Team IDs:** The attacker must have the team ID of a target team in Grafana.
*   **`editorsCanAdmin` Feature Enabled:** The vulnerability is only exploitable if the Grafana instance has the `editorsCanAdmin` feature enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Grafana Enterprise and does not affect Grafana OSS.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during an internal security audit.
*   Patches are available in Grafana versions 6.x, 7.3.x, and 7.4.x.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the `editorsCanAdmin` feature on versions prior to 7.4.0 and avoiding use of teams on 7.4.x versions, if upgrading is not an option.
