Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36672:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from `tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com` directly references CVE-2023-36672 and provides detailed information about the "LocalNet attack" which is associated with this CVE. This content is highly relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the insecure handling of routing exceptions by VPN clients. Specifically, VPN clients often allow traffic to local networks to bypass the VPN tunnel. This is done to enable local network functionality like printing or screen sharing while using the VPN.
   - The vulnerability arises when a malicious network advertises public IP ranges as part of the local network. The VPN client, trusting this information, sends traffic intended for those public IPs outside the VPN tunnel, leading to exposure.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insecure Local Network Handling:** VPN clients allow traffic to local networks to bypass the tunnel based on potentially attacker-controlled routing information.
   - **Trust of Unverified Network Information:** VPN clients do not always verify if IP ranges advertised as local are actually private.
   - **Lack of API usage on iOS**: Some VPN vendors don't use the includeAllNetworks API due to reported reliability issues.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Traffic Leakage:** Attackers can intercept traffic intended for websites or internet services by having it bypass the VPN tunnel. This can lead to the leakage of usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information.
   - **Traffic Blocking (Denial of Service):** The vulnerability can also be used to selectively block traffic to certain IP ranges, potentially disrupting security updates or access to security cameras.
   - **Exposure of Browsing Activity:** Even when HTTPS is used, the attack can reveal which websites a user is visiting.
   - **Attack against Insecure Protocols:** Older, unencrypted protocols (RDP, POP, FTP, Telnet) become vulnerable because the VPN no longer protects them.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious Wi-Fi/Ethernet Network:** The attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot or Ethernet network and convinces the victim to connect to it.
   - **Spoofed Network Information:** The malicious network advertises public IP ranges as being within the local network using techniques like DHCP.
   - **Manipulation of Routing Tables:** The attacker manipulates the victim's routing table so that traffic intended for the public IPs are routed outside the VPN tunnel.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the victim to create a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot or have control over the local network.
   - **Network Configuration Control:** The attacker needs the ability to configure the malicious network to assign IP addresses and manipulate routing information, such as advertising public IP addresses as part of the local network.
   - **No special privileges needed on the victim's device.**

**Additional Notes:**
- The content highlights that all VPN apps on iOS are vulnerable, while Android apps are generally the most secure, with 25% being vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is platform-dependent and also dependent on how local network sharing settings are configured.
- The content provides recommendations to mitigate the attack, such as disabling local network access in the VPN client.
- It is also mentioned that the server-side of the connection could be a malicious server, and that the VPN client does not protect against MitM attacks between client and server, but that is not the primary focus of this CVE.
