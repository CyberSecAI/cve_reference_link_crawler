## Security Advisories​

# Security Advisories​

## Name

## Description

[CVE-2024-7746](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-7746/)

Use of Default Credentials vulnerability in Tananaev Solutions Traccar Server on Administrator Panel modules allows Authentication Abuse.

This issue affects the privileged transactions implemented by the Traccar solution that should otherwise be protected by the authentication mechanism.

These transactions could have an impact on any sensitive aspect of the platform, including Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

[CVE-2024-6564](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-6564-buffer-overflow-in-rensas-rcar/)

Buffer overflow in “rcar\_dev\_init” due to using due to using untrusted data (rcar\_image\_number) as a loop counter before verifying it against RCAR\_MAX\_BL3X\_IMAGE. This could lead to a full bypass of secure boot.

[CVE-2024-6563](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-6563/)

Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’) vulnerability in Renesas arm-trusted-firmware allows Local Execution of Code.

This vulnerability is associated with program files [https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar\_gen3\_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/i...](https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar_gen3_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/io_rcar.C).

In line 313 “addr\_loaded\_cnt” is checked not to be “CHECK\_IMAGE\_AREA\_CNT” (5) or larger, this check does not halt the function. Immediately after (line 317) there will be an overflow in the buffer and the value of “dst” will be written to the area immediately after the buffer, which is “addr\_loaded\_cnt”. This will allow an attacker to freely control the value of “addr\_loaded\_cnt” and thus control the destination of the write immediately after (line 318). The write in line 318 will then be fully controlled by said attacker, with whichever address and whichever value (“len”) they desire.

[CVE-2024-6287](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-6287-incorrect-address-range-calculations-in-renesas-rcar/)

Incorrect Calculation vulnerability in Renesas arm-trusted-firmware allows Local Execution of Code.

When checking whether a new image invades/overlaps with a previously loaded image the code neglects to consider a few cases. that could an attacker to bypass memory range restriction and overwrite an already loaded image partly or completely, which could result in code execution and bypass of secure boot.

[CVE-2024-6285](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-6285-integer-underflow-in-memory-range-check-in-renesas-rcar/)

# **Integer Underflow in Memory Range Check**

## **Location**

* Filename = drivers\renesas\common\io\io\_rcar.c
  + Function = check\_load\_area

* Line=271
* Line=283

## **Description**

The function “check\_load\_area” is responsible for ensuring that an image loading operation won’t affect certain memory ranges. It does this by receiving a destination (start address) and length parameters, calculating start and end addresses from them, and comparing them against certain memory ranges. More specifically, it does this by calculating that the start address is not bigger than the end of the allowed range minus the length: “dst > dram\_end – len”. But it fails to address the situation in which the length is bigger than the end of the allowed range. In such case, an underflow to a very large value would occur (since the variable is of type uint) and the check could pass even though it should fail.

The only limitation on the length parameter is that it’s not bigger than the “image\_max\_size” variable, which for the linux image for example, is very large (0xFFFB000000, but because of casting into a uint32 variable is maximized at uint32\_max) and enough to underflow the 2 upper limits checked: “prot\_end” = 0x47E00000, “dram\_end” = 0xC0000000.

The only limitations on the destination (start address) parameter are that it’s after the dram\_start (0x40000000) and not in SDRAM protected area (can start 1 byte before and overwrite into).

### **Preconditions**

The ability to write to the flash area used by the bootloader.

### **Threat**

An attacker can bypass the memory range restriction and write data to an arbitrary memory address, which could result in bypass of secure boot.

### **Recommendations**

Add underflow checks for calculations.

### **Attack Rating**

Expertise: Expert

Access: Moderate

Time: Days

Equipment: Specialized

Knowledge: Public

CWE: 191

Affected Technology: program code execution

Affected Security Goal: ECU integrity

[CVE-2024-5684](https://asrg.io/security-advisories/vulnerability-in-id-charger-connect-and-pro-from-volkswagen-group-charging-gmbh-elli-evbox-versions-spr3-2b-spr3-51-and-spr3-52/)

PCAutomotive team has identified a vulnerability that allows an attacker having access to the private network to which the charger is connected, or with local access to the Ethernet interface, to bypass password authentication in the web configuration interface of ID Charger Connect and Pro versions SPR3.2B, SPR3.51 and SPR3.52 due to a faulty implementation of the JWT library. In this level of access, an attacker can:

• Enable and disable Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and LTE interfaces of the charger.

• Initiate a factory reset causing a short-term denial-of-service of the charger, settings reset and disconnect from the owner’s Wi-Fi network.

• Enumerate available Wi-Fi networks SSIDs at charger’s location.

• Obtain system information, such as components serial numbers, software versions, mac addresses of charger interfaces, etc.

• Manage user preferences
