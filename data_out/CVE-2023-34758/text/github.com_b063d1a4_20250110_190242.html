‚ö†Ô∏è Backwards incompatible changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

This release fixes a vulnerability ([CVE-2023-34758](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q "CVE-2023-34758")) in the Sliver Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), where improper use of Nacl Box (libsodium) could allow a MitM attacker with a copy of the implant binary to recover the session key and arbitrarily encrypt/decrypt C2 messages. Note that the Sliver KEM is only used over *insecure protocols* such as HTTP and DNS, and does not affect mTLS or Wireguard.

The issue was addressed by switching to a combination [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for the KEM and HMAC-SHA2-256 to verify the implant.

More details: [GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/security/advisories/GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q "GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q")

Special thanks to [Ting-Wei Hsieh](https://github.com/tangent65536) from [CHT Security Co. Ltd.](https://www.chtsecurity.com/?lang=en) for reporting the vulnerability.
