# Slivjacker

### Hijack Sliver Implants Via MitM Attacks (CVE-2023-34758)

By Tangent65536 at CHT Security Co., Ltd.

---

### Special thanks to the [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) devs for swift responses and update! It's a really powerful and awesome tool!

---

# Intro

According to the [Sliver documentation](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Transport-Encryption#known-limitations), the framework is supposed to accomplish (partial) forward secrecy:

> Perfect Forward Secrecy: We do get some forward secrecy, since only the public key encrypted version of the session key is sent over the wire; therefore **recovery of the hard coded implant keys from the binary should not result in recovery of the session key. Only when the server's private key is compromised can the session key be recovered**, which we currently don't consider to be a problem.

Nevertheless, the vulnerable implementation of the Sliver ECDH key exchange scheme did not provide any extra level of security as a man in the middle with access to a Sliver implant binary listening to the implant's traffic can reliably recover the session key, resulting in full disclosure of all transmitted data. Furthermore, the MitM can fully compromise the connection to execute arbitrary commands supported by the corresponding implant on its installed devices.

## Expected Behavior

Based on the official documentation, a man in the middle (MitM) without access to the server's private key should not be able to decrypt the transmitted data; and any changes made to the data stream should be noticed.

## Actual Behavior

A MitM with access only to an implant executable can fully compromise the corresponding implant's network traffic, including 1. decrypting and eavesdropping on the underlying data transmission, and 2. taking over the control of the implant to execute arbitrary tasks.

---

# Details

## ECDH Key Exchange 101

*If you don't want to read my poorly written piece of utter nonsense, check out Prof. Mike Pound's awesome video diving into the juicy details here! [Elliptic Curves - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF1pwjL9-DE)* ^.^

Suppose we have two parties who want to establish a secure communication channel. The abstract idea of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is that each party generates a pair of public and private keys based on some (publicly) known contexts, and by sending the public component to each other, each party can derive the same shared secret with their own private components and the received public components. The shared secret is then used to deterministically generate a symmetric key used to encrypt transmitted data.

More technically, using the ECDH as an example, the (misleadingly simplified) mathematic operation performed here is the [elliptic curve point multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication). The operator, which we here simply denote as `**`, takes a point `P` on a given curve `[C]`, and a scalar `n`, to produce another point `Q` on the same curve `[C]`; and we write it as `Q = P ** n`. Please takes it as the definition here that it is always `a point ** a scalar` (you can find more details on the Wikipedia page if you're interested in the underlying math). Also, just remember that while calculating `Q = P ** n` from `P` and `n` is trivial, recovering `n` that satisfies `Q = P ** n` from two given points `P` and `Q` is extremely difficult. (That being said, there are LOTS OF catches. Here, we consider them out of scope. Presumably, one can rely on cryptographic experts to figure out issues within well-maintained public libraries like OpenSSL.)

The other theorem crucial to understanding this puzzle is that given two integers `m` and `n`, `(P ** m) ** n` equals `(P ** n) ** m`. Furthermore, it's also the same as what `P ** (m * n)` lands on, where `m * n` is the simple integer multiplication you learned in primary school.

With proper care taken to determine what `m` and `n` are, we can now use them to do the magic tricks we'd like to perform. Suppose that both Alice and Bob agree to use the curve `[C]` and a public base point `G` in the first place. Alice generates a random number `m`, and Bob does something similar independently to get `n`. Now, Alice performs the operation `G ** m` that gives her the point `M = G ** m`; Bob also uses the same point `G` but multiplies it by his number `n` and gets the point `N = G ** n`. Later, Alice and Bob exchange their calculated points `M` and `N` with each other. After that, Alice calculates `N ** m` and Bob computes `M ** n`. Ta-da! Both Alice and Bob get the same point `G ** (m * n)`! This is the point where they reach a shared secret!

Imagine if another person, Eve, is hiding under the radar and keeping track of everything transmitted between Alice and Bob. Now she can read out both the exchanged points `M` and `N`. Unfortunately for her, since it is difficult to recover either `m` or `n` from those two points, she cannot calculate the shared secret `G ** (m * n)` that Alice and Bob have landed on. This is the core concept of the (EC)DH key exchange scheme, that two parties can establish a shared secret between each other without leaking it to the public.

## What Exactly Went Wrong?

Unfortunately, things can easily get messed up when extra bits of security are required, such as forward secrecy. By design, the Sliver framework does not satisfy [its definition (from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy):

> In cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised.

Also on the same Wikipedia page, it reads:

> For HTTPS, the long-term secret is typically the private key of the server.

Assuming that all public keys last eternally (as they can be captured by listening to the network traffic), recovery of **any** private key(s) used in the shared secret derivation **will** result in full disclosure of session keys. (And yes, this is how the "[harvest now, decrypt later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now%2C_decrypt_later)" strategy would work!) As the documentation correctly identifies this as a limitation, we'd argue the recovery of server private keys is not an issue.

The problem here arose from using the same, hard-coded key pairs in both the server and the implant binaries to derive a shared secret.

During the ECDH key exchange between the implant and the server, the same shared secret can be derived in the following operations:

> **Option A**: Use the private key from the server (`s`) and the public key from the implant (`C`) to calculate the shared secret `R`. (`R = C ** s`). This is what the server uses.
>
> **Option B**: Use the public key from the server (`S`) and the private key from the implant (`c`) to calculate the shared secret `R`. (`R = S ** c`). This is what the implant uses.

Since both `S` and `c` are statically embedded in a vulnerable implant, one can recover the shared secret by simply reverse engineering the compiled implant executable. (Basically "replay" what the implant would do to compute the shared secret!)

Furthermore, as the vulnerable implant does not validate the authenticity, a MitM who recovered the shared secret (hence granted access to the session key) can produce valid encrypted data streams to control the behavior of the corresponding implant's installations.

## Detailed Walkthrough

As we have already learned that the shared secret can be retrieved simply by extracting the embedded server public key and implant key in the binary, all we have to do now are to spoof as the C2 and to send our own tasks to the hijacked implant. We don't need to worry about all those embedded signature keys either, since the implant relies merely on the session key supposedly only known to the server and itself.

Below is a brief list of instructions we have to perform:

1. Read the first `POST` request sent from the implant beacon that attempts to perform a key exchange. We simply take the IV in the message and decrypt the session key. Store the key as it will be the master key to the following transfers.
2. Take the master key and encrypt a random buffer as its "session ID". Send the encrypted and encoded buffer back to the implant.
3. Ignores the next two `POST` requests. Those two messages contain the installation info which we don't need. However, keep in mind that if these two messages did not show up, it would imply that our reply containing the "session ID" was not recognized by the implant and would have to wait for the next check-in.
4. The following `GET` request sent from the implant should have the file extension `.js` (indicating it's a poll message looking for tasks to execute). Send our `protobuf` serialized payload back as the reply in this step.
5. The next `POST` request should contain the execution results. If this message is not received immediately after dispatching the payload, it may mean that our payload is malformed. One would have to wait until the next check-in should this happen.

## Proof of Concept

The PoC is written in Node.js (`v12.22.12`+) and only works on HTTP(S) implants. The following items/presets are required:

1. A copy of the implant executable file with its private key and the server's public key retrieved and added to `conf.json`. The corresponding server's private key is NOT needed!
2. Make sure your implant's C2 points to the PoC server's address to mimic a MitM.
3. Currently, only the Windows implants with the default config have been tested.
4. An implant with the version 1.5.x which implements the new ECDH key exchange scheme is required. This PoC does not work with the older 1.4.x protocol.

[![Img. 1](/tangent65536/Slivjacker/raw/main/demo/img01.png)](/tangent65536/Slivjacker/blob/main/demo/img01.png)

By default, the PoC server prints all the received data on the console screen. You should see your designated payload popping up on the implanted device instantly right after the beacon starts.

Also, if you somehow cannot generate your own vulnerable implant binary to test on, there's a sample (host: `hxxps://192.168.211[.]129:443`) under the `demo` folder. The default `conf.json` has the settings already filled in targeting this binary. The password is the standard one commonly used in malware analysis.

# CHT Security Blue Team Discovered a MitM Command Injection Vulnerability in an Open-Source Red-Team Penetration Testing Framework (CVE-2023-34758)

**CVSSv3.0**：8.1/10

**Affected Versions**: >= 1.5.0, < 1.5.40

**Abstract**:
   A flaw was discovered in the cryptographic key-exchange protocol in a C2 framework up to version 1.5.39. The weakness allows a MitM with access to an implant binary to hijack connections between the corresponding implant and its C2 server, and to subsequently execute arbitrary code on the implanted device.

**Details**:
   The flawed ECDH key-exchange protocol implementation in a C2 uses static private and public keys embedded in the implant executable to derive a shared secret. This gives the attacker with access to an implant executable ability to derive the corresponding shared secret used by the open-source red-team penetration testing framework to establish secure connections. A man-in-the-middle can exploit the weakness to retrieve encryption keys form the corresponding implant’s traffic and forge valid encrypted data streams, granting the attacker ability to execute arbitrary code on the implanted device.

**Mitigation**:
 Update the framework to 1.5.40 or newer versions.

⚠️ Backwards incompatible changes ⚠️

This release fixes a vulnerability ([CVE-2023-34758](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q "CVE-2023-34758")) in the Sliver Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), where improper use of Nacl Box (libsodium) could allow a MitM attacker with a copy of the implant binary to recover the session key and arbitrarily encrypt/decrypt C2 messages. Note that the Sliver KEM is only used over *insecure protocols* such as HTTP and DNS, and does not affect mTLS or Wireguard.

The issue was addressed by switching to a combination [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for the KEM and HMAC-SHA2-256 to verify the implant.

More details: [GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/security/advisories/GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q "GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q")

Special thanks to [Ting-Wei Hsieh](https://github.com/tangent65536) from [CHT Security Co. Ltd.](https://www.chtsecurity.com/?lang=en) for reporting the vulnerability.

## Affected versions

>= 1.5.0, < 1.5.40

## Patched versions

1.5.40

## Description

### Summary

The current cryptography implementation in Sliver up to version 1.5.39 allows a MitM with access to the corresponding implant binary to execute arbitrary codes on implanted devices via intercepted and crafted responses. (Reserved CVE ID: [CVE-2023-34758](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8jxm-xp43-qh3q "CVE-2023-34758"))

### Details

Please see [the PoC repo](https://github.com/tangent65536/Slivjacker).

### PoC

Please also see [the PoC repo](https://github.com/tangent65536/Slivjacker).

To setup a simple PoC environment,

1. Generate an implant with its C2 set to the PoC server's address and copy the embedded private implant key and public server key into the config json.
2. Run the implant on a separate VM and a `notepad.exe` window should pop up on the implanted VM.

### Impact

A successful attack grants the attacker permission to execute arbitrary code on the implanted device.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email).
