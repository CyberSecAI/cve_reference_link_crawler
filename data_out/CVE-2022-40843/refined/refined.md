Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-40843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper authorization and session management within the Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 router's web interface. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate user sessions and authorization checks when a user tries to access a resource or perform an action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-287 / CWE-285 / CWE-288):** The system does not correctly perform authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated access to resources.
*   **Improper Session Management:** The router doesn't properly manage user sessions, leading to bypass of the login page.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** Cookies like `bLanguage`, `_:USERNAME:_` are not required for session management, and `W15Ev2_user=` can be left blank. The presence of the `W15Ev2_user=` cookie acts as the primary (and flawed) authorization mechanism, which is easily bypassable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can access the `/syslog.log` file, which contains the MD5 hash of the administrator's password.
*   **Full Router Access:** The exposed password allows an attacker to gain full control of the router.
*   **Network Compromise:** With access to the router, attackers can perform internal network scans, obtain the Wi-Fi PSK, configure port forwarding, and potentially perform other attacks.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability exists both locally and remotely when the "Remote Web Management" is enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** By sending a GET request to `/goform/downloadSyslog/syslog.log` with a cookie set to `W15Ev2_user=`, an attacker bypasses authentication and gains access to the syslog.
*   **Remote Access:** When "Remote Web Management" is enabled, the vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a public `cloud.tendacn.net` subdomain, exposing the device to attacks from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface (either local or remote).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability, as it bypasses authorization checks.
*   **Remote Management enabled:** For remote exploitation, the router's "Remote Web Management" feature must be enabled, which exposes the device through a public ngrok tunnel.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present out-of-the-box locally, without any configuration changes by the user.
*   The blog post provides a detailed explanation of how the lack of proper session token generation and authentication level checks contributes to the vulnerability.
*   The blog post indicates that the `authSecurityHandler` function in the `httpd` binary is the cause for this vulnerability.
*   The blog post also indicates that approximately 18 devices were found using Google dorking configured with the cloud gateway.
