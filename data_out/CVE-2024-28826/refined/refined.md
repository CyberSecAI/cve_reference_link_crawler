- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `check_sftp` script in Checkmk did not restrict local file paths for uploads and downloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of path restrictions allowed users with `check_sftp` configuration permissions to read and write arbitrary files within the Checkmk site home directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could read or write sensitive files within the Checkmk site, leading to potential information disclosure or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** By configuring `check_sftp` with arbitrary local paths, an attacker could read or write any file within the Checkmk site home.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the permissions to configure `check_sftp`.
