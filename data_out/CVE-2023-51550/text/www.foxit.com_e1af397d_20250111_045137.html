**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers. | * Jörn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents. | * Jörn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users. | * Jörn Henkel * Haifei Li of EXPMON |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation. (CVE-2024-12751, CVE-2024-12752, CVE-2024-49576, CVE-2024-47810) | * Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * KPC of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a DLL Hijacking vulnerability, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs as the application fails to specify the secure search path when loading edputil.dll. | * Kim Dong Yeop (kdy) |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to the lack of proper validation when performing an update or installing a plugin. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM by loading malicious DLLs, calling an outdated version of the updater, or creating a junction to write an arbitrary file with full privileges. (CVE-2024-12753) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Sascha Meyer from GAI NetConsult GmbH |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability during the deactivation or uninstallation if the application is reinstalled without prior uninstallation, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs due to the inadequate permission setting for the “/usr/local/share/foxit” folder used during the installation so that low-privilege attackers can easily tamper with the script files in the directory. | * Tomas Kabrt |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, or fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript. (CVE-2024-28888, CVE-2024-7725, CVE-2024-9254) | * KPC of Cisco Talos * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability and crash when playing multimedia in certain PDF files, which attackers could exploit to launch a denial of service. This occurs due to the use of null pointer without proper validation as the application fails to properly handle the situation where the canvas is set as zero in width and length or the “/S” dictionary entry for the rendition object has been modified. | * Milan Kyselica |

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free or Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability and crash, which could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code. This occurs due to the GDI memory overflow as the application fails to properly handle the user inputs. | * Suyue Guo, Wei You from Renmin University of China |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Arbitrary File Execution vulnerability when opening certain PDF files that include the *OpenAction* method using the relative path with path spoofing techniques, which could be exploited by attackers to deceive users to execute commands to spread malicious code. The application has optimized the Launch File process, including getting the absolute path, restricting the execution of files whose file path exceeds 260 characters, and enlarging the window to display the full path (within 260 characters) of the file to be executed. | * Anonymous researcher |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Type Confusion vulnerability and crash when handling certain Annotation objects, which could be exploited by attackers to execute remote code. This occurs due to the access of illegal memory as the application casts the pointers of different types without inheritance relation and uses them without proper validation. (CVE-2023-51560) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Stack-Based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the use of abnormal data without proper validation when handling an XFA file that contains improper attribute values in the node of a widget. (CVE-2022-24954) | * DoHyun Lee(@l33d0hyun) and JaeHyuk Lim * DoHyun Lee(@l33d0hyun) |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Out-of-Bounds Read, Heap Overflow, Memory Corruption, Null Pointer Dereference, or Stack Buffer Overflow vulnerability and crash when converting certain PDF files to Office files. This occurs as the application reads data outside the bounds, accesses the memory that is modified invalidly, uses the null pointer, or reads or writes the data beyond the stack buffer. (CVE -2021-40729, CVE-2021-44709, ZS-VR-21-106, ZS-VR-21-107, ZS-VR-21-108, ZS-VR-21-109, CVE-2021-44740, CVE-2021-44741, CVE-2021-44708, ZS-VR-21-116) | * Kai Lu of Zscaler's ThreatLabz |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Memory Leak or Out-of-Bounds Read/Write vulnerability and crash. This occurs as the V8 JavaScript Engine does not take into account that the value of a variable type can be changed to “NaN” through addition or subtraction of Infinities, and fails to properly check and handle the abnormal data while handling the JavaScript. | * Dongjun shin(@\_\_sindo) |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Null Pointer Dereference or Array Out-of-Bounds vulnerability and crash when parsing certain PDF files. This occurs due to the use of null pointer or invalid object without proper validation. (CVE-2022-25108) | * DoHyun Lee(@l33d0hyun) and SeungJu Oh(@real\_as3617) |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Uncontrolled Search Path Element Privilege Escalation vulnerability, which could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious DLL files. This occurs as the application does not specify an absolute path when searching the DLL library. (CVE-2022-24955) | * DoHyun Lee(@l33d0hyun) |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Information Disclosure vulnerability when processing the format specifiers. This occurs as the *util.printf* function fails to handle the %llx format string properly. | * Trifescu Stefan-Octavian |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free or Out-of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash when deleting pages in certain PDF files using the JavaScript API. This occurs due to the use of freed object or read of data beyond the boundaries as the application incorrectly deletes the page view even though the PDF engine has not successfully deleted the page. (CVE-2022-24359, CVE-2022-24358) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash when handling certain Annotation objects, Doc objects or Acroforms.

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Out-of-Bounds Read/Write Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash when parsing certain JPEG2000 or JP2 files with relatively large values in their attributes. This is caused by the memory access violation due to the incorrectly-calculated value as an overflow occurs when calculating the memory size or buffer size to be allocated. (CVE-2022-24361, CVE-2022-24971, CVE-2022-24369, CVE-2022-24907, CVE-2022-24908) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Read Access Violation vulnerability and crash when parsing certain U3D files. This occurs due to the use of invalid pointer without proper validation. | * Milan Kyselica |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Read Access Violation vulnerability and crash when parsing certain PDF files. This occurs as the application gets the null dictionary object since the EFF information getting from the PDF file does not match the actual dictionary name, and uses the null dictionary object without proper validation. | * Milan Kyselica |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Memory Corruption vulnerability and crash when handling certain methods in JavaScript. This is caused by the array out-of-bounds error due to the lack of proper validation for the parameter in the method. (CVE-2022-22150) | * Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed an issue where the application could be exposed to various attacks if the XML configuration file of the iManage 10 plugin's logging function was modified. (CVE-2018-1285) |  |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript, LauchURL actions and Links to execute binary files/programs without prompting user for consent. (CVE-2018-19418/CVE-2018-19445/CVE-2018-19450/ CVE-2018-19451). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Illegally Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript and exportAsFDF to write any type of files to any location without the user's consent (CVE-2018-19446/ CVE-2018-19449). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to string1 URI Parsing Stack Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to lack of a maximum length limit for the URL where a long URL string will cause stack overflow when parsing (CVE-2018-19447). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs when a javascript command is triggered by a mouse enter action or a focus lost which deletes the current annotation, and causes it to reference the released memory (CVE-2018-19452/ CVE-2018-19444). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Uninitialized Object Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to the fact that the timer does not end when the form loses focus, which causes subsequent code to reference uninitialized objects (CVE-2018-19448). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
