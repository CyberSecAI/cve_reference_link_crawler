The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's mISDN driver, specifically in the `dsp_pipeline_build()` function. This vulnerability is addressed by the commits included in the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `dsp_pipeline_build()` function allocates memory using `kstrdup(cfg)` and stores the pointer in the `dup` variable.
- It then uses `strsep(&dup, "|")` to tokenize the duplicated string. This modifies `dup` to point to the next token in the string and after the last token the pointer becomes NULL.
- Subsequently, the function calls `kfree(dup)`, which attempts to free the memory at the location pointed to by `dup`. Because dup is NULL, it will result in trying to free a null pointer instead of the initially allocated buffer, leading to a memory leak as the allocated memory is not properly freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak due to incorrect use of `strsep` and `kfree`. The allocated buffer is not freed when the function completes, causing a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeatedly calling `dsp_pipeline_build()` with a suitable configuration string will lead to memory exhaustion and could crash the system or cause instability due to the memory leak.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `dsp_pipeline_build()` function is called by other parts of the mISDN driver. Any user with the ability to configure the mISDN driver could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to configure the mISDN driver and call the vulnerable function to trigger the memory leak. This could involve administrative privileges or access to specific system configuration interfaces depending on the specific setup.

**Fix:**
The fix involves introducing a new variable `next` to preserve the original pointer returned by `kstrdup`. The `strsep` function is then used on `next`, and the original allocated memory pointed to by `dup` is correctly freed when the function completes.
