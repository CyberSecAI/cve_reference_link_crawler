Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3510:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Java deserialization issue in Oracle WebLogic Server's `weblogic.corba.utils.MarshallObject` class. This class was not properly filtered, allowing attackers to bypass existing blacklist protections.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability lies in the way WebLogic handles deserialization within its CORBA implementation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the affected server. This could lead to full compromise of the server and the sensitive data hosted on it, and further propagation into the internal network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting a vulnerability in the HTTP protocol. Attackers can send a malicious serialized object over the network to the vulnerable server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the vulnerable WebLogic server. They do not need prior authentication credentials and can achieve RCE remotely.

**Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerability was discovered by Tenable researchers while testing a prior vulnerability fix in WebLogic. They found that the class filter blacklist had not changed.
*   Tenable researchers identified and tested `weblogic.corba.utils.MarshallObject`, which had been published as a bypass.
*   The Tenable advisory mentions that they were able to demonstrate RCE by popping `calc.exe` on a patched WebLogic Server 12.1.3 and provided the exploit to Oracle.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to its severity.

**Affected Products:**
*   Oracle WebLogic Server versions 10.3.6.0, 12.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.0.

**Mitigation:**

*   Oracle released a patch as part of the July 2016 Critical Patch Update (CPU). It is strongly advised to apply the relevant patches as soon as possible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Tenable advisory includes a detailed timeline of the vulnerability's discovery, reporting, and patching process.
*   The advisory also includes the CVSSv2 score and vector.
*   The Oracle advisory refers to the relevant patch information in Appendix FMW of the July 2016 CPU.
