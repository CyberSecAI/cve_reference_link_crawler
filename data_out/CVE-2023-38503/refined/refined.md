Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-38503:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission checking when using GraphQL subscriptions in Directus. The permission filters, which rely on `$CURRENT_USER` for filtering data access, are not properly enforced during GraphQL subscriptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The core issue is that permissions are not being properly checked in the context of GraphQL subscriptions. This results in unauthorized users receiving data they shouldn't have access to based on the defined permission filters.
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive data is being exposed to unauthorized users due to the flawed permission checks.
- **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** This CWE is explicitly identified as the weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can potentially gain access to information they are not authorized to see. This includes being able to get real-time updates for data they do not have permissions to view.
- **Confidentiality Violation:** The confidentiality of the application is compromised as unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data. In the provided example, updates for other users can be observed using the GraphQL subscription feature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GraphQL Subscriptions:** The vulnerability can be triggered by exploiting the GraphQL subscription functionality.
- **Network:** The attack vector is identified as "Network," meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability, meaning they are a user with some level of authorized access to the system.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required. This is related to the initial subscription made.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue involves how Directus handles permissions when using GraphQL subscriptions. Permission filters such as `user_created IS $CURRENT_USER` are not correctly evaluated, bypassing the intended access restrictions.
- The `directus_users` collection was identified as being vulnerable "out-of-the-box" due to the use of such permission filters.
- The provided example GraphQL query shows how an attacker can subscribe to changes on the `directus_users` collection and receive updates on other users, including their `id`, `last_access`, and `last_page` fields.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #19155, which aimed to unify data fetching logic between REST and GraphQL endpoints.
- The vulnerability affects versions >=10.3 and is patched in version 10.5.0.

**CVSS v3 Base Metrics:**
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)
