Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper masking of AWS credentials within log files during Packer builds performed by Rosco. Specifically, the `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` were not being masked by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to mask sensitive AWS credentials in Packer commands.
- Exposure of secrets in log files.
- Exposure of secrets in bake job history.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of AWS access keys and secret keys, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the AWS account.
- Potential unauthorized access to AWS resources, leading to data breaches, resource compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to log files generated during Packer builds.
- Access to bake job history stored in redis.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need access to the logs or job history of Rosco's Packer builds. This could involve access to the server's file system, the redis database or access to the relevant logging systems.
- The attacker needs some level of access within the system to view log files or job history.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Spinnaker versions prior to 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3.
- The fix involves masking the parameters by default, and has been backported to the aforementioned versions.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity.
- The suggested workaround is using short-lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles.
- It's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY, SECRET\_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs.
- It is recommended to rotate the compromised credentials.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).
