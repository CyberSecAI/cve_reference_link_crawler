# improper log masking on AWS Packer builds

Moderate

[jasonmcintosh](/jasonmcintosh)
published
GHSA-2233-cqj8-j2q5
Jan 3, 2023

## Package

spinnaker

## Affected versions

<1.29.2,<1.28.4,<1.27.3

## Patched versions

1.29.2,1.28.4,1.27.3

## Description

### Impact

Rosco currently does not property mask AWS hard coded secrets when doing packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in log files and bake job history in redis.

### Patches

Fixed in Rosco and backported to prior releases of spinnaker for 1.29, 1.28 and 1.27

### Workarounds

It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure.

If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY, SECRET\_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
