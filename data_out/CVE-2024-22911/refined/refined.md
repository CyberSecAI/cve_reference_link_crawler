The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `parseExpression` function at `src/swfc.c:2602` due to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `parseExpression` function
- Out-of-bounds write to stack memory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash (as evidenced by the AddressSanitizer output and `ABORTING` message).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker gains enough control over the overflowed buffer to overwrite the return address or other critical stack data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted SWF file using the `swfc` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious SWF file to the `swfc` tool as input.
- The attacker does not appear to need any special privileges.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `parseExpression` function called within the `parseTwip` function, `texture2` function, `c_gradient` function, `parseArgumentsForCommand` function and eventually in `main` function.
- The overflow occurs when writing to a memory location `0x7fffffffd234`, which is located within the stack of thread T0 at offset 1172 in frame  `parseTwip`.
- The stack frame of `parseTwip` contains multiple variables: `chr2index.i`, `stack.i`, and `values.i`, the memory access at offset 1172 underflows the variable `stack.i`.
- The AddressSanitizer output provides specific details on the location, size of the write, and the impacted stack frame.
