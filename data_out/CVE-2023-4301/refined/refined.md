The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4301.

**CVE-2023-4301:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Fortify Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission checks.
    *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   HTTP endpoints that lack permission checks
    *   HTTP endpoints that lack CSRF protection
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
    *   An attacker needs to induce a user to make a request to exploit the CSRF vulnerability
