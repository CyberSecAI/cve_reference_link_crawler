- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation which allows attackers to manipulate file paths to access directories outside the intended web root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory Traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in file paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system. No special access or privileges beyond network access are mentioned.
