Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `formQOSRuleDel` function of the Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware.
*   The `qosIndex` parameter from a POST request is used to set the `indexSet` variable, which is then directly copied into a local buffer (`input`) using `strcpy`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking, and the size of the destination buffer `input` is fixed.
*   **Unvalidated input:** The `qosIndex` parameter, which is user-controlled, is not validated for length before being used in the `strcpy` operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a POST request to the `formQOSRuleDel` function with a `qosIndex` parameter that exceeds the buffer's capacity (`input`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected Tenda W15EV1.0 device.
*   The attacker needs to know the endpoint that uses the `formQOSRuleDel` function, including the required parameters (specifically, `qosIndex`).

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware, specifically in the `formQOSRuleDel` function, caused by the insecure use of `strcpy` with an attacker-controlled parameter `qosIndex`. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
