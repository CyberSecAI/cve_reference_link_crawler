{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malicious VF (Virtual Function) driver could request an excessive number of FDIR (Flow Director) filters, exhausting resources and impacting other VFs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of per-VF limit on the number of FDIR filters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Resource exhaustion, potentially leading to denial of service for other VFs.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious VF driver requesting more FDIR filters than the hardware or software can handle.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs control over a VF driver."
