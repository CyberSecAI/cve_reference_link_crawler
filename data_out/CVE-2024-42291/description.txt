In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Add a per-VF limit on number of FDIR filters

While the iavf driver adds a s/w limit (128) on the number of FDIR
filters that the VF can request, a malicious VF driver can request more
than that and exhaust the resources for other VFs.

Add a similar limit in ice.
