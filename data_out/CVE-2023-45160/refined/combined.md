##### DESCRIPTION

1E Client installer can perform arbitrary file deletion on protected files. A non-privileged user could provide a symbolic link or Windows junction to point to a protected directory in the installer that the 1E Client would then clear on service startup.

A hotfix is available from the 1E support portal that forces the 1E Client to check for a symbolic link or junction and if it finds one refuses to use that path and instead creates a path involving a random GUID.

for v8.1 use hotfix Q23097

for v8.4 use hotfix Q23105

for v9.0 use hotfix Q23115

for SaaS customers, use 1EClient v23.7 plus hotfix Q23121

##### DESCRIPTION

The MSI installer in 1E Client 4.1.0.267 and 5.0.0.745 allows remote authenticated users and local users to gain elevated privileges via the repair option. This applies to installations that have a TRANSFORM (MST) with the option to disable the installation of the Nomad module. An attacker may craft a .reg file in a specific location that will be able to write to any registry key as an elevated user.

##### DESCRIPTION

The %PROGRAMDATA%\1E\Client directory in 1E Client 5.0.0.745 and 4.1.0.267 allows remote authenticated users and local users to create and modify files in protected directories (where they would not normally have access to create or modify files) via the creation of a junction point to a system directory. This leads to partial privilege escalation. This vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the permission of the ProgramData\1E\Client directory so that a standard user does not have the ability to create and modify files.

# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

LAST UPDATED: MAY 07, 2024
### Introduction​

This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering reporting to 1E so long as the 1E website has a published security.txt file that references this policy.

We recommend reading this vulnerability disclosure policy fully before you report a vulnerability and always acting in compliance with it.

We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities according to this policy. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability disclosures.

### Reporting

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability relating to 1E’s system, please submit a vulnerability report to the address defined in the CONTACT field of the published security.txt file.

In your report please include details of:

**Title**

Concise summary categorising the vulnerability, and the site/application where it can be found E.g. Reflected XSS on the XYZ website**Asset (M)**

Web address, IP address, product, service name, etc.

**Weakness**

Such as a CVE

**Severity**

Such as low, medium, high, critical, and the calculated via CVSS

**Description of the Vulnerability (M)**

– A summary of the vulnerability

– Supporting files (e.g. screenshot or video)

– Any mitigations or recommendations

**Steps to reproduce (M)**

– Clear and descriptive steps to reproduce the vulnerability

– These should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept.

**Impact**

The effects of successfully exploiting the vulnerability.

**Contact details**

– Name

– Email Address

(These details are optional to enable anonymous reporting)

*(M) denotes mandatory field*

### What to expect​

After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 5 working days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days. We’ll also aim to keep you informed of our progress.

Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity and exploit complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are welcome to enquire on the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14 days. This allows our teams to focus on the remediation.

We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.

Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report. We’d like to unify our guidance, so please do continue to coordinate public release with us.

### Guidance

You must NOT:

* Break any applicable law or regulations.
* Access unnecessary, excessive or significant amounts of data.
* Modify data in 1E’s systems or services.
* Use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.
* Attempt or report any form of denial of service, e.g. overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests.
* Disrupt 1E’s services or systems.
* Submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that the services do not fully align with “best practice”, for example missing security headers.
* Submit reports detailing TLS configuration weaknesses, for example “weak” cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support.
* Communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in the published security.txt.
* Social engineer, ‘phish’ or physically attack 1E’s staff or infrastructure.
* Demand financial compensation in order to disclose any vulnerabilities.

You must:

* Always comply with data protection rules and must not violate the privacy of any data 1E holds. You must not, for example, share, redistribute or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services.
* Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).
### Legalities​​

This policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability disclosure best practice. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law, or which might cause 1E, our customers or partner organisations to be in breach of any legal obligations.
