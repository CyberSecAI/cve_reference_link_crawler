The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-45160.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 1E Client for Windows did not properly restrict access to its temporary directory where instruction resource files were stored. This allowed an ordinary user to replace a legitimate resource file with a malicious script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties: The 1E Client's temporary directory was not properly protected, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By substituting a malicious script, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the 1E Client.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable 1E Client.
- File substitution: The attacker replaces a legitimate resource script file with a malicious one in the 1E Client's temporary directory before it's executed by the client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local, non-privileged user on the machine where the vulnerable 1E client is installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the 1E Client's temporary directory before the client accesses the resource file in that directory.

**Affected Versions:**
- 8.1.2.62
- 8.4.1.159
- 9.0.1.88
- 23.7.1.151

**Resolution:**
The vulnerability is resolved by applying patch Q23094, which locks down the 1E Client's temporary directory.
