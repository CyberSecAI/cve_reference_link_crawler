| Hello,  The [GitHub Security Lab team](https://securitylab.github.com/) has found a potential vulnerability in your project. Please create a [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) and invite me in to further disclose and discuss the vulnerability details and potential fix. Alternatively, please add a [Security Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) containing a security email address to send the details to.  Kind regards, A |
