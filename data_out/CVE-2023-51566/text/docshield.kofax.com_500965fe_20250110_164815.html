## Special instructions

**1941298: Enhancement: Added the capability to include ZertES certificates to the list of trusted certificates for Power PDF.**

To add ZertES certificates to Power PDF's trusted list, you must apply the `zertes-5.0.0.14.mst` transform file to the fix pack installer.

Transform files can be applied through the command line, for example:

`KofaxPowerPdfAdvanced.5.0.0.14.msi TRANSFORMS=zertes-5.0.0.14.mst`

In the case of the deployment using Active Directory, you can also specify it in the appropriate field.

The transform file is part of this fix pack distribution fileset, and can be found in the `..\ZertES\` subfolder.

**1953934: Enhancement: New GPO setting created for specifying whether to use Windows user name as the author of the document or not.**

Import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Preferences > Do not use user name as the author of the document*

**1884412: Enhancement: New GPO setting created for specifying the list of "Allowed/Disallowed attachment file types".**

Import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Application Options > Allow/Disallow File Attachemnt Types*

**1928767: Enhancement: New GPO setting created for predefining the "WCS: Validate Signatures" and "WCS: Validate Certificate Documents" options.**

Import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Application Options > Signatures > Validate: Trust ALL root certificates in WCS for Certified documents*

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Application Options > Signatures > Validate: Trust ALL root certificates in WCS for Signatures*

**1900036: Enhancement: New GPO settings for hiding and showing the buttons on the Outlook add-in toolbar.**

Import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Ribbon > Hide buttons on the Ribbon of the Outlook Add-in*

**1899136: Enhancement: New GPO setting created for hiding and showing the "Reset list of allowed/disallowed file attachment types" check box.**

Import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Application Options > Show / Hide elements on Attachments panel*

**1885670: Default mail signature did not appear in e-mails sent from Power PDF.**

Since this issue is actually a side effect on the Outlook side, the fix has not been implemented permanently. It can be controlled by a new **Group Policy** setting: **Allow signatures for new emails**, which is not configured by default.

To activate the fix, import Power PDF GPO templates provided with this delivery to Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) and configure the new setting.

Note: This setting is available both for `Computer Configuration` and `User Configuration`, but the `Computer Configuration` setting overrides the other.

*Administrative Templates > Kofax Power PDF 5.0 > Preferences > Allow signatures for new emails*

In the Registry, this GPO setting is reflected as follows:

HKLM and HKCU Software\Policies\Kofax\PowerPDF 5.0\PREFERENCES\
NewEmailAllowSignature
1: old code (allows signature to be applied by default)
0: new code (signature will not be applied by default)
Key does not exist (GPO not configured): same as 0

**1884467: Power PDF did not open PDFs embedded in MS Office documents as Adobe Acrobat PDFs.**

To register Power PDF as the default viewer application for PDFs embedded in MS Office documents as Adobe Acrobat PDFs, execute the following command:

**`DefaultViewer.exe /AddAutoConvertToKey`**

To unregister Power PDF:

**`DefaultViewer.exe /DeleteAutoConvertToKey`**

**Note:** Administrator rights are required to execute this command.

**1838044: Specific PDF files did not embed fonts in PDF/A formats.**

Since the reported issue is not a bug (embedding standard fonts are not required per PDF/A specification), we do not want to change the default behavior because embedding unnecessary fonts increases the file size.

To activate this preference, add the following line to the `%ProgramData%\Kofax\PDF\PDFConv.ini` file:

AlwaysEmbedFonts=1

In case the file does not exist, create it.

**1816412: Printing to Power PDF from Windows Metro Apps caused the print job to hang in the queue (in effect since Windows 10 19044.1466).**

To resolve this issue, install the "**Port Monitor for Power PDF printer**" that is bundled with this fix pack:

Find the "Port Monitor for Power PDF printer.zip" in the "..\Port Monitor for Power PDF printer\" subfolder of this fix pack package.

The .zip file contains both 32-bit and 64-bit installers. Use the one appropriate for your operating system:

* Port Monitor for Power PDF printer (32-bit).msi
* Port Monitor for Power PDF printer (64-bit).msi
