In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

selinux: avoid dereference of garbage after mount failure

In case kern_mount() fails and returns an error pointer return in the
error branch instead of continuing and dereferencing the error pointer.

While on it drop the never read static variable selinuxfs_mount.
