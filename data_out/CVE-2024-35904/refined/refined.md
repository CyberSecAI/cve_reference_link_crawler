Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential null pointer dereference in the SELinux file system initialization code. Specifically, if the `kern_mount()` function fails during the mounting of the SELinux file system, it returns an error pointer. The code was not properly handling this error case and would proceed to dereference this error pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The primary weakness is the incorrect handling of an error pointer returned by `kern_mount()`. The code attempts to use the error pointer as a valid pointer which leads to the dereference of a null or invalid address which causes a crash or undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a kernel crash. This can result in a denial of service, impacting the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Mount failure:** The attack vector is by triggering a failure during the mounting of the SELinux file system. This can be achieved by various means, such as:
    - Insufficient resources or permissions.
    - Incorrect configuration.
    - Internal system errors.
    - Maliciously crafted conditions designed to trigger the error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a mount failure of the selinuxfs file system. The precise conditions of that failure depend on the system environment and configuration.
- Since this is a kernel level vulnerability, it can be triggered by userspace with the ability to trigger the mount process.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided patches fix the vulnerability by adding an error check before dereferencing the pointer returned by `kern_mount()`. It also removes an unused variable.
-   The mailing list discussion reveals that CVEs are often assigned after stable releases, and that there isn't a good way to determine definitively when a CVE applies, and therefore manual work is still required for maintainers of downstream kernels.

In summary, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to an improper handling of errors during the mount of the SELinux file system, which can cause a kernel crash. The patches address this by adding proper error handling.
