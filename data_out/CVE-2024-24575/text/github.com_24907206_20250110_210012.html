# Denial of service attack in `git\_revparse\_single`

Moderate

[ethomson](/ethomson)
published
GHSA-54mf-x2rh-hq9v
Feb 6, 2024

## Package

libgit2
(C)

## Affected versions

>= 1.4.0, < 1.6.5
>= 1.4.0, < 1.7.2

## Patched versions

1.6.5
1.7.2

## Description

### Impact

Using well-crafted inputs to `git_revparse_single` can cause the function to enter an infinite loop, potentially causing a Denial of Service attack in the calling application.

### Detailed description

The revparse function in `src/libgit2/revparse.c` uses a loop to parse the user-provided spec string. There is an edge-case during parsing that allows a bad actor to force the loop conditions to access arbitrary memory.

This can be abused to create an infinite loop in the revparse function. Potentially, this could also leak memory if the extracted rev spec is reflected back to the attacker. This issue was introduced in the commit [add2dabb3c16aa49b33904dcdc07cd915efc12fa](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/commit/add2dabb3c16aa49b33904dcdc07cd915efc12fa). As such, libgit2 versions before 1.4.0 are not affected. Some of the language-specific wrappers (such as e.g. Rugged for ruby) bundle old versions of libgit2 (i.e., < 1.4) and are not affected. pygit2 since version 1.9 and git2go since v34 are affected.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to v1.6.5 or v1.7.2.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-24575

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
