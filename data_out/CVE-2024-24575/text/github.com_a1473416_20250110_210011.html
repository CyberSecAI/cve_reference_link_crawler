[v1.6.5](/libgit2/libgit2/tree/v1.6.5)

[`1555785`](/libgit2/libgit2/commit/155578578b78efc6bae7383a708d470eb206e36a)

üîí This is a security release with multiple changes.

* A bug in `git_revparse_single` is fixed that could have caused the function to enter an infinite loop given well-crafted inputs, potentially causing a Denial of Service attack in the calling application. This fixes [CVE-2024-24575](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-54mf-x2rh-hq9v), which was discovered by researchers at Amazon AWS.
* A bug in `git_index_add` is fixed that could have caused the function to corrupt its heap and possibly lead to arbitrary code execution. This fixes [CVE-2024-24577](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-j2v7-4f6v-gpg8), which was discovered by researchers at Amazon AWS.
* A bug in the smart transport negotiation could have caused an out-of-bounds read when a remote server did not advertise capabilities.

The libgit2 project thanks the researchers and outreach team at AWS Security for finding the `git_index_add` and `git_revparse_single` bugs, and providing details and reproduction steps during their responsible disclosure.

All users of the v1.6 release line are recommended to upgrade.
