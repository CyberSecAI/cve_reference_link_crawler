This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix a potential security exploit in RaggedArray.loads(buffer, ldtype=…

…np.uint64).

When parsing binary data with ldtype=np.uint64, if a length is sufficiently
close to 2^64 that it causes the parsing buffer pointer (starting from &buffer)
to overflow, then arbitrary memory owned by the current process and whose
address is < &buffer can be read. Should the overflow map the pointer to a
location not owned by the current process, a segfault will occur.

Overflow is now caught and raised as a ValueError() (like in any other case
where the parsing fails).
