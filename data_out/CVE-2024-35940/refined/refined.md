Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35940:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing null pointer check in the `psz_kmsg_read` function within the Linux kernel's pstore/zone subsystem. The `kasprintf` function, used to allocate memory for a formatted string, can return NULL if memory allocation fails. The code did not check for this NULL return, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the absence of a check for a NULL return value from the `kasprintf` function. This leads to a null pointer dereference when the code attempts to use the returned (NULL) pointer in the subsequent `strlen` call.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the kernel crash resulting from the null pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves triggering the `psz_kmsg_read` function in a situation where `kasprintf` might fail to allocate memory. The specifics of how to reliably cause `kasprintf` to fail aren't described in the provided context, but this usually involves exhausting system memory or other resource constraints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to trigger the `psz_kmsg_read` function. This might involve a local user or a privileged process that can influence the pstore/zone subsystem.

**Code Changes (Patch):**

The fix involves adding a simple null pointer check after the call to `kasprintf`:

```diff
--- a/fs/pstore/zone.c
+++ b/fs/pstore/zone.c
@@ -973,6 +973,8 @@
 static ssize_t psz_kmsg_read(struct pstore_zone *zone, char *buf = kasprintf(GFP_KERNEL, "%s: Total %d times\n", kmsg_dump_reason_str(record->reason), record->count);
+       if (!buf)
+               return -ENOMEM;
        hlen = strlen(buf);
        record->buf = krealloc(buf, hlen + size, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!record->buf) {
```

This patch ensures that if `kasprintf` fails (returns NULL), the function will return `-ENOMEM` rather than dereferencing a null pointer and crashing.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes multiple instances of the same fix being backported across various stable kernel versions. This indicates a wide impact.
* The Debian LTS advisory lists this CVE as one of many fixed in a security update for Linux 5.10.

In summary, CVE-2024-35940 is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linux kernel pstore/zone subsystem due to a missing null check after calling `kasprintf`. Exploitation leads to a kernel crash and DoS. The fix involves adding a check for a NULL return from `kasprintf` and handling it appropriately.
