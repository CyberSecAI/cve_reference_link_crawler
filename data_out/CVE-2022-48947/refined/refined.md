{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `chan->num_conf_rsp` counter, which tracks the number of L2CAP configuration responses, is an 8-bit unsigned integer. Repeatedly sending `L2CAP_CONF_REQ` packets causes this counter to increment without limit. This leads to an integer overflow, where the counter wraps around to 0 after reaching its maximum value of 255.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow in the L2CAP configuration response counter could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or issues with Bluetooth connections. The provided btmon log shows that invalid packet sizes were detected, which is a consequence of this vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending multiple L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send L2CAP configuration request packets to a vulnerable device."
  },
  "resolution": "The patch adds a check to ensure that `chan->num_conf_rsp` does not exceed `L2CAP_MAX_CONF_RSP` before incrementing it, preventing the overflow."
