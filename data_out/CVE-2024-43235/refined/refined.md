Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a "Broken Access Control" issue within the Meta Box WordPress plugin. This indicates a failure to properly enforce authorization or authentication checks within a function of the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core vulnerability is a missing check for authorization, authentication, or nonce tokens in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as "low severity" and "unlikely to be exploited,". However, the general description of Broken Access Control suggests that the consequences could vary depending on the specific function affected. The potential includes an unprivileged user being able to perform privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting a function in the plugin where the proper access control checks are missing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be at least a "Contributor" level user. This indicates that an authenticated user, with basic access to the WordPress admin area, can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found by Rafie Muhammad (Patchstack) and was assigned a CVSS score of 7.1. However, the description notes that "it is not ideal for CMSs".
*   The vulnerable plugin versions are <= 5.9.10, and the issue is fixed in version 5.9.11.
