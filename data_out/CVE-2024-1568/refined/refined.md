### Summary of Vulnerability Information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-controlled input passed to the `OnAdminApi_HtmlCheck` function, which allows for arbitrary URL requests to be made from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application makes web requests to arbitrary locations based on user-provided input without sufficient validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authenticated attackers can make web requests to arbitrary locations. This could be used to:
    - Query and modify information from internal services not meant to be publicly accessible.
    - Potentially compromise internal systems by leveraging the serverâ€™s trust relationships within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `OnAdminApi_HtmlCheck` function, where the attacker controls the destination URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site to trigger this vulnerability.
