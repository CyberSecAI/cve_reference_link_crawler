Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Helm 3 CLI, when using the `--dry-run` option, outputs the content of Kubernetes secrets in clear text to the console. This behavior is a change from Helm 2, which did not output secret content in dry-run mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Secrets, which are intended to be protected, are displayed in plain text in the command output.
- **Insecure Default Behavior:** The `--dry-run` option, intended for testing and not applying changes, unexpectedly exposes sensitive information.
- **Lack of Control:** Users cannot prevent the display of secret values with the default dry-run behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Secrets could be unintentionally exposed in CI/CD logs or other shared output, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Compromised Infrastructure:** Exposed secrets could be used to compromise the applications, infrastructure, or data associated with the secrets.
- **Security Incident:** The exposure of sensitive information can result in a security incident and damage an organization's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-Line Output:** An attacker with access to the command-line output, such as in CI/CD logs, can view the exposed secrets.
- **Accidental Exposure:** Users may accidentally share the output containing secrets via screen sharing or copy-pasting the output in a public forum.
- **Compromised Systems:** If a system with access to the Helm CLI is compromised, an attacker could easily extract secrets by using the `--dry-run` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Command Output:** An attacker needs access to the output of the `helm upgrade/install --dry-run` command. This could be through access to CI/CD logs, terminal sessions, or other locations where command output is displayed.
- **Basic Helm Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `helm upgrade/install` command and the `--dry-run` option.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require elevated privileges on the target Kubernetes cluster to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported in December 2019 and has remained open for an extended period, despite being acknowledged as a security concern.
- The Helm maintainers have cited backwards compatibility as the reason for not removing the output of secrets by default. They have suggested a feature flag (`--sanitize` or similar) as a solution.
- Multiple community members have provided workarounds using tools like `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `yq`, and custom Helm plugins to mask secrets in the output.
- A CVE (CVE-2019-25210) has been assigned to this vulnerability.
-  A fix has been merged that adds a `--hide-secrets` flag to prevent the output of secrets during dry-run.

In summary, Helm 3's `--dry-run` output exposes secrets in plain text, which presents a significant security risk, particularly in automated deployment pipelines. While workarounds exist, a native fix within Helm was highly desired. A fix introducing a `--hide-secrets` flag has been merged.
