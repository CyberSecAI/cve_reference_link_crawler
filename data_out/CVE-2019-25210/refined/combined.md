| Hi [@darkstarmv](https://github.com/darkstarmv). It looks as though `helm install --dry-run` intentionally displays this output:     [helm/cmd/helm/status.go](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/0eaa881c4e699910f1db97ac889f573124f002f3/cmd/helm/status.go#L141)  Line 141 in [0eaa881](/helm/helm/commit/0eaa881c4e699910f1db97ac889f573124f002f3)   |  | if strings.EqualFold(s.release.Info.Description, "Dry run complete") || s.debug { | | --- | --- |      What is your recommended course of action here?  We could relax this constraint to only display this output when the `--debug` flag is applied. However, I am concerned about this breaking backwards compatibility, and that there may be users who are relying on this behaviour since this was intentionally introduced.  [@thomastaylor312](https://github.com/thomastaylor312) any thoughts here? |

| So given our backwards compatibility guarantees, we cannot remove the secret output by default. However, we would be more than willing to review and accept any implementation that uses a feature flag (something like --sanitize) to prevent those values from printing. I'll relabel this as a feature and anyone can implement it |

| [@thomastaylor312](https://github.com/thomastaylor312) i am not quite understand your comment about backwards compatibility. Helm 2 with dry-run did not exposed secrets, and Helm 3 expose them. So actually there is breaking compatibility changes introduced in Helm 3. Also if regular update/run do not expose secrets, i would expect from dry-run same. Because dry-run means: run as regular, but don't apply changes. We see different behavior here. It would be confusing if we would need to use extra flag for getting same behavior for dry-run and regular run. |

| [@EssentialMix](https://github.com/EssentialMix) has it right. Helm 3 broke the backward compatibility of the Helm 2 --dry-run behavior.  Helm 2 --dry-run did not print *any* output (let alone secrets) as you can see here:  ``` $ helm version Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.16.3", GitCommit:"1ee0254c86d4ed6887327dabed7aa7da29d7eb0d", GitTreeState:"clean"} Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.16.3", GitCommit:"1ee0254c86d4ed6887327dabed7aa7da29d7eb0d", GitTreeState:"clean"}  $ helm install . --dry-run                                     NAME:   anxious-marmot <end-of-output> ``` |

| By backwards compatibility we don't mean with Helm 2. The reason for a new major version of Helm was to introduce breaking changes like this one. Now that the feature is in place, our backwards compatibility guarantees have to be honored for all of v3. However, this statement is interesting and deserves conversation:  We see different behavior here. It would be confusing if we would need to use extra flag for getting same behavior for dry-run and regular run.  This is something we'd have to run by other maintainers if we choose to do it because it would be a breaking change in Helm 3, something we do very very rarely and very carefully |

| Just adding a me-too to keep it alive and add my input.  My biggest issue with this is that when wrapping a helm release into a pipeline using things like Gitlab or Actions etc - then secrets get dumped all over job logs when we are executing a dryrun as one of the tests. This requires then a team to a) be aware its even happening and b) go and manually delete jobs or even entire pipelines in order to hide these credentials.  Given that a CI pipeline is a very prominent case for the existence of the dry-run flag in the first place, I feel it should be handled better  Its a giant hole - it would be bad enough should a developers SCM account get exposed, but to also gift an attacker then access to secrets / infra credentials is like a nuke :)  Can I suggest an opt-in `--hide-secrets` flag that perhaps would not then be a breaking change? |

In our pipelines, the quandry is to allow the use of the --dry-run or --debug flag to help our product teams debug their deployments but also at the same time, the concern that @sean-ersw articulates that secrets are printed to the CD (Jenkins) console.  For deployments to production environments we may consider not allowing the use of a --debug or --dry-run flag and we may even have to go there for our staging/verify environments. I'd prefer we didn't have to.  The ability to enforce in our pipeline code the use of a --hide-secrets flag whenever a --debug or --dry-run flag is provided in a helm command line would a) not restrict our end users current capabilities to use --dry-run or --debug flags and b) tighten this security hole when automating the use of helm in a CD pipeline.  I think this is a serious enough consideration for the community to consider a solution, given that the use of helm in automation is common. |

| Same story here, secrets in logs aren't secrets at all.  I also think this an issue and should be fixed. [@NBardelot](https://github.com/NBardelot) provided a one-line solution in perl; similar solution should be available in go.  ``` | perl -0777 -pe "s/---.*?type: Opaque.*?---/---/sg" ```  One more option for mitigating this using yq:  ``` helm template helm/ | yq --yaml-roundtrip '( select(.kind == "Secret")  | (.data[]?, .stringData[]?) ) = "[Masked]"' ``` |

| For those who run CI pipeline w/o perl, the following is awk cmd solution:  `helm upgrade --dry-run ... | awk 'BEGIN{RS="---"; ORS="***"}{ gsub("type: Opaque.*", "[HIDDEN]\n"); print; }'`  This will replace the secret object output such that all lines after and including "type: Opaque" in the secret output is replaced with [HIDDEN].  I hope this helps those who don't have perl. |

| For others bumping into this.  `helm template --debug --values` also exposes the secrets.  A way to avoid the secrets showing up in the CLI output is **to pipe the result of the command to sed** and mutate it:  `sed '/^kind: Secret/,/^---/{//!d;};'`  For us this resulted in the section looking like this in the output:  ``` [...] apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret --- [...]  ```  yet I fully agree with all others here stating, that this should be solved in helm directly |

| For anyone still experiencing this issue -- this is a `sed` command that deletes everything from `USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:` down:  ``` helm install --debug ... | sed '/USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:/,$d' ```  We now use this in our deploys, so we can debug when a deploy fails, but not print any secrets/configuration that may reveal sensitive data. |

| We used [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq), tail and head to redact any element's value in any depth with any name. (Raspberry PI 4, Ubuntu 23.10, helm vesion 3.10.1) Say for example the field `name` has to be redacted everywhere then with [yq 4.40.4](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/v4.40.4), tail and head I can do the following:  ``` helm upgrade --install --dry-run --debug my-release ./path/to/chart/ | tail -n +11 | head -n -4|yq eval '(.. | select(has("name")) | .name) |= "REDACTED"' ```  What is happening:   * tail removes the first 11 lines. That part is metadata like NAME, LAST DEPLOYED, NAMESPACE, etc. and it isn't for yq consumption * head removes the 4 lines from the end because that is also metadata. For now I only saw NOTES: as metadata. * yq will evaluate every element which has a subelement name. If it finds one then the name's value will be replaced with REDACTED.   If we want to redact more than one element value then multiple yq statements can be chained one after another:  ``` helm upgrade --install --dry-run --debug my-release ./path/to/chart/ | tail -n +11 | head -n -4 | yq eval '(.. | select(has("name")) | .name) |= "REDACTED"'  | yq eval '(.. | select(has("securityContext")) | .securityContext) |= "REDACTED"' ```  This will replace name and securityContext values everywhere with REDACTED. There is probably a better shorter way of writing this, but I found it more readable.  Note: Omitting `--debug` from helm chart will print less metadata. In that case tail should be reduced to +9 from +11. |

| This looks like there are several suggestions and tools to address the issue. Closing.  There are *zero* suggestions or tools to address the critical security issue. Rather, there are a several kludges that can be used to workaround it as long as every single team member remembers to use a non-obvious pipe consistently, all the time. That does not address the issue. Adding a `--sanitize` flag or similar that natively performs the operation without breaking backwards compatibility would be a good resolution. |

| When trying to add the kludges mentioned, there's an unfortunate side-effect: piping output without `-o pipefail` shell option, means that when Helm dies with an error, the secret-munging thing being piped to returns success rather than failure, so any jobs looking for Helm exit status show success every time. This can be worked around by enabling `-o pipefail` or using Bash's PIPESTATUS and checking the Helm part of the pipe... but this is now getting a little complicated.  The maintainers said they would be willing for somebody else to contribute a new feature flag to hide secret values. But I would argue that far fewer people depend on this "feature", than will be affected by the security hole it introduces.  Therefore, I would urge [@bacongobbler](https://github.com/bacongobbler) , [@thomastaylor312](https://github.com/thomastaylor312) , and any other Helm contributors, to reconsider the Helm backwards compatibility guarantee here, and implement a fix themselves to implicitly stop showing secret values. Yes, this will be a breaking change. But nobody will blame you for breaking compatibility in order to close a pretty big security hole. I think you would probably expect the same of a different project... |
