Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper use of `add_query_arg` without proper escaping within the Waitlist Woocommerce (Back in stock notifier) WordPress plugin. This allows the injection of malicious code via the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input that is reflected back in the page's HTML. Specifically, the `add_query_arg` function was used to generate URLs without escaping the arguments, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user clicks on a crafted link, the injected scripts will execute in the user's browser.
- This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a script.
- They then trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click a link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code was present in `admin/templates/xoo-wl-import-form.php` and `admin/class-xoo-wl-admin-settings.php`.
- The fix involves using `esc_url()` to properly escape the URL generated by `add_query_arg`.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.7.5.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.6.
