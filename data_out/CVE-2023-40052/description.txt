This issue affects Progress Application Server (PAS) for OpenEdge in versions 11.7 prior to 11.7.18, 12.2 prior to 12.2.13, and innovation releases prior to 12.8.0

. 

An attacker who can produce a malformed web request may cause the crash of a PASOE agent potentially disrupting the thread activities of many web application clients. Multiple of these DoS attacks could lead to the flooding of invalid requests as compared to the server’s remaining ability to process valid requests.
