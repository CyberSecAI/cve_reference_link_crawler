# Redacted data extraction on the API through "alias"

Moderate

[rijkvanzanten](/rijkvanzanten)
published
GHSA-p8v3-m643-4xqx
May 13, 2024

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<10.11.0

## Patched versions

10.11.0

## Description

## Summary

A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API.

Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field.

## Steps to reproduce

* Set up a simple role with read-access to users.
* Create a new user with the role from the previous step
* Assign a password to the user

The easiest way to confirm this vulnerability is by first visiting `/users/me`. You should be presented with a redacted JSON-object.

Next, visit `/users/me?alias[hash]=password`. This time, the returned JSON object will included the raw password hash instead of the redacted value.

## Workaround

This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
