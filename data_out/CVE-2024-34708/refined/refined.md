Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-34708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Directus handles redacted (hashed) fields in API responses when using the `alias` functionality.  Instead of consistently returning the redacted version of a field (e.g. `**********`), the system exposes the raw value when an alias is used in the API query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Exposure:**  Sensitive data, such as password hashes meant to be redacted, is exposed through the API.
- **Inconsistent Redaction:** The redaction mechanism is circumvented by using the `alias` parameter, which bypasses the intended data masking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can bypass the redaction of sensitive data and obtain the raw values of these fields.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** If password hashes are exposed, attackers might try to crack them, leading to account takeovers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Manipulation:** By crafting a specific API request using the `alias` parameter, an attacker can retrieve sensitive data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privilege:** The attacker needs to have read access to collections containing redacted fields.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the API.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to understand the alias functionality of the API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Directus versions prior to 10.11.0.
- The fix is implemented in version 10.11.0
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The attack vector is over the network.
- The attack complexity is low.
- The privileges required are "High" meaning the attacker needs some level of access to the application.
- No user interaction is required.
- The vulnerability impacts confidentiality
- The associated CWE is CWE-200.
