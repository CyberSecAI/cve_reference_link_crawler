# External RoleTemplates can lead to privilege escalation

Moderate

[pdellamore](/pdellamore)
published
GHSA-64jq-m7rq-768h
Jun 17, 2024

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.7.0, < 2.7.14
>=2.8.0, <2.8.5

## Patched versions

2.7.14
2.8.5

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been identified whereby privilege escalation checks are not properly enforced for `RoleTemplate`objects when external=true, which in specific scenarios can lead to privilege escalation.

The bug in the webhook rule resolver ignores rules from a `ClusterRole` for external `RoleTemplates` when its context is set to either `project` or is left empty. The fix introduces a new field to the `RoleTemplate` CRD named `ExternalRules`. The new field will be used to resolve rules directly from the `RoleTemplate`. Additionally, rules from the backing `ClusterRole` will be used if `ExternalRules` is not provided. The new field will always take precedence when it is set, and serve as the source of truth for rules used when creating Rancher resources on the local cluster.

Please note that this is a breaking change for external `RoleTemplates`, when context is set to `project` or empty and the backing `ClusterRole` does not exist, as this was not previously required.

**Important:** The fix is automatically applied when upgrading to the release lines `2.8`and above. For users still on the `2.7` release line, after the upgrade to a patched version, users are required to opt-in to the fix by enabling the `external-rules` [feature flag](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/feature-flags).

Please consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/) for further information about this category of attack.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases `2.7.14` and `2.8.5`.

### Workarounds

The following script was developed for Rancher Manager administrators to identify `RoleTemplates` impacted by this vulnerability. The script requires `jq` installed and a `kubeconfig` with access to Rancher local cluster; it can also be executed in Rancher's kubectl shell.

```
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# get all RoleTemplates with .context == "project" or .context == "" that don't have externalRules.
rts=$(kubectl get roletemplates -o json | jq -r  '.items[] | select((.context == "project" or .context == "") and .external == true and .externalRules == null and .builtin == false) | .metadata.name')
found_invalid_rt=false

for rt in $rts; do
  if ! kubectl get clusterrole "$rt" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
     echo "$rt" # prints RoleTemplate names that don't have a backing ClusterRole
     found_invalid_rt=true
  fi
done

if ! $found_invalid_rt ; then
    echo 'This cluster is not affected by CVE-2023-32197: no RoleTemplate objects found'
fi
```

It will return all objects affected by this vulnerability. The administrator can fix those objects by creating the backing `ClusterRole` that they refer to.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
