The provided content is related to CVE-2024-4192.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2. The software does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The software fails to check the size of the input before copying it to a stack-based buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is too large.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
*   The user must perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Local access to the system with the affected software
*   The attacker must be able to supply malicious input to the vulnerable function.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
