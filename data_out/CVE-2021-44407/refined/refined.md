- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. The code assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object and accesses it using the subscription operator without proper type checking. When a non-object (like a string) is provided as the `param` value, this leads to an assertion failure which terminates the `cgiserver.cgi` process, eventually causing the device to reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the JSON `param` field before it is passed to API-specific parsers. The code expects the `param` field to always be a JSON object, but it does not check if the `param` is indeed a JSON object before attempting to access its members, resulting in an assertion failure when a different type is received.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) by causing the device to reboot. This can disrupt the functionality of the camera.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP request with a JSON body is sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The JSON body contains a command with a `param` field that is not a JSON object, triggering the vulnerability during parsing of the parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the device and be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. It is noted that prior authentication is required for most of these APIs, but it can be bypassed by leveraging another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420).

Specifically for CVE-2021-44407:
- The `TestEmail` API is vulnerable. If the `param` field in the JSON request for this API is not an object (e.g., an empty string), the `cgiserver.cgi` process will crash, leading to a device reboot.
