# Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-skin-ui

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-h4vp-69r8-gvjg
Jul 14, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-skin-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 7.0-rc-1, < 14.4.8
>= 14.5, < 14.10.4

## Patched versions

14.4.8
14.10.4, 15.0-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

Improper escaping in the document `SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet` leads to a possible privilege escalation from view right on that document to programming rights, or in other words, it is possible to execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents.

The attack works by opening a non-existing page with a name crafted to contain a dangerous payload.

It is possible to check if an existing installation is vulnerable by opening `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/%22%5D%5D%20%7B%7Basync%20async%3D%22true%22%20cached%3D%22false%22%20context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln(%22Hello%20%22%20%2B%20%22from%20groovy!%22)%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D?sheet=SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet&xpage=view` where <xwiki-host is the URL of the XWiki installation. The expected result are two list items with "Edit this skin" and "Test this skin" without any further text. If the installation is vulnerable, the second list item is "Test this skin Hello from groovy!.WebHome"]]". This shows that the Groovy macro has been executed.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4 and 15.0-rc-1.

### Workarounds

The [fix](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d9c88ddc4c0c78fa534bd33237e95dea66003d29) can also be applied manually to the impacted document `SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
