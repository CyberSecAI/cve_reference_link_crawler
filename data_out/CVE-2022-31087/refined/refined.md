Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31087

**Description:** Incorrect Default Permissions

**Root Cause:**
The `/tmp` directory, which is accessible via `/lam/tmp/`, allows the interpretation of PHP files.  The default permissions allowed execution of PHP scripts within this directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/tmp` directory had insufficient restrictions, allowing PHP files to be executed.
*   **Web Shell Execution:** The ability to execute PHP files in the `/tmp` directory allowed attackers to potentially upload and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who could write files to the `/tmp` directory using `www-data` privileges (or similar) could execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a PHP web shell. This would give the attacker control of the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Full Server Compromise:** Successful RCE could lead to the complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** Attackers need to be able to write files into the `/tmp` directory, typically through exploiting another vulnerability or having compromised user privileges.
*   **Web Request:** Once a PHP web shell is uploaded, attackers can access it through web requests and execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Write Access:** Attackers must be able to write files to the `/tmp` directory with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., `www-data`).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to send web requests to the server running the application.
*   **Local Access:** As per the CVSS vector, the attack vector is "Local". It means the attacker must have some local access, or the ability to write files in the local file system (e.g., via compromised credentials).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of LDAP Account Manager (LAM) prior to 8.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.0 of LDAP Account Manager.
*   **Workarounds:** The provided workaround suggests manually disallowing execution of PHP scripts in the affected directory.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the `/tmp` directory, specifically allowing the execution of PHP files, which allowed attackers with write access to this folder to achieve remote code execution on the server.
