- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WappPress plugin is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows a malicious actor to cause the website to execute requests to an arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially find sensitive information of other services running on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the SSRF vulnerability, an attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary domains.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable plugin. The required privilege is a subscriber.
