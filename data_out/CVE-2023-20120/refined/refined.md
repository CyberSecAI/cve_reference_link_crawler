{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of user input in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed when a user interacts with the affected interface.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to persuade a user to click a crafted link after injecting the malicious script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated remote attacker is required to inject the malicious script. Subsequently, another user must click a crafted link."
