The provided content is related to CVE-2024-1286.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the "Paid Memberships Pro - Membership Maps Add On" plugin. Specifically, it doesn't prevent users with Contributor roles or higher from accessing and exposing sensitive information about other users with memberships.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to sensitive user information, allowing unauthorized users (Contributors and higher) to view it.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The plugin's shortcode allows the display of user details such as login names, user IDs, and user levels, which should not be accessible to lower-level users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers (or any user with Contributor role and above) can expose sensitive user data, potentially leading to privacy breaches and further security risks. The data includes user login names, user IDs, and user levels.
- **Unauthenticated access:** If a post containing the malicious shortcode is published, this information becomes available to anyone, even unauthenticated users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via the plugin's shortcode. A Contributor-level user can add the shortcode to any post/page to reveal sensitive information
- Public disclosure through published posts containing the shortcode, allowing unauthenticated access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a user account with at least the Contributor role on a WordPress site that has the vulnerable plugin installed.
- Alternatively, any user, even unauthenticated can view exposed information if a post/page containing the malicious shortcode is published.
