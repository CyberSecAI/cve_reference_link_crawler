## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Paid Memberships Pro - Membership Maps Add On < 0.7 - Contributor+ Sensitive Information Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with at least the contributor role from leaking sensitive information about users with a membership on the site.

### Proof of Concept

1. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro
2. ADMIN: Install Paid Memberships Pro Membership Maps Add On
3. CONTRIBUTOR: Add shortcode to any post and save
4. CONTRIBUTOR: Preview the post and see list of all members for a site and see it lists sensitive user information including user level etc
5. ANYONE: If the post/page ends up being published with the shortcode, anyone without authentication can see the exposed details
Example shortcode: `[pmpro\_membership\_maps fields="Login,user\_login;User ID,ID;User level,wp\_user\_level"]`
