The content is related to CVE-2024-24907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Filters page of Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the application's data store. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
When a victim user accesses the data store through their browser, the malicious code is executed in the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to:
* Information disclosure
* Session theft
* Client-side request forgery

**Attack vectors:**
An adjacent network high privileged attacker can inject malicious code into the Filters page. When another user accesses the filters page in their browser, the malicious script will execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network and have high privileges within the Dell Secure Connect Gateway (SCG) Policy Manager. The attacker also needs to get a victim to access the filters page after they have injected the malicious code.
