Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `forgot-password.php` endpoint of the PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal 1.0. Specifically, the "username" parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the "username" parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to databases: Attackers can bypass authentication and gain direct access to the database.
- Data theft: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
- Other malicious activities:  The injection could potentially be used to perform other attacks based on the database setup.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `username` parameter in the `/admin/forgot-password.php` endpoint.
- Attackers can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code via this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/forgot-password.php`).
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload to inject into the parameter

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker can exploit it without valid credentials.
- The vulnerability was tested on multiple browsers, and can be exploited using SQLmap.
- The `email` parameter is mentioned as a vulnerable parameter in the description of how to use SQLmap, however, the primary vulnerable parameter appears to be username.

The provided information confirms that the vulnerability is an SQL injection in the forgot password page of the mentioned application.
