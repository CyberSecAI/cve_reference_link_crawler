| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2222903#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-14 12:26:17 UTC  ``` The keylime attestation verifier fails to flag a device's submitted TPM quote as faulty when the quote's signature does not validate for some reason. Instead, it will only emit an error in the log but not flag the device as being untrusted.  To exploit this bug, a non-privileged user would have to modify the keylime agent to create invalid quotes a could then use invalid measurement lists to hide the trust state of a system. He would then have to trick the administrator in using the user's modified keylime agent.  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/keylime/keylime/commit/95ce3d86bd2c53009108ffda2dcf553312d733db>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2222903#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-14 12:40:38 UTC  ``` Created keylime tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2222908](show_bug.cgi?id=2222908 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-3674 keylime: attestation failure when the quote's signature does not validate [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2222903#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-03-05 18:12:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:1139 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1139](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1139)   ``` |  |
