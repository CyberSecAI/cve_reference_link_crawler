Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `formWriteFacMac` function within the Tenda AC7 V1.0 firmware.
*   The `mac` parameter, provided by the user, is directly passed to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system through the `mac` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including but not limited to, gaining complete control of the device, data exfiltration, denial of service, or further propagation of attacks within the network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `mac` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically requires the attacker to be on the same network as the device or have network access to the device's web interface.

**Additional details:**

*   The affected firmware version is Tenda AC7V1.0 V15.03.06.44.
*   A Proof-of-Concept (POC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to inject commands using a Python script and sending a crafted HTTP POST request. The provided example shows the `ls` command being injected.
