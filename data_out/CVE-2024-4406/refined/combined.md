| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Pro 13](https://www.mi.com/global/product/xiaomi-13-pro/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Xiaomi Pro 13 smartphones. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the integral-dialog-page.html file. When parsing the integralInfo parameter, the process does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | According to Xiaomi, ZDI-CAN-22332 was addressed in GetApps 32.0.0.1. Xiaomi informed ZDI they would assign a CVE, but never followed through. |
