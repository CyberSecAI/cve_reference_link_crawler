{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists because the `integral-dialog-page.html` file does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when parsing the `integralInfo` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can inject an arbitrary script by providing malicious user-supplied data in the `integralInfo` parameter. User interaction is required. The target user must visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input that can be accessed by the affected application through a malicious page or file. The attacker has to be remote."
