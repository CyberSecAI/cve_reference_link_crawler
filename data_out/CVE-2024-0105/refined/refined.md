- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of insufficient privileges in NVIDIA ConnectX Firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of insufficient privileges (CWE-274).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service, data tampering, and limited information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), requiring the attacker to be on the same network segment. The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning the exploit is straightforward to execute. The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L). No user interaction is required (UI:N). The scope is changed (S:C), indicating that the vulnerability affects resources beyond the attacker's control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges and be on the same network segment as the target device.
