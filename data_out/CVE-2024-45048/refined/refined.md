Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45048

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on the encoding declaration within XML files processed by PHPSpreadsheet. The regex used to extract the encoding `'/encoding="(.*?)"/'` could be easily bypassed using a single quote `'` in place of the double quotes. This allowed for the injection of a malicious encoding declaration such as `encoding='UTF-7'`. The application failed to correctly handle this encoding, leading to the bypass of custom entity sanitization and allowing for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is that by controlling the encoding and inserting a malicious DOCTYPE declaration, an attacker can trigger XXE.
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The regular expression used for encoding detection was inadequate, allowing bypass with single quotes.
- **Improper Handling of XML Encoding:** The library did not properly handle non-UTF-8 encodings, which could allow for the bypass of entity detection mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** An attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability to read local files on the server where the PHPSpreadsheet library is running. This is achieved using php-wrappers in the external entity declaration to access local files.
- **Information Disclosure:** By reading sensitive files, an attacker can gain access to confidential data.
- **Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  While not explicitly stated, LFI can sometimes be a stepping stone to RCE, depending on the specifics of the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of a maliciously crafted XLSX file.
- The attacker modifies the `sharedStrings.xml` (or other XML files within the XLSX archive) to include a malicious XML DOCTYPE declaration with a custom entity and sets a non UTF-8 encoding using single quotes to bypass the encoding check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft malicious XLSX files:** The attacker needs to create a modified XLSX file containing the malicious XML payload.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must open/process the maliciously crafted XLSX file using the vulnerable version of PHPSpreadsheet on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of PHPSpreadsheet:
  - >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.1
  - < 1.29.1
  - >= 2.0.0, < 2.1.1
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions:
  - 2.2.1
  - 1.29.1
  - 2.1.1
- The fix involves:
   - Modifying the `findCharSet` method to correctly identify encoding declarations using both double and single quotes `/encoding="([^"]\*]?)"/` and `/encoding='([^']\*?)'/`
   - Detecting double-encoded XML by adding an additional check to abort loading if an encoding different than UTF-8 is found after an initial conversion
