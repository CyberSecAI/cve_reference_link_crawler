Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the REST API endpoint of the "Simple Restrict" plugin. This allows unauthorized access to restricted content via the REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user permissions when accessing content through the REST API. Specifically, the `rest_restrict` function in `public/class-simple-restrict-public.php` does not fully enforce the same restrictions applied to regular page views.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Due to the missing authorization, an attacker can retrieve post titles and content that should be restricted based on user permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Content:** Attackers can bypass the plugin's access restrictions and view content they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information within restricted posts can be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API:** The primary attack vector is through the WordPress REST API. By sending a request to the API endpoint, an attacker can retrieve restricted content, if they know the post ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, but they do not need any special permissions.

**Technical Details:**

* The `rest_restrict` function in `public/class-simple-restrict-public.php` was modified to include a basic check to prevent access to restricted posts if the user does not have the 'edit_posts' capability. However, this check is insufficient as it doesn't take into account the specific permissions set by the plugin.
* The vulnerability exists in versions 1.2.6 and earlier of the plugin.
* Version 1.2.7 of the plugin addresses this vulnerability.

**Summary of Changes in Version 1.2.7 (from the provided changeset):**

* A new filter `rest_prepare_page` was added to apply the restriction logic to the REST API.
*  The `rest_restrict` function in  `public/class-simple-restrict-public.php` is added to filter REST API responses. This function sends a 403 error if a user does not have access to restricted content via the API, after checking if the user has the `edit_posts` capability, if not, it returns a 403 error, which is sent as JSON. This check is still not sufficient.
* Minor changes were made to the `README.txt` to reflect the new version and that a security issue was fixed.
