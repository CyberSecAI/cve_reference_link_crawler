The Blockspare: Gutenberg Blocks & Patterns for Blogs, Magazines, Business Sites – Post Grids, Sliders, Carousels, Counters, Page Builder & Starter Site Imports, No Coding Needed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in the ‘blockspare_render_social_sharing_block’ function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
