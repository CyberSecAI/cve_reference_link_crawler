Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition that exists in the way anti-virus (AV) software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel mode hooks to implement security features in the Windows operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability arises from a race condition during the execution of code. The AV software inspects code before execution. However, an attacker can leverage the fact that the AV software is often running on multi-core processors and is unable to track other threads. The attacker introduces a benign code sample, which is approved by AV. Just before execution, the attacker switches the benign code with a malicious payload. Due to the race condition, the AV software is unable to detect this switch, allowing the malicious code to execute.
- **SSDT Hooking:** AV products using SSDT hooks or other similar kernel-mode hooks are vulnerable.
- **Bypassing AV Detection:** The technique bypasses signature-based detection methods used by AV software, as the initial code sample is not malicious and passes security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass AV Protection:** The primary impact is the ability to bypass the protection offered by the majority of Windows desktop security products. This allows malware to execute without being detected.
- **Malware Installation:** Malware can be installed on a system despite the presence of AV software.
- **Disable AV:** An attacker could potentially disable the installed AV software using this technique, even from a limited user account.
- **Complete compromise:** A successful attack would lead to a complete compromise of the system, allowing malware to install, execute, and potentially steal data or perform other malicious activities, essentially rendering the protection offered by the product moot

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a binary on the target system.
- **Code Injection:** The attacker uses a benign code sample and replaces it with a malicious one prior to execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Run a Binary:** The attacker must have the ability to run a binary on the targeted machine.
- **Timing Control:** The attacker must be able to accurately time the swap of benign code to malicious code.
- **Knowledge of System Calls:** Attackers need to understand how SSDT hooks are used by the AV software and how to manipulate them.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
- The attack works even when Windows is running under an account with limited privileges.
- The technique isn't ideal for shellcode-based attacks or attacks requiring speed and stealth, as it requires loading a considerable amount of code.
- The attack can be combined with exploits of other software (e.g., Adobe Reader, Java) to install malware.
- A user without administrative rights could use the attack to disable an installed and running AV.
- The researchers tested 34 products which they determined to be vulnerable. They state that if they had more time, the list would be endless.
- F-Secure acknowledges the vulnerability but points out that their multi-layered approach provides sufficient protection and that they can add a signature to detect the attack.

This information provides a much more detailed picture of the vulnerability than a simple CVE description typically provides.
