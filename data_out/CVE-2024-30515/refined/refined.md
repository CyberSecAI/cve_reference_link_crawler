- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the lack of proper authorization, authentication or nonce checks allows unauthorized access to higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that they should not be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function that lacks proper access control, enabling a subscriber or other unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-level users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be a subscriber or other user that has lower privileges than the intended user for the vulnerable action.
