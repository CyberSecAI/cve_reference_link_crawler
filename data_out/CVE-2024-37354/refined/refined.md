  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition between fsync and a size-extending write operation on a Btrfs file involving preallocated extents can lead to overlapping extent items in the log tree. This occurs because btrfs_log_prealloc_extents() unlocks the filesystem tree while iterating, allowing concurrent modifications that insert overlapping extents.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Inconsistent state during tree modification",
      "Lack of proper synchronization when logging preallocated extents during fsync",
      "Overlapping extents in the log tree"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to duplicate keys in `btrfs_set_item_key_safe()`, leading to a denial of service. The specific error is a kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/ctree.c:2620.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Concurrent operations involving fsync and size-extending writes",
      "Direct I/O to trigger the race condition",
      "Setting xattr to enable BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING flag"

    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to perform file I/O operations, including fsync, direct writes, and setting xattrs on a Btrfs filesystem."

    "vulnerable_function": "btrfs_log_prealloc_extents",

    "sequence_of_events": [
      "File has i_size=4k, a regular extent from 0-4k, and prealloc extent from 4k-12k.",
      "First fsync copies inode and extent items to the log tree.",
      "An xattr is set, which enables the BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING flag.",
      "A direct I/O write extends i_size to 8k, while ordered extent is still in flight.",
      "Second fsync calls copy_inode_items_to_log(), which calls btrfs_log_prealloc_extents().",
      "btrfs_log_prealloc_extents() finds the 4k-12k extent, skips it since it's before i_size, calls btrfs_next_leaf().",
      "btrfs_next_leaf() unlocks the tree.",
      "Ordered extent completion converts 4k-8k to written, inserts 8k-12k prealloc part.",
      "btrfs_next_leaf() searches, finds the new 8k-12k prealloc extent.",
      "btrfs_log_prealloc_extents() copies the 8k-12k extent to log tree (overlapping with 4k-12k from the first fsync).",
      "fsync calls btrfs_log_changed_extents(), attempting to log written 4k-8k extent.",
       "This tries to drop 4k-8k in the log tree which requires adjusting the start of 4k-12k to 8k.",

    "fix": "The fix involves truncating overlapping file extent items in the log tree when such overlaps are detected before insertion using `truncate_inode_items`."
