  - The root cause is not specified in detail, but the description states it is related to an issue in the handling of SOCKS proxies in libcurl which could lead to an information leak

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Disclosure of sensitive information
  -  Potentially arbitrary code execution when SOCKS is used (from Gentoo)

**Attack vectors:**

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker does not need prior authentication (PR:N)
  - The attack complexity is low (AC:L)
  - The attacker is not required to interact with the user (UI:N)
  - The attacker needs to send malicious input that triggers the vulnerability through curl

**Additional details:**
  - The vulnerability is present in a number of NetApp products using the vulnerable versions of libcurl
  - macOS Ventura 13.3 also includes a fix for this vulnerability, updating the curl library
  - Gentoo also issued a security advisory that was fixed in version 8.3.0-r2
