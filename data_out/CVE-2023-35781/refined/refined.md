- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LWS Cleaner plugin for WordPress versions 2.3.0 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to execute actions with the privileges of a logged-in user, which could result in unwanted changes to the website or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that target the vulnerable plugin and are triggered by a user who is already authenticated to the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious request, which could be done through social engineering or by hosting the malicious request on a website controlled by the attacker.
