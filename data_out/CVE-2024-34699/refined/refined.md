The provided content is related to CVE-2024-34699.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically within team names. Markdown rendering was enabled for notices triggered by submitting a flag, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML code through crafted team names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.
- Improper Input Handling: The application did not properly sanitize or encode user-provided team names before displaying them, allowing for the injection of HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that, when displayed to other users, would execute in their browsers. This could lead to a wide range of impacts including:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user without their knowledge or consent.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious Team Name Creation: An attacker would create a team with a crafted name containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unprivileged User: Any unprivileged user could create teams and inject malicious code, thus any authenticated user of the application could exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves disabling markdown rendering for notices triggered by submitting a flag.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, rated as High severity due to the potential impact of XSS attacks and the low skill/privilege required for exploitation.
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 0.20.0 and patched in version 0.20.1.
- The commit `31e775b65cddf82a567d68dcdc78c1739b746346` fixes the issue.
- The vulnerability was found by `weyung` and remediated by `GZTimeWalker`.
- The content also shows that the application uses `InlineMarkdownRender` component, which is the source of the XSS issue before the fix.
