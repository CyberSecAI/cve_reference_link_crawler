Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The code reads beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This can result in information disclosure as the program attempts to access data that is not part of the intended memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability can lead to a heap buffer overread, potentially leading to information disclosure. The data read out of bounds could contain sensitive information, depending on what data is stored in adjacent heap memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the processing of malicious Lua code. The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing or interpretation of crafted Lua code that leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious Lua code on the affected system. This could involve exploiting a vulnerable application that uses the Lua interpreter or by tricking a user into running a malicious Lua script.

**Additional Information:**
*   The fix was included in Lua version 5.4.4-3, as noted in the Fedora and Gentoo advisories.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in upstream bug fixes (3, 4, and 5) against the 5.4.4 version.
*   The fix for this CVE is related to commit `1f3c6f4` in the Lua source code repository. This commit addresses an issue where Lua could generate incorrect code when `_ENV` is constant, which could be related to the overread.
