- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A problem with a protection mechanism in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Origin Validation Error (CWE-346). The vulnerability allows a local low-privileged user to disrupt some agent functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, low-privileged Windows user can disrupt some functionality of the Cortex XDR agent, although they cannot disrupt the agent's protection mechanisms using this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access on a Windows device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local, low-privileged access to the Windows machine where the vulnerable Cortex XDR agent is installed.
