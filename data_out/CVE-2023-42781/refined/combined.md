Subject: CVE-2023-42781: Apache Airflow: Permission verification bypass
 allows viewing dagruns of other dags

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.7.3

Description:

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.7.3, has a vulnerability that allows an authorized user who has access to read specific DAGs only, to read information about task instances in other DAGs.  This is a different issue than CVE-2023-42663 but leading to similar outcome.
Users of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.3 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.
