Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `ProcessBuilder` class in the `CmdUtil.runWindowsCmd` function. This function takes a command string, prepends "cmd /c", and then executes it. While it attempts to sanitize the input by replacing certain characters, this is insufficient, and allows for command injection. The vulnerability is specifically triggered via the `stamp` parameter in the `convertWord2PdfStamp` function within `ViewServiceImpl.class`, which is controllable by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The application constructs a command line string by directly embedding user-supplied input (the `stamp` parameter) without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The regular expression used for input sanitization `matches(". *["'&()^<>]. *")` is not robust enough to prevent command injection.
*   **Direct Execution of Unsanitized Input:** The application directly passes the constructed command string to `ProcessBuilder`, leading to code execution when an attacker provides malicious input.
*  **Exposed Endpoint:** The `/doc/{uuid}/pdf` endpoint does not properly sanitize the `stamp` parameter before using it in the command execution, making it directly exploitable.
*  **Default Token:** The use of a default token "testtoken" to upload files allows for easy exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the iDocView application. This can lead to a full compromise of the server.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data from the server or any other network resource accessible to the server.
*   **System Takeover:** An attacker could gain complete control of the server, leading to further attacks and malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/doc/{uuid}/pdf` endpoint.
*   **`stamp` Parameter:** The `stamp` parameter in the request's form data is used to inject malicious commands.
*   **Default Token:** The default token "testtoken" to upload files is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the iDocView server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/doc/{uuid}/pdf`) and the structure of the request.
*   **Ability to Upload File:** The attacker can exploit default token to upload a file and get the `uuid`.
*   **Command Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the command injection vulnerability and craft an appropriate payload, such as using `ping` to verify the vulnerability or execute more dangerous commands using `powershell`.
