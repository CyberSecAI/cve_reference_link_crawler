{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application directly embeds the `$username` parameter from a POST request into an SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries. This allows for SQL injection by manipulating the input string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection Vulnerability",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Direct embedding of user-controlled input into SQL queries"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to full compromise of the database, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary database commands.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/index.php`",
      "Manipulating the `username` parameter in the POST request"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to bypass authentication using SQL injection, and also suggests a fix using parameterized queries. The vulnerability is present in the `index.php` file."
