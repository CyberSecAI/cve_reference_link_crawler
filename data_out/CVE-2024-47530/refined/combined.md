# Open Redirect on Login via `next`

Moderate

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=4.88.1

## Patched versions

4.89

## Description

### Summary

Open redirect vulnerability allows performing phishing attacks on users by redirecting them to malicious page.

`/login` API endpoint is vulnerable to open redirect attack via `next` parameter due to absence of sanitization logic.

Additionally, due to lack of scheme validation, HTTPS Downgrade Attack can be performed on the users.

*Note: This vulnerability was found by the SAST tool I am current on the development.*

### Details

In `/login` API endpoint, `next` value from parameter is stored in `session["next_url"]`.

[scout/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout/blob/6a52248f53dbecc322dd18e9943af8cd04dacfe2/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py#L46-L54)

Lines 46 to 54
in
[6a52248](/Clinical-Genomics/scout/commit/6a52248f53dbecc322dd18e9943af8cd04dacfe2)

|  | @login\_bp.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"]) |
| --- | --- |
|  | @public\_endpoint |
|  | def login(): |
|  | """Login a user if they have access.""" |
|  | if "next" in request.args: |
|  | session["next\_url"] = request.args["next"] |
|  |  |
|  | user\_id = None |
|  | user\_mail = None |

Upon completing login process, `perform_login` function will be returned.

[scout/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout/blob/6a52248f53dbecc322dd18e9943af8cd04dacfe2/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py#L97)

|  | return perform\_login(user\_dict) |
| --- | --- |

If the user is successfully logged in, the user will be redirect based on parameter from `next`, `next_url` from session or default url.

Since in the previous step, we have `next` value stored in `next_url`, this may be used in performing the redirect.

[scout/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout/blob/6a52248f53dbecc322dd18e9943af8cd04dacfe2/scout/server/blueprints/login/views.py#L130-L136)

Lines 130 to 136
in
[6a52248](/Clinical-Genomics/scout/commit/6a52248f53dbecc322dd18e9943af8cd04dacfe2)

|  | def perform\_login(user\_dict): |
| --- | --- |
|  | if login\_user(user\_dict, remember=True): |
|  | flash("you logged in as: {}".format(user\_dict.name), "success") |
|  | next\_url = session.pop("next\_url", None) |
|  | return redirect(request.args.get("next") or next\_url or url\_for("cases.index")) |
|  | flash("sorry, you could not log in", "warning") |
|  | return redirect(url\_for("public.index")) |

This will result in the user being redirected to the malicious site.

### PoC

1. Visit the the PoC link like below where `hostname` replaced with the host the application is being served on.

```
http://[hostname]/login?next=https://example.com

```

2. You will be redirect to `http://[hostname]`. Login with your account.
3. Upon login, You will be redirect to the malicious page. In this PoC, it will be `https://example.com`.

scout\_poc.mov

### Impact

The attacker can redirect victims to the attacker controlled malicious website attempting to steal sensitive information from them.

Moreover, the attacker can attempt to perform HTTPS Downgrade Attack to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to steal sessions to perform account takeover etc.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
