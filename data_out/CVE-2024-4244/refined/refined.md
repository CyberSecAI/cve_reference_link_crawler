Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromDhcpSetSer` function within the Tenda W9 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking on the input parameters in the `fromDhcpSetSer` function. Specifically, the following parameters are susceptible to overflowing a stack buffer: `dhcpStartIp`, `dhcpEndIp`, `dhcpGw`, `dhcpMask`, `dhcpLeaseTime`, `dhcpDns1`, and `dhcpDns2`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a crafted request to the `/goform/DhcpSetSer` endpoint, likely through HTTP. The vulnerable parameters within this request would need to be crafted such that they overflow the stack buffer in the `fromDhcpSetSer` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Tenda W9 device, either by being on the same network or by having the device exposed to the internet.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the device's API and the format of the request parameters, specifically the parameters that are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Tenda W9 firmware version V1.0.0.7(4456).
- The information is based on a submission to vuldb.com and an analysis of source code hosted on GitHub.
