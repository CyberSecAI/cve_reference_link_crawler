- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The W3SPEEDSTER WordPress plugin versions 7.19 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions being performed within the WordPress site, with the same privileges as the targeted user. The specific impact depends on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious link or webpage that forces an authenticated user's browser to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site, as the exploit uses the existing authentication of the targeted user.
