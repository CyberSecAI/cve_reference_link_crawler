{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect comparison of table flags during updates in the netfilter nf_tables module. The code was comparing the provided flags directly with the table's flags, instead of comparing the provided flags with a masked version of the table's flags. This incorrect comparison prevented transactions from being skipped when the flags weren't actually modified.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect flag comparison during table updates."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact was that transactions were not being skipped when table flags were not modified, potentially leading to unnecessary operations and resource consumption, although the practical impact was likely minimal.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability could be triggered by any process attempting to update an nf_tables table using the API. An attacker would need to have the necessary privileges to perform table updates.",
        "The specific commit addresses the issue by modifying the flag comparison logic."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
       "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the netfilter nf_tables subsystem and have the privileges necessary to update tables."
    ]
