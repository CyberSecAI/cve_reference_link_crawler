Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2653:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `amphp/http` library collects HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames into an unbounded buffer.
- It does not check the header size limit until the `END_HEADERS` flag is received. This allows an attacker to send a large number of CONTINUATION frames without completing the header block.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unbounded buffer:** The lack of a limit on the buffer used to store CONTINUATION frames.
- **Missing header size check:** The header size limit check is performed too late, after the potentially malicious headers have already been buffered, making it ineffective in preventing this issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is an out-of-memory (OOM) crash, making the service unavailable. This can also result in CPU exhaustion if HPACK Huffman encoded CONTINUATION frames are sent, due to the overhead of decoding each frame.
- **High Availability Impact**: The CVSS score indicates a High Availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** An attacker can send a stream of malicious HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames to a vulnerable server over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the target server.
- The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests and craft malicious `CONTINUATION` frames.

**Additional Details:**

- `amphp/http-client` and `amphp/http-server` are also vulnerable if they use affected versions of `amphp/http`.
- Older versions of `amphp/http-client` (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are directly vulnerable due to their own handling of `CONTINUATION` frames.
- The vulnerability is related to improper handling of HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` frames, not specific to amphp/http. Other implementations of HTTP/2 are also affected (CVEs mentioned in openwall.com document).

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation).
