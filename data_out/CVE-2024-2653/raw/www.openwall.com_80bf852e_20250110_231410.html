Subject: CERT/CC VU#421644: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames can be utilized for DoS
 attacks

<a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644" rel="nofollow">https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644</a> announces:

&gt; HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames can be utilized for DoS attacks
&gt; ==========================================================
&gt; 
&gt; Vulnerability Note VU#421644
&gt; Original Release Date: 2024-04-03 | Last Revised: 2024-04-03
&gt; 
&gt; Overview
&gt; --------
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP allows messages to include named fields in both header and
&gt; trailer sections. These header and trailer fields are serialised as
&gt; field blocks in HTTP/2, so that they can be transmitted in multiple
&gt; fragments to the target implementation. Many HTTP/2 implementations do
&gt; not properly limit or sanitize the amount of CONTINUATION frames sent
&gt; within a single stream. An attacker that can send packets to a target
&gt; server can send a stream of CONTINUATION frames that will not be
&gt; appended to the header list in memory but will still be processed and
&gt; decoded by the server or will be appended to the header list, causing
&gt; an out of memory (OOM) crash.
&gt; 
&gt; Description
&gt; -----------
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP/2 utilizes header fields within HTTP request and response
&gt; messages. Header fields can comprise header lists, which in turn are
&gt; broken into header blocks. These header blocks are transmitted in
&gt; multiple fragments to the target implementation. HTTP/2 CONTINUATION
&gt; frames are used to continue a sequence of field block fragments. They
&gt; are utilized in order to split header blocks across multiple
&gt; frames. The other two types of header block fragments are HEADERS or
&gt; PUSH_PROMISE. CONTINUATION frames can be utilized to continue a header
&gt; block fragment that could not be transmitted by the HEADERS or
&gt; PUSH_PROMISE frames. A header block is considered completed when the
&gt; server receives a set END_HEADERS flag. This is intended to denote
&gt; that there are no further CONTINUATION, HEADERS, or PUSH_PROMISE
&gt; frames. A vulnerability has been discovered within multiple
&gt; implementations that does not limit the amount of CONTINUATION frames
&gt; that can be sent within a single stream.
&gt; 
&gt; The implementation will continue to receive frames as long as the
&gt; END_HEADERS flag is not set during these communications. An attacker
&gt; can initialize a connection to a server with typical HTTP/2 frames and
&gt; then receive initial frames from the server. The attacker can then
&gt; begin an HTTP request with no set END_HEADERS flags. This can allow an
&gt; attacker to send a stream of CONTINUATION frames to the target server,
&gt; which can result in an out-of-memory crash, enabling an attacker to
&gt; launch a denial of service (DoS) attack against a target server using
&gt; a vulnerable implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, an attacker can send HPACK Huffman encoded CONTINUATION
&gt; frames to a target implementation. This can cause CPU resource
&gt; exhaustion and result in a DoS as the the CPU must decode every
&gt; encoded frame that it receives.
&gt; 
&gt; Below are several CVE listings to reflect the vulnerability within
&gt; different implementations.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-27983
&gt; 
&gt; An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server unavailable by sending
&gt; a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames
&gt; inside. It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after
&gt; reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the
&gt; server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client
&gt; triggering the Http2Session destructor while header frames are still
&gt; being processed (and stored in memory) causing a race condition.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-27919
&gt; 
&gt; Envoy's oghttp codec does not reset a request when header map limits
&gt; have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of
&gt; CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited
&gt; memory consumption.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-2758
&gt; 
&gt; Tempesta FW rate limits are not enabled by default. They are either
&gt; set too large to capture empty CONTINUATION frames attacks or too
&gt; small to handle normal HTTP requests appropriately.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-2653
&gt; 
&gt; amphp/http will collect HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames in an unbounded
&gt; buffer and will not check the header size limit until it has received
&gt; the END_HEADERS flag, resulting in an OOM crash. amphp/http-client and
&gt; amphp/http-server are indirectly affected if they're used with an
&gt; unpatched version of amphp/http. Early versions of amphp/http-client
&gt; with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are also directly affected.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2023-45288
&gt; 
&gt; The Go packages net/http and net/http2 packages do not limit the
&gt; number of CONTINUATION frames read for an HTTP/2 request, which
&gt; permits an attacker to provide an arbitrarily large set of headers for
&gt; a single request, that will be read, decoded, and subsequently
&gt; discarded, which may result in excessive CPU consumption.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-28182
&gt; 
&gt; An implementation using the nghttp2 library will continue to receive
&gt; CONTINUATION frames, and will not callback to the application to allow
&gt; visibility into this information before it resets the stream,
&gt; resulting in a DoS.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-27316
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS flag set can be
&gt; sent in a continuous stream by an attacker to an Apache Httpd
&gt; implementation, which will not properly terminate the request early.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-31309
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to
&gt; consume more resources on the server. Version from 8.0.0 through
&gt; 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected.
&gt; 
&gt; CVE-2024-30255
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions 1.29.2 or earlier are
&gt; vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION
&gt; frames. Envoys HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited
&gt; number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoys header map
&gt; limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION
&gt; frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization,
&gt; consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; Impact
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker
&gt; the capability to launch DoS attacks against servers utilizing
&gt; vulnerable implementations.
&gt; 
&gt; Solution
&gt; --------
&gt; 
&gt; Different HTTP/2 implementations may have separate, unique
&gt; vulnerabilities specific to that implementation. It is important to
&gt; note that it may be difficult to analyze incoming malicious traffic
&gt; exploiting this vulnerability as the HTTP request is not properly
&gt; completed. Analysis of raw HTTP traffic may be necessary to determine
&gt; an attack utilizing this vulnerability.
