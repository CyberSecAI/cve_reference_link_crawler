```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `nodejs-undici` library failed to clear the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects when using `undici.request()`, `undici.dispatch()`, `undici.stream()` and `undici.pipeline()`. This is inconsistent with the behavior of `fetch()` which does clear such headers.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of sensitive headers during cross-origin redirects. The `Proxy-Authorization` header, which should not be sent to a different origin, was being forwarded.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could potentially expose proxy authentication credentials if they can induce a cross-origin redirect. This would allow the attacker to potentially use the victim's credentials to access protected resources of the proxy server.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered during HTTP redirects, specifically cross-origin redirects. An attacker would need to control the redirect target to have the victim's application make a request to a malicious destination via the controlled redirect.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be able to influence the redirection target of the request made by the vulnerable `nodejs-undici` client. This could involve a compromised server or a crafted response that causes the client to redirect to an attacker controlled server. The attacker requires high privileges to set headers, and the user has to interact with a malicious redirect.
