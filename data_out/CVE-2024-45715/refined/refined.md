**Root cause of vulnerability:** The SolarWinds Platform was susceptible to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user input when performing edit functions on existing elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the SolarWinds Platform.
*   The injected scripts can potentially be used to steal user credentials, manipulate data, or redirect users to malicious websites.
*  The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when performing an edit function to existing elements within the SolarWinds Platform.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the edit function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker requires high privileges to access the edit function.
*   The user interface interaction is required for the attack to be successful.
