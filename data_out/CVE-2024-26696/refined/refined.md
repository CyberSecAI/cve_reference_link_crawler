Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a conditional wait for writeback completion in the `nilfs_page_mkwrite()` function within the NILFS2 file system. Specifically, the wait for writeback to complete was skipped if the backing device did not require stable writes. This allowed data to be modified during writeback.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition/Deadlock:** The conditional wait in `nilfs_page_mkwrite()` created a race condition. When `migrate_pages_batch()` (called by mbind()) locked a folio and waited for writeback, the nilfs2 log writer thread, which is responsible for completing the writeback, might try to lock the same folio in `nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()` leading to a deadlock.
- **Data Corruption:** Because the writeback was not guaranteed to be complete, the data could be modified during the writeback process, potentially leading to inconsistent data on the disk. This could also lead to log invalidation and failure during recovery after an unclean shutdown as the nilfs2 checksum verification logic assumes consistent log data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock can cause the system to hang.
- **Data Corruption:**  The data changes during writeback can lead to corrupted file system metadata and potentially data loss.
- **Recovery Failure:** Due to the data corruption issue, recovery during mount after an unclean shutdown may fail.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  A user or process could trigger the deadlock condition by utilizing `mbind()` with the nilfs2 file system, combined with activity that causes writeback, triggering the race condition.
-   A system crash or unclean shutdown could exacerbate the data corruption vulnerability, which might cause issues with system recovery.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must be able to trigger `mbind()` operations on a system using the nilfs2 file system.
-   The attacker must also be able to cause data to be written such that a writeback is triggered in the nilfs2 log writer thread.
-  No special privileges are explicitly required for the exploitation as the vulnerability stems from the interaction of kernel functionalities and file system specific operation, assuming a standard user can perform those actions, however it's also likely that root access would be required to trigger these edge cases reliably.

**Additional Details:**

The provided patches show that the fix involves changing `wait_for_stable_page(page)` to `wait_on_page_writeback(page)` in `nilfs_page_mkwrite()`. The code comment explicitly states that the writeback must always complete due to nilfs2's use of checksumming, regardless of the underlying device's stable write requirements. This ensures that the data is consistent and avoids deadlocks and data corruption.

The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE has been addressed in their security updates for multiple Linux kernel versions.
