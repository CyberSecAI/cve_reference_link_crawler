The provided content discusses a reported HTTP request splitting vulnerability in Zeek, but it is ultimately determined that Zeek is behaving as expected according to HTTP RFCs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The reporter claims that by sending a crafted HTTP POST request with embedded HTTP headers in the body, Zeek incorrectly splits the request into multiple log entries, leading to inaccurate security analysis. The vulnerability stems from the use of the `Content-Length` header to delimit HTTP messages, where multiple `Content-Length` headers or embedded HTTP messages in the body cause incorrect parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness lies in the fact that Zeek's HTTP parser relies on the `Content-Length` header to determine the boundaries of HTTP requests. When a crafted request includes multiple `Content-Length` headers, or what appears to be another HTTP request within the body, Zeek interprets this as multiple requests. The core problem is that the reported behavior is a direct consequence of how HTTP works - `Content-Length` defines the length of the request body and is used to determine the end of the request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The incorrect parsing leads to multiple log entries for a single HTTP request with incorrect data such as the HTTP method or URI. This could invalidate Zeek's HTTP-based security analysis, including its internal security plugins and any external tools that use Zeek's logs for security monitoring or analysis. This can cause errors in any analysis based on request quantity, such as HTTP flood detection.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing embedded HTTP headers or multiple `Content-Length` headers within the body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a system being monitored by Zeek. No special privileges are required.

**Additional notes:**
- The discussion revolves around whether Zeek should deviate from standard HTTP parsing behavior, and it is concluded that Zeek is correctly parsing the requests according to the HTTP RFCs, and that the reported behavior is a consequence of how HTTP itself works.
- The reporter initially claims that Wireshark parses the crafted request differently from Zeek, but this is later corrected.
- The discussion also considers what Zeek should do when multiple `Content-Length` headers are encountered, which is not explicitly defined in the RFCs and is deemed an undecidable parsing problem.
- The issue was ultimately closed with the label "Invalid / Nothing to do".
