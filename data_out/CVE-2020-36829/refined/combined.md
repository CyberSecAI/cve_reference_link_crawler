### @robrwo **[robrwo](/robrwo)** commented [Nov 7, 2020](#issue-738249411)

By immediately returning when the two strings are not the

same length, the function allows an attacker to guess the

length of the secret string using timing attacks.

This change uses a fix by [@jberger](https://github.com/jberger), based on [1].

This also updates the documentation to emphasize that the

secret string should be the second argument (although it's

not critical).

[1] <https://github.com/vadimdemedes/secure-compare/blob/master/index.js>

### Summary

This fixes a potential leak of the length of the secret string using timing attacks.

### Motivation

The secure\_compare function is not as secure as claimed.

### References

See discussion [#1599](https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/issues/1599).

Sorry, something went wrong.

Ok. Fixed.

I normally keep lines under 80 characters but wrongly assumed because of long lines for other sections that you weren't wrapping lines. I think a style guide would be useful, or (better yet) add a POD test that enforces style.

The practical guide is that there is a perltidy config in the repo which should be used for all contributions and code/doc styles in use should be adhered to when appropriate.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3846-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>              Arturo Borrero Gonzalez
June 28, 2024                                 <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Package        : libmojolicious-perl
Version        : 8.12+dfsg-1.1~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-36829

Mojolicious is a Perl Web Application Framework built around the familiar
Model-View-Controller philosophy. It supports a simple single file mode via
Mojolicious::Lite, RESTful routes, plugins, Perl-ish templates, session
management, signed cookies, a testing framework, internationalization, first
class Unicode support, and more.

The libmojolicious-perl package had a timing attack vulnerability that allowed
an attacker to guess the length of a secret string.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
8.12+dfsg-1.1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmojolicious-perl packages.

For the detailed security status of libmojolicious-perl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libmojolicious-perl>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| * Mojolicious version: 8.63 * Perl version: 5.28.1 * Operating system: Linux 4.15.0-122-generic 124-Ubuntu  Steps to reproduce the behavior I would expect the cumulative or code to short-circuit comparisons once r is true.  ``` $r |= ord(substr $one, $_) ^ ord(substr $two, $_) ```  I wrote a rudimentary benchmark:  ``` use strict; use warnings;  use Benchmark;  sub secure_compare {   my ($one, $two) = @_;   return undef if length $one != length $two;   my $r = 0;   $r |= ord(substr $one, $_) ^ ord(substr $two, $_) for 0 .. length($one) - 1;   return $r == 0; }   timethese( 5_000_000, {     diff1 => sub { secure_compare("aaaaaaaaaa", "baaaaaaaaa") },     diff5 => sub { secure_compare("aaaaaaaaaa", "aaaaabaaaa") },     diff9 => sub { secure_compare("aaaaaaaaaa", "aaaaaaaaab") },     same  => sub { secure_compare("aaaaaaaaaa", "aaaaaaaaaa") }, });  ```  It seems that the latter a difference occurs in a string, the longer the comparison takes:  ``` Benchmark: timing 5000000 iterations of diff1, diff5, diff9, same...      diff1:  9 wallclock secs ( 8.50 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.50 CPU) @ 588235.29/s (n=5000000)      diff5:  9 wallclock secs ( 8.57 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.57 CPU) @ 583430.57/s (n=5000000)      diff9:  8 wallclock secs ( 8.80 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.80 CPU) @ 568181.82/s (n=5000000)       same: 10 wallclock secs ( 8.84 usr +  0.00 sys =  8.84 CPU) @ 565610.86/s (n=5000000)  ```  So this does leak information about the strings. Expected behavior There should be no difference in the timing. Actual behavior The latter a difference occurs in a string, the longer the check takes. |

| Note running tests on different machines (different Linux versions) and different versions of Perl, the timings are less consistent, but generally diff1 takes less time than diff5 or diff9 or same. |

| Actually, this is bitwise or so it shouldn't short-circuit. Closing this as invalid, although I suspect there's something else going on that leads this to leak information about where the difference is. |

| I've run it many times on numerous machines, Perl 5.22.2, 5.28.1 and 5.30.3. I've found the following: diff1 is consistently less time than all others. Anyhow, I closed this when I realised that the ordering was not as consistent as it first appeared.  Also, because it immediately returns when the two strings do not have equal length, then it is possible to guess how long the string is. (Keep adding a character to string, and time the compare, then look for the comparison that took the most time.) |

| The purpose of the function is to avoid leaking information about a secret string to an attacker who is using the time it takes for the method to run.  Because the function exits quickly when the string lengths are unequal, it makes it easy to for the attacker to guess how long the secret string is. |

By immediately returning when the two strings are not the
same length, the function allows an attacker to guess the
length of the secret string using timing attacks.

This change uses a fix by @jberger, based on [1].

This also updates the documentation to emphasize that the
secret string should be the second argument (although it's
not critical).
