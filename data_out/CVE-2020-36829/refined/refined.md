Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `secure_compare` function in `Mojo::Util` had a timing vulnerability. The function would immediately return if the lengths of the two input strings were different. This allowed an attacker to infer the length of a secret string by observing the time it took for the function to execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The primary vulnerability was the susceptibility to timing attacks. By varying the length of an input string and measuring the execution time of `secure_compare`, an attacker could deduce the length of the secret string being compared.
- **Premature Exit:** The function's early exit when string lengths didn't match was the core issue enabling the timing attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker could learn the length of a secret string. This could be a prerequisite for further attacks if the secret string is a password, API key, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Timing Analysis:** By repeatedly calling the vulnerable function with different length inputs and measuring the execution time of the comparison.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the vulnerable `secure_compare` function with controlled input strings.
- The attacker also needs to measure the time it takes the `secure_compare` function to execute with reasonable accuracy.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involved modifying the function to always perform a comparison operation for the length of the longer string, even if lengths of strings are different. This prevents the timing differences that allowed the attack.
- The documentation was also updated to emphasize that the "secret" string should be the second argument, although this was not critical.
- The vulnerability was present in `libmojolicious-perl` prior to version `8.12+dfsg-1.1~deb10u1`.
