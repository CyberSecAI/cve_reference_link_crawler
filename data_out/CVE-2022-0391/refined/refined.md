Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `urllib.parse` module in Python not sanitizing URLs containing ASCII newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab (`\t`) characters. This allows an attacker to inject these characters into a URL path, which can lead to various attacks.
- Specifically, the issue arises because the `urlsplit` function does not remove these characters early enough in the parsing process. This leads to incorrect parsing and can allow these characters to be present in the URL components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `urllib.parse` module fails to properly sanitize URL inputs by stripping ASCII newline and tab characters.
- **Injection Attacks:** The vulnerability could be exploited by attackers injecting newline/tab characters into a crafted URL, which could lead to unintended or malicious behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  Addition or modification of data.
- Code injection attacks or other forms of attacks depending on the application using `urllib.parse` module

**Attack vectors:**

-   An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing newline/tab characters.
-   If the vulnerable `urllib.parse` module is used to parse and process the crafted URL, this can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to supply or influence the input of URLs processed by the vulnerable Python code using `urllib.parse`.
- The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The fix involves removing ASCII newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), and tab (`\t`) characters from the URL in the `urllib.parse` module.
- The fix was applied to multiple Python versions (3.11, 3.10, 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, 3.6).
- The vulnerability stems from not adhering strictly to the WHATWG specification for URLs, which requires stripping newlines and tabs
- The issue was also present in pypy3
- There were some discussion related to if the fix was intrusive to existing systems (where it was) and if new parameter controlling the behavior had to be added. However, it was concluded that the current fix is reasonable and new parameter can cause other problems down the line.
