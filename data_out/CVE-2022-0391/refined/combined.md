Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-18ad73aba6
2022-02-24 23:06:26.903922
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python2.7
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 2.7.18
Release : 20.fc35
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 2.7 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that Python 2 is not supported upstream after 2020-01-01, please use the
python3 package instead if you can.

This package also provides the "python2" executable.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [‚ÄúCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins‚Äù](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.¬† 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.¬† None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2022 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2844807.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2844807.1 ) .

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-ef99a016f6
2022-02-24 23:26:12.563251
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python2.7
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.7.18
Release : 20.fc34
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 2.7 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that Python 2 is not supported upstream after 2020-01-01, please use the
python3 package instead if you can.

This package also provides the "python2" executable.

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.16-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-23336 CVE-2022-0391 CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48565
                 CVE-2022-48566 CVE-2023-24329 CVE-2023-40217

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

CVE-2021-23336

    Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
    urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
    attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
    cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
    (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
    malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
    usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
    include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

CVE-2022-0391

    The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
    components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
    input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
    allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
    module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
    XML vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-48566

    An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
    Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
    variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-24329

    An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
    blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

CVE-2023-40217

    The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
    servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
    created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
    there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
    as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
    still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
    authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
    authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
    is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
    connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
    vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
    initialization of the SSLSocket.)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

|  |  | The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL allows for some |
|  |  | forms of attacks. Following the WHATWG specification that updates :rfc:`3986`, |
|  |  | ASCII newline ``\n``, ``\r`` and tab ``\t`` characters are stripped from the |
|  |  | URL by the parser in :mod:`urllib.parse` preventing such attacks. The removal |
|  |  | characters are controlled by a new module level variable |
|  |  | ``urllib.parse.\_UNSAFE\_URL\_BYTES\_TO\_REMOVE``. (See :issue:`43882`) |

### @orsenthil **[orsenthil](/orsenthil)** commented [Apr 25, 2021](#issue-867030163) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

[bpo-43882](https://bugs.python.org/issue43882): Strip ascii newline and tabs from the url input, following WHATWG specification

Presence newline or tab characters in URL allowed attackers to write scripts in URL, hijack the web-server.

Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by WHATWG urllib.parse strips ASCII newline and tabs from the url, preventing such attacks.

<https://bugs.python.org/issue43882>

Sorry, something went wrong.

Upgrade builds to OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

Also updates _ssl_data_111.h from OpenSSL 1.1.1u, _ssl_data_300.h from 3.0.9.

Manual edits to the _ssl_data_300.h file prevent it from removing any
existing definitions in case those exist in some peoples builds and were
important (avoiding regressions during backporting).

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit GH-25595.

This adds more sanitizing to respect the \"Remove any leading C0 control or space from input\" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/GH-url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

I simplified the docs by eliding the state of the world explanatory
paragraph in this security release only backport.  (people will see
that in the mainline /3/ docs)

Upgrade builds to OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

Also updates _ssl_data_111.h from OpenSSL 1.1.1u, _ssl_data_300.h from 3.0.9.

Manual edits to the _ssl_data_300.h file prevent it from removing any
existing definitions in case those exist in some peoples builds and were
important (avoiding regressions during backporting).

* [3.8] [pythongh-103142](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103142): Upgrade binary builds and CI to OpenSSL 1.1.1u ([pythonGH-105174](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105174)) ([pythonGH-105200](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105200)) ([pythonGH-105205](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105205)) ([python#105370](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105370))

Upgrade builds to OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

Also updates _ssl_data_111.h from OpenSSL 1.1.1u, _ssl_data_300.h from 3.0.9.

Manual edits to the _ssl_data_300.h file prevent it from removing any
existing definitions in case those exist in some peoples builds and were
important (avoiding regressions during backporting).

(cherry picked from commit [ede89af](https://github.com/DataDog/cpython/commit/ede89af605b1c0442353435ad22195c16274f65d))

* gh-102153: Start stripping C0 control and space chars in `urlsplit` (GH-102508)

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit GH-25595.

This adds more sanitizing to respect the \"Remove any leading C0 control or space from input\" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/GH-url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

Backported to Python 2 from Python 3.12.

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit GH-25595.

This adds more sanitizing to respect the \"Remove any leading C0 control or space from input\" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/GH-url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

| ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Buildbot failure ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Hi! The buildbot **x86 Gentoo Installed with X 3.7** has failed when building commit [f4dac7e](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f4dac7ec55477a6c5d965e594e74bd6bda786903).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/430/builds/4>) and take a look at the build logs. 4.

The buildbot **x86 Gentoo Non-Debug with X 3.7** has failed when building commit [f4dac7e](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f4dac7ec55477a6c5d965e594e74bd6bda786903).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/351/builds/4>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([f4dac7e](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f4dac7ec55477a6c5d965e594e74bd6bda786903)) or if it is a false positive. 5.

This goes to show that messing with security-critical code is a nasty
business and often a mistake. Luckily, we have tests, but what
happened here is that I tweaked the code to separate out checks from
redirection. In so doing, I removed pulled the quoting code into the
checks, but took it out of the redirection part. So previously, we'd
quote a URL before redirecting it, now we didn't.

To fix this, I copied the fix from Python's standard lib that you can
see here:

    https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25725/

Instead of quoting it, we just make sure it doesn't have newlines. If
it does, we bail.")`

| ``` A security issue was reported by Mike Lissner wherein an attacker was able to use `\r\n` in the url path, the urlparse method didn't sanitize and allowed those characters be present in the request.  > In [9]: from urllib.parse import urlsplit > In [10]: urlsplit("java\nscript:alert('bad')") > Out[10]: SplitResult(scheme='', netloc='', path="java\nscript:alert('bad')", query='', fragment='')    Firefox and other browsers ignore newlines in the scheme. From the browser console:  >> new URL("java\nscript:alert(bad)") << URL { href: "javascript:alert(bad)", origin: "null", protocol: "javascript:", username: "", password: "", host: "", hostname: "", port: "", pathname: "alert(bad)", search: ""   Mozilla Developers informed about the controlling specification for URLs is in fact defined by the "URL Spec" from WHATWG which updates RFC 3986 and specifies that tabs and newlines should be stripped from the scheme.  See: <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser>  That link defines an automaton for URL parsing. From that link, steps 2 and 3 of scheme parsing read:  If input contains any ASCII tab or newline, validation error. 3. Remove all ASCII tab or newline from input.  ----    urlparse module behavior should be updated, and an ASCII tab or newline should be removed from the url (sanitized) before it is sent to the request, as WHATWG spec. ``` | | | |

| ``` I think there's still a flaw in the fixes implemented in 3.10 and 3.9 so far.  We're closer, but probably not quite good enough yet.  why?  We aren't stripping the newlines+tab early enough.  I think we need to do the stripping *right after* the _coerce_args(url, ...) call at the start of the function.  Otherwise we   (1) are storing url variants with the bad characters in _parse_cache [a mere slowdown in the worst case as it'd just overflow the cache sooner]   (2) are splitting the scheme off the URL prior to stripping.  in 3.9+ there is a check for valid scheme characters, which will defer to the default scheme when found.  The WHATWG basic url parsing has these characters stripped before any parts are split off though, so 'ht\rtps' - for example - would wind up as 'https' rather than our behavior so far of deferring to the default scheme.  I noticed this when reviewing the pending 3.8 PR as it made it more obvious due to the structure of the code and would've allowed characters through into query and fragment in some cases.  <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25726#pullrequestreview-649803605> ``` | | | |

| ``` Good catch, Greg. Since it's not merged already, this change will miss 3.8.10 but as a security fix will be included in 3.8.11 later in the year.  The partial fix already landed in 3.9 will be released in 3.9.5 later today unless it's amended or reverted in a few hours. ``` | | | |

| ``` I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I've already found this change to be breaking tests of botocore and django.

| ``` Leaving a thought here, I'm highlighting that we're now implementing two different standards, RFC 3986 with hints of WHATWG-URL. There are pitfalls to doing so as now a strict URL parser for RFC 3986 (like the one used by urllib3/requests) will give different results compared to Python and thus opens up the door for SSRF vulnerabilities [1].

| ``` Both Django and Botocore issues appear to be in the category of: "depending on invalid data being passed through our urlsplit API so that they could look for it later"  Not much sympathy.  We never guaranteed we'd pass invalid data through.  They're depending on an implementation detail (Hyrum's law).  Invalid data causes other people who don't check for it problems.  There is no valid solution on our end within the stdlib that won't frustrate somebody.  We chose to move towards safer (undoubtedly not perfect) by default.  Instead of the patches as you see them, we could've raised an exception.  I'm sure that would also also have tripped up existing code depending on the undesirable behavior.  If one wants to reject invalid data as an application/library/framework, they need a validator.  The Python stdlib does not provide a URL validation API.  I'm not convinced we would even want to (though that could be something [issue43883](issue43883 "[open] Making urlparse WHATWG conformant") winds up providing) given how perilous that is to get right: Who's version of right? which set of standards? when and why? Conclusion: The web... such a mess. ``` | | | |

| ``` In my opinion, raising an exception would have been safer.  Botocore and django do precisely what you say ‚Äî provide a validator.  To make this validator easier, they do the validation on splitted up URL parts.  I disagree with the premise that they were stupid to rely on invalid data being passed through.  I could understand if the function started rejecting invalid data.  But until now, you could reasonably assume that urlsplit()'s output would correspond to its input.  Making the output 'sanitized' means that invalid input is converted into valid output.  This goes against the principle of least surprise.  In the end, this opens us potential vulnerabilities in other packages.  Imagine that something uses urlsplit() to perform the URL validation but uses the original URL elsewhere.  By making the validation happen on a sanitized URL, you're effectively disarming the validator and letting bad URL through.  Security is not only about fixing potential problems with your package.  It's also about considering the consequences to your users.  In this case, the chosen solution may actually open more vulnerabilities that it fixes.  What's even worse, you're actively harming security in projects that actually attempted to solve the same problem earlier. ``` | | | |

| ``` Thank you for the kind words Micha≈Ç. We (Django) are exactly in the position that you describe. Our validation, at least for now has to stay strict, exactly to prevent fallout further down the road (see <https://github.com/django/django/pull/14349#pullrequestreview-652022529> for details).  Sure, we might have been a bit naive when relying on urllib.parse for parts of our validation routines, but this is why we have tests for this behavior. We can easily work around this fix and will issue a release shortly to prevent security issues for users on newer Python versions. But no matter how the Python code ends up in the long run, our validator (at least this specific class) cannot simply accept new URLs because a spec changed. We owe it to our users to keep in mind that relaxing the validation can cause other issues down the road. ``` | | | |

| ``` Thanks Florian!  Indeed, I'm glad you have tests for this.  (I expect anyone writing their own validation code will have such tests)  Making urlsplit raise an exception where it never has before has other consequences:  In CPython's own test suite test_urllib fails as many of its tests for validation that these characters are either ignored or cause a specific http.client.InvalidURL error on urlopen() start failing.  I draw no conclusions from that other than we'd need to rework some of those tests.  It just reflects the state of our test suite and even inconsistent behavior between excluding the characters or erroring within the http.client code on them based on past CVEs.  Regardless, if people would people prefer to see urlsplit `raise SomeExistingException(f'Invalid characters in URL or scheme. url={url!r} scheme={scheme!r}')` in 3.9.6 and the security patch releases for other 3.x versions, evidence that it wouldn't cause alternate problems would be helpful.  I've kicked off tests at work on our huge codebase with both variants as a datapoint to see if that is informative or not.  If we went the exception route: SomeExistingException might make sense as `http.client.InvalidURL`, but that'd be a circular dependency (no big deal) and heavyweight import for urllib.parse to have.  `urllib.error.URLError` could also make sense, but that's an OSError descendant and identifies itself as a urlopen error which would be surprising.  `ValueError` is a reasonable fallback.  But using that guarantees someone will wonder why it isn't one of the other two...  As this is a bugfix, defining a new exception isn't an option.  We as a community currently lack a way for security patches to CPython to be tested against a broad swath of projects in advance of them appearing in a release.  Once upon a time there were release candidates for patches releases that could serve this purpose... ``` | | | |

| ``` > Instead of the patches as you see them, we could've raised an exception.  In my mind the definition of a valid URL is what browsers recognize. They're moving towards the WHATWG definition, and so too must we.   If we make python raise an exception when a URL has a newline in the scheme (e..g: "htt\np"), we'd be raising exceptions for *valid* URLs as browsers define them. That doesn't seem right at all to me. I'd be frustrated to have to catch such an exception, and I'd wonder how to pass through valid exceptions without urlparse raising something.   > Making the output 'sanitized' means that invalid input is converted into valid output.  This goes against the principle of least surprise.  Well, not quite, right? The URLs this fixes *are* valid according to browsers. Browsers say these tabs and newlines are OK.   ----  I agree though that there's an issue with the approach of stripping input in a way that affects output. That doesn't seem right.   I think the solution I'd favor (and I imagine what's coming in 43883) is to do this properly so that newlines are preserved in the output, but so that the scheme is also placed properly in the scheme attribute.   So instead of this (from the initial report):  > In [9]: from urllib.parse import urlsplit > In [10]: urlsplit("java\nscript:alert('bad')") > Out[10]: SplitResult(scheme='', netloc='', path="java\nscript:alert('bad')", query='', fragment='')  We get something like this:  > In [10]: urlsplit("java\nscript:alert('bad')") > Out[10]: SplitResult(scheme='java\nscript', netloc='', path="alert('bad')", query='', fragment='')  In other words, keep the funky characters and parse properly. ``` | | | |

| ``` Mike: There may be multiple ways to read that WHATWG recommendation?  The linked to section is about implementing a state machine for parsing a URL into parts safely.  But that may not imply that anything that passed through that state machine should be considered "valid".  Just that this spec is able to make some sense out of otherwise messy data.  Network adage: Be lenient in what you accept.  I doubt anyone would want something producing URLs for consumption by something else to allow these in their output.  I have yet to read the _entire_ WHATWG spec from head to toe to try and better understand the context they had in mind.  I agree that it is unfortunate that the original URL may have these issues and go on to be (re)used in another context where it passes to something that might not treat it in the same manner.  That's in some sense a flaw in our API design that we allow string based URLs to be used in APIs rather than require them to have gone through a parsing sanitization step into a instance of a URL object (for example). API design like that is clearly out of scope for this issue. :)  Regardless my gut feeling is that we continue with the existing fix that remove the characters as we've already started releasing.  If we need to change our mind on how we've done that, so be it, we can, that'll show up in later patches. ``` | | | |

| ``` Hey folks,  Thanks for all the work on this: I really appreciate the efforts to keep Python as secure as possible!  This change _is_ causing us problems in the cloud-init codebase, which thankfully have been caught by our testing in Ubuntu's development release.  This is in a fairly deep part of the codebase, so apologies in advance for the detailed description.  TL;DR: cloud-init constructs mirror URLs and then sanitises them by replacing invalid characters with hyphens.  With the fix for this bug, urlsplit silently removes (some of) those characters before we can replace them, modifying the output of our sanitisation code, and therefore meaning cloud-init will, albeit in fairly specific corner cases, configure different mirrors if run with a Python including this fix vs. one that precedes it.  cloud-init constructs mirror URLs based on applying cloud metadata to user-configured (or default) templates.  As we're responsible for constructing these URLs, we also sanitise them before configuring the package manager to use them: specifically, we urlsplit to get the hostname, IDNA-encode (to handle non-ASCII input), replace any invalid URL characters with a "-", and then strip "-" off each part of the hostname (to handle leading/trailing invalid characters), then recombine the URL.  The most common case for this is a cloud which specifies values for the variables used in the template with an underscore: <http://my_openstack_region.cloud.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu> causes Apache mirrors with the default "HTTPProtocolOptions Strict" configuration to reject all requests to them (as that's an invalid hostname).  In contrast, <http://my-openstack-region.cloud.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu> *is* accepted, so is preferable.  (This is important because *.cloud.archive.ubuntu.com exists so that local cloud admins can DNS "hijack" subdomains of it to point at internal servers: even though the Ubuntu mirrors don't reject underscored domains (any longer), this is a landmine waiting for any admins running their own mirrors.)  For more background, see the bug where we figured this all out: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1868232](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/%2Bbug/1868232)  So, more concretely: if we consider a post-templated URL of <http://my>\topenstack\tregion.mirror.internal/ubuntu, cloud-init changes from rewriting that to my-openstack-region.mirror.internal (on < 3.9.5) to myopenstackregion.mirror.internal (on 3.9.5+): if, in this notional deployment, an apt mirror is running at (exactly) my-openstack-region.mirror.internal, then new instance deployments will start failing: they won't be able to install packages.  This is the sort of breakage that we aim to avoid in cloud-init (because you just _know_ that everyone who deployed this cloud left NotionalCorp years ago, so fixing the configuration to remove these obviously-incorrect tabs is not necessarily trivial).  Given the current state of the fix here, it's not clear to me how we could (cleanly) achieve our desired behaviour.  We could perform replacement of these characters before invoking `urlsplit` but that would then substitute these characters outside of only the hostname: this is also a change in behaviour.  We could substitute those characters with magic strings, perform the split, and then replace them in the non-hostname parts with the original character and in the hostname with hyphens: we've obviously left "cleanly" behind at this point.  Another option would be to monkeypatch _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE to an empty list: again, not a solution I'd want to have to support across Python versions!  One solution that presents itself to me: add a `strip_insecure_characters: bool = True` parameter.  We, in cloud-init, would pass this in as `False`, knowing that we're going to handle those ourselves.  Of course, this does leave the door open for API users to keep the current insecure behaviour: if library code (either public or project-internal) were to default to `False`, then the situation is no better than today.  For our use case, at least, I think a more restricted solution would work: `url_replacement_char: str = ""`.  We'd call `urlsplit(..., url_replacement_char="-")` and the rest of our code would work as it does today: from its POV, there were never these invalid chars in the first place.   Thanks once again for the work (and apologies for the wall of text)!   Dan ``` | | | |

| ``` We try to not add a new parameter in a bugfix release as that can be difficult to use.  That said, adding a new bool keyword only parameter to control this behavior seems feasible.  Unfortunately you already have to deal with the existence of 3.9.5 having the new behavior but not having a control.  (maybe you resort to the global behavior change there by monkeypatching the list? removing tab is probably enough as I doubt you rely on newlines in your scenario?)  Code wanting to support versions before this patch _and pass that new parameter_ winds up needing to resort to inspect.signature(), or a call with the parameter, catch the NameError, and retry calling without it pattern.  Not unheard of.  And so long as most code doesn't ever need to do that trick, is fine.  (it can be checked for at module import time rather than doing it on every call to save overhead if that matters)  meta: Marking the issue as open while we decide if we'll be doing something here. ``` | | | |

| ``` >  With the fix for this bug, urlsplit silently removes (some of) those characters before we can replace them, modifying the output of our sanitisation code  I don't have any good solutions for 3.9.5, but going forward, this feels like another example of why we should just do parsing right (the way browsers do). That'd maintain tabs and whatnot in your output, and it'd fix the security issue by putting `java\nscript` into the scheme attribute instead of the path.  > One solution that presents itself to me: add a `strip_insecure_characters: bool = True` parameter.  Doesn't this lose sight of what this tool is supposed to do? It's not supposed to have a good (new, correct) and a bad (old, obsolete) way of parsing. Woe unto whoever has to write the documentation for that parameter.   Also, I should reiterate that these aren't "insecure" characters so if we did have a parameter for this, it'd be more like `do_rfc_3986_parsing` or maybe `do_naive_parsing`. The chars aren't insecure in themselves. They're fine. Python just gets tripped up on them. ``` | | | |

| ``` Of note: If we had chosen to raise a ValueError (or similar) for these characters by default, the cloud-init code would also fail to behave as intended today (based on what I see in <https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/commit/c478d0bff412c67280dfe8f08568de733f9425a1>)  Recommendation for cloud-init - Do your hostname transformation early using as simple as possible logic.  By virtue of accepting (and encouraging?) invalid characters and transforming them, what you have today that you call urlsplit on is more of a url template, not really a url.  something like this:  ``` if m := re.search(r'^(?P<scheme_colon_slashes>[^/:]+://|)(?P<hostname>[^/]+)(?P<rest>/.*)', url_template):     start, hostname, end = m.groups()     for transformation in transformations:         ... fixup hostname ...     url = f'{start}{hostname}{end}' else:     ... # doesn't look like a URL template ```  yes this simplicity would allow your transformations to apply to the :port number.  you could simplify further by including the scheme_colon_slashes in the part transformed.  as your values are coming from user written config files, do you need to care about invalid characters in those transforming into invalid in the scheme or port number - characters in the resulting url anyways?  after that, do you even need urlsplit at all in your `_apply_hostname_transformations_to_url()` function? ``` | | | |

| ``` FWIW, if we were to add a parameter, I'd lean towards a name of "invalid_url_characters = None" defaulting to using what's in our private _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE global when None but otherwise letting the user specify a sequence of characters. ``` | | | |

I have been holding off on 3.7.x and 3.6.x security releases pending resolutions of this and other open security issues. But based on the most recent discussions, my take is that it would be a disservice to anyone still using 3.7 or 3.6 to release with the most recent "partial" fix ([GH-25924](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25924 "GitHub PR 25924: [merged] [3.6] bpo-43882 - urllib.parse should sanitize urls containing ASCII newline and tabs") / [GH-25924](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25924 "GitHub PR 25924: [merged] [3.6] bpo-43882 - urllib.parse should sanitize urls containing ASCII newline and tabs")) if it going to cause breakage.

| ``` Hello All,  I think, the current striping of ASCII newline and tab is a _reasonable_ solution given it was a security issue.   It also follows the guidelines of "WHATWG" (Specifically Point 3)  > 2. If input contains any ASCII tab or newline, validation error. > 3. Remove all ASCII tab or newline from input.  And as per WHATWG, "A validation error does not mean that the parser terminates.  Termination of a parser is always stated explicitly, e.g., through a return statement."  I agree that terms used in spec vs representing it with library code may not be 1:1, but we tried to stay close and followed the existing behavior of widely used clients.  This is a fix, per a security report, and per an evolv{ed,ing} standard recommendation. When dealing with security fixes, there could be simple or more complex migration involvements.   My reading of the previous message was, even if we raised exception or gave as a parameter, it wont be any better for certain downstream users, as we let the security problem open, and have it only as opt-in fix.   With respect to control   The comment in the review - <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25595#pullrequestreview-647122723> was to make these characters available in module level parameters, so that if users prefer to override, they could patch it.  so a revert may not be necessary for the reason of lack of control.  In short, at this moment, I still feel that is reasonable fix at this moment for the problem report, and intention to move closer to whatwg spec. ``` | | | |

| ``` There is no less intrusive fix as far as I can see.  I believe we're down to either stick with what we've done, or do nothing.  It doesn't have to be the same choice in all release branches, being more conservative with changes the older the stable branch is okay.  (ie: removing this from 3.6 and 3.7 seems fine even if more recent ones do otherwise)  Based on my testing, raising an exception is more intrusive to existing tests (which we can only ever hope is representative of code) than stripping.  At least as exposed by running the changes through many tens of thousands of unittest suites at work.  ie: if we raise an exception, pandas.read_json() starts failing because that winds up using urlsplit in hopes of extracting the scheme and comparing that to known values as their method of deciding if something should be treated as a URL to data rather than data.  Pandas would need to be fixed.  That urlsplit() API use pattern is repeated in various other pieces of code: urlsplit is not expected to raise an exception.  The caller then has a conditional or two testing some parts of the urlsplit result to make a guess as to if something should be considered a URL or not.  Doing code inspection, pandas included, this code pretty much always then goes on to pass the original url value off to some other library, be it urllib, or requests, or ...).  Consequences of that code inspection finding?  With our existing character stripping change, new data is then allowed to pass through these urlsplit uses and be considered a URL.  Which leads to some code sending the url with embedded \r\n\t chars on to other APIs - a concern expressed a couple of times above.  Even though urlsplit isn't itself a validation API, it gets used as an early step in peoples custom identification and validation attempts.  So *any* change we make to it at all in any way breaks someones expectations, even if they probably shouldn't have had those expectations and aren't doing wise validation.  Treat this analysis as a sign that we should provide an explicit url validator because almost everyone is doing it some form of wrong. ([issue43883](issue43883 "[open] Making urlparse WHATWG conformant"))  I did wonder if Mike's suggestion of removing the characters during processing, but leaving them in the final result in <https://bugs.python.org/issue43882#msg393033> is feasible as remediation for this?  My gut feeling is that it isn't.  It doesn't solve the problem of preventing the bad data from going where it shouldn't.  Even if we happen to parse that example differently, the unwanted characters are still retained in other places they don't belong.  Fundamantelly: We require people to make a different series of API call and choices in the end user code to **explicitly not use unvalidated inputs**.  Our stdlib API surface can't satisfy that today and use of unvalidated data in wrong places is a broad software security antipattern theme. ``` | | | |

|  |  | The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL allows for some |
|  |  | forms of attacks. Following the WHATWG specification that updates :rfc:`3986`, |
|  |  | ASCII newline ``\n``, ``\r`` and tab ``\t`` characters are stripped from the |
|  |  | URL by the parser in :mod:`urllib.parse` preventing such attacks. The removal |
|  |  | characters are controlled by a new module level variable |
|  |  | ``urllib.parse.\_UNSAFE\_URL\_BYTES\_TO\_REMOVE``. (See :issue:`43882`) |
