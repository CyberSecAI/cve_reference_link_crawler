Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the user suggestion feature in Discourse, specifically when composing a message from a topic. The system was incorrectly including users who were participants in "whisper" posts within the topic, even though these users were not meant to be revealed to other participants.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the unintended disclosure of whisper participants through the user suggestion feature during message composition.
- **Incorrect Filtering:** The system failed to properly filter user suggestions, leading to the inclusion of users who were only part of whisper conversations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to identify users who have participated in "whisper" conversations within a topic, potentially revealing sensitive information about their participation or relationship to the content of the whisper messages. This could lead to unauthorized access of information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Message Composition:** An attacker initiates a message composition within a topic.
- **User Suggestion Trigger:** As the attacker types, the user suggestion feature is activated.
- **Information Leakage:**  The user suggestion feature incorrectly includes whisper participants in the list of suggested users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a participant in the topic where the whisper message was posted.
- The attacker must be able to compose a new message within that topic.
- No special permissions are necessary beyond being a general participant in a topic.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Discourse versions up to stable v2.7.12, beta v2.8.0.beta10, and tests-passed v2.8.0.beta10.
- The issue was resolved in stable versions 2.7.13 and above, beta versions 2.8.0.beta11 and above, and tests-passed versions 2.8.0.beta11 and above.
- The fix involves modifying the `user_search.rb` model to filter user suggestions to only include users who have participated in "regular" (non-whisper) posts in the topic.
- A test (`user_search_spec.rb`) was also added to verify that whisper users are no longer revealed in the user suggestions.
- The commit fixing the issue is [702685b](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/702685b6a06ae45a544fc702027f1e4573d94aaa).
