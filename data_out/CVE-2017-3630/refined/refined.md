Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-3630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient stack guard page size in the `rsh` (remote shell) utility on unpatched Oracle Solaris systems. This allows for a "stack clash".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Stack Guard Page:** The primary weakness is the small stack guard page, which is a memory region that prevents the stack from colliding with other memory regions like the heap.
*   **Stack Clash:** Due to the small guard page, an attacker can manipulate memory layout to cause the stack to grow beyond its intended boundaries and collide with the heap. This allows for controlled writing to the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges to root. This is achieved by writing to the stack to create a SUID (Set User ID) root shell.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the stack, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This vulnerability is exploitable through local access on the target system.
*   **RSH Utility:** The exploit targets the `rsh` utility, which must be setuid root.
*   **Environment Variables:** The exploit utilizes the `LC_ALL` and a padding environment variable to control memory layout and trigger the stack clash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the target Solaris system.
*   **Ability to execute commands:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands, including compiling C code using gcc.
*   **Writable Directory:** The attacker requires access to a writable directory to create files for the exploit.
*   **Target must be vulnerable:** The system must be unpatched.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves crafting specific environment variables `LC_ALL` and `P` to manipulate memory layout of the `rsh` process and cause the stack to clash with the heap.
*   The `LC_ALL` variable is used to inject shellcode, along with specific return-oriented programming (ROP) gadgets.
*   The `P` variable is used to add padding to memory layout.
*   The provided C code (Solaris\_rsh.c) demonstrates the detailed steps of how to trigger the stack clash.
*   The metasploit module automates the process of compilation and execution of the exploit code.
*   The exploit works by creating a SUID root shell which then executes the attacker's payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions specific affected versions of Solaris (10 and 11) and provides steps to fix it.
*   The vulnerability is also referred to as "Stack Clash" in the exploit code and related documentation.
*   Multiple CVEs were released around this time with similar vulnerability, all related to stack clash.
