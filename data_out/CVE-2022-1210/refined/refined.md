Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-1210:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a resource consumption issue within the `tiff2ps` component of LibTIFF version 4.3.0. Specifically, an incorrect memory size request leads to excessive memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-400:** Resource exhaustion due to improper control of resource allocation. The program does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, enabling an attacker to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to the exhaustion of system resources, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive, thus denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating a specially crafted TIFF image file and using the `tiff2ps` utility to convert it to PostScript format.
- The attack requires user interaction, specifically opening a malicious TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted TIFF file to the targeted system/user.
- The attacker must induce a user to process the crafted TIFF file with the vulnerable `tiff2ps` utility.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Component:** `tiff2ps` utility in LibTIFF.
- **Affected Version:** LibTIFF version 4.3.0.
- **Public Exploit:** A proof-of-concept exploit is available, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- **NetApp Products:** Several NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability, specifically the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility.
- **Gentoo Linux:** Gentoo also lists this CVE as one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting `media-libs/tiff` prior to version 4.4.0.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service by providing a crafted TIFF file that when processed by `tiff2ps` leads to an out-of-memory condition.
