| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in [LibTIFF 4.3.0](?product.libtiff) ([Image Processing Software](?type.image_processing_software)). Affected by this vulnerability is some unknown processing of the component *tiff2ps*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a resource consumption vulnerability. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is [CWE-400](?vulnerability_cwe.196363 "Cwe"). The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources. As an impact it is known to affect availability.

The weakness was presented 04/03/2022 by mqrsv as *Issue 402*. It is possible to read the advisory at [gitlab.com](?advisory_url.196363). This vulnerability is known as [CVE-2022-1210](?source_cve.196363 "Cve"). It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details are unknown but a public exploit is available. The attack technique deployed by this issue is [T1499](?vulnerability_attck.196363 "Attck") according to MITRE ATT&CK.

A public exploit has been developed by mqrsv in TIFF File. It is possible to download the exploit at [gitlab.com](?exploit_url.196363). It is declared as proof-of-concept.

There is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.

See [VDB-237698](?id.237698), [VDB-237721](?id.237721), [VDB-238184](?id.238184) and [VDB-238185](?id.238185) for similar entries.
