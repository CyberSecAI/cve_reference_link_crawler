{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the head token minting policy within the Hydra protocol. Specifically, the initial validator does not properly validate the head ID in the datum of the outputs. This allows a malicious head initialiser to replace the real head ID with a policy they control.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect data validation logic in the head token minting policy.",
      "Missing check in the off-chain code for verifying the head ID in the datum of outputs at the initial validator.",
       "Insufficient validation of the head ID during the burning of the head state token in the `viaAbort` redeemer."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious head initialiser can extract participation tokens (PTs) from the control of the Hydra validators. This can lead to: \n\n- **Locked Participant Funds:**  Other participants are unable to reclaim funds they have committed because the malicious initialiser controls a PT required to burn all PTs during an abort transaction.\n- **Spoofed Commits:** The attacker can use the extracted PTs to falsely claim that they have committed a UTxO, forcing other participants to pay the attacker's "committed" amount during fanout, even though the funds were never actually contributed to the head.\n- **Other potential abuses:** The attacker gains control over a PT which breaks the security assumption in the Hydra protocol. This can allow for further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious head initialisation transaction. The attacker crafts a transaction where they specify a policy they control instead of the actual head ID in the datum of an output at the initial validator.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a head initialiser. They must have the ability to create a minting policy, mint tokens under that policy, and craft transactions to exploit the vulnerability. They also must be one of the participants to be able to initialise the head."
