- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of CA certificate data during import. Specifically, malicious code embedded within the certificate is not sanitized and is later displayed on the FortiWeb's web UI Certificate View page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS), tag injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands within the context of a user's browser session by injecting malicious scripts through a compromised certificate.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the import of a maliciously crafted CA certificate, which when viewed through the web UI triggers the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to import a malicious CA certificate to the FortiWeb device.
