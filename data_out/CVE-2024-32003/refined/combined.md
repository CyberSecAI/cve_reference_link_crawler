# Dusk Plugin

Integrates Laravel Dusk browser testing into Winter CMS, providing Winter CMS and plugin developers with the tools to
run automated tests on a fully functional Winter CMS instance through a virtual browser.

> **Note:** This plugin is intended to be used for development purposes only. Configured improperly, it can allow users
> to circumvent authentication and sign in as any user. This plugin should be specified as a **development dependency** (ie. `require-dev`) only.

## Getting started

To install the plugin, you may install it through the [Winter CMS Marketplace](https://wintercms.com/plugin/winter-dusk), or you may install it using Composer:

```
composer require --dev winter/wn-dusk-plugin
```

Then, run the migrations to ensure the plugin is enabled:

```
php artisan winter:up
```

To run the browser tests, you must install the Chrome web-driver and have the Google Chrome browser installed on the machine running the tests. The web-driver can be installed by running the following command:

```
php artisan dusk:chrome-driver
```

## Running the tests

By default, the browser tests are configured to run the tests against a website served by the in-built Laravel web server. You may start this server by running the following:

```
php artisan serve
```

To start the browser tests, run:

```
php artisan dusk
```

This will execute all available browser tests in all enabled plugins on your Winter CMS installation. If you would like to run the tests for one plugin only, you may add the plugin code as an argument:

```
php artisan dusk Acme.Blog
```

As a shortcut after running the tests, you may re-run the failed tests by executing the following command:

```
php artisan dusk:fails
```

---

## Creating browser tests for your plugin

The Dusk plugin makes it a breeze to create browser tests for your own plugin.

Browser test classes should reside in the **tests/browser** folder of your plugin. Each test class file should ended with `Test.php` to indicate it is a class of test cases, and should extend the `Winter\Dusk\Classes\BrowserTestCase` class.

For example, a blog plugin may wish to create a **BlogTest.php** file with the following content:

```
<?php namespace Acme\Blog\Tests\Browser;

use Winter\Dusk\Classes\BrowserTestCase;

class BlogTest extends BrowserTestCase
{
    public function testPost()
    {
        // the test to run
    }
}
```

Each test method in the class should be prefixed with **test** to denote that it is a test case.

To run the browser tests for your plugin, simply run the following:

```
php artisan dusk Acme.Blog
```

# Dusk plugin may allow unfettered user authentication in misconfigured installs

High

[bennothommo](/bennothommo)
published
GHSA-chcp-g9j5-3xxx
Apr 12, 2024

## Package

composer

winter/wn-dusk-plugin
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 2.1.0

## Patched versions

2.1.0

## Description

The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]` is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User plugin).

If a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication.

As indicated in the [README](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-dusk-plugin/blob/main/README.md), this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development dependency only in Composer.

In order to remediate this issue, the special routes used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer manually specifies it in their configuration.

The automatic configuration performed by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration.

### Impact

Low. This will only affect users in which the Winter CMS installation meets ALL the following criteria:

* The Dusk plugin is installed in the Winter CMS instance.
* The application is in production mode (ie. the `debug` config value is set to `true` in `config/app.php`).
* The Dusk plugin's automatic configuration has been overridden, either by providing a custom `.env.dusk` file or by providing custom configuration in the `config/dusk` folder, or by providing configuration environment variables externally.
* The environment has been configured to use production data in the database for testing, and not the temporary SQLite database that Dusk uses by default.
* The application is connectable via the web.

### Patches

Issue has been fixed in v2.1.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
