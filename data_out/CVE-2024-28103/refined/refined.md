Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `Permissions-Policy` header, which is configurable in the application, was only being served on responses that had an HTML related `Content-Type`. This meant that non-HTML content types, such as `application/json` or `image/svg+xml`, were not receiving the policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Security Header:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `Permissions-Policy` header on non-HTML responses, which could result in inconsistent or weakened security enforcement for those content types.
- **Inconsistent Policy Application:** The application's security policy was not being consistently applied across all relevant content types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is that the configured Permissions-Policy is not enforced for non-HTML content types which could lead to unexpected behavior or a compromise of security for non-HTML content.
- The NetApp advisory indicates that successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service. This suggests that depending on the application's use of non-HTML content and the policy it's trying to enforce, the lack of a `Permissions-Policy` header could have severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- This vulnerability is not directly exploited via a network request but rather by a lack of security policy enforcement when serving non-HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker doesn't need any special capabilities or position to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs when the server fails to send the `Permissions-Policy` header for non-HTML responses.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Rails versions 6.1.0 and above.
*   Patches are available for the 6.1, 7.0, and 7.1 series of Rails.
*   The fix includes modifying the `PermissionsPolicy` middleware to apply the `Permissions-Policy` header regardless of content type.
