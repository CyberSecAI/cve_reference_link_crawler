## Affected versions

>= 6.1.0

## Patched versions

6.1.7.8, 7.0.8.4, 7.1.3.4, 7.2.0.beta2

## Description

# Permissions-Policy is Only Served on HTML Content-Type

The application configurable Permissions-Policy is only served on responses

with an HTML related Content-Type.

This has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-28103](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fwhr-88qx-h9g7 "CVE-2024-28103").

Versions Affected: >= 6.1.0

Not affected: < 6.1.0

Fixed Versions: 6.1.7.8, 7.0.8.4, and 7.1.3.4

## Impact

[[CVE-2024-28103](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fwhr-88qx-h9g7 "CVE-2024-28103")]

The application configurable Permissions-Policy is only
served on responses with an HTML related Content-Type.

This change allows all Content-Types to serve the
configured Permissions-Policy as there are many non-HTML
Content-Types that would benefit from this header.
(examples include image/svg+xml and application/xml)
