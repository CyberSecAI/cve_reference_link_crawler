[[CVE-2024-28103](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fwhr-88qx-h9g7 "CVE-2024-28103")]

The application configurable Permissions-Policy is only
served on responses with an HTML related Content-Type.

This change allows all Content-Types to serve the
configured Permissions-Policy as there are many non-HTML
Content-Types that would benefit from this header.
(examples include image/svg+xml and application/xml)
