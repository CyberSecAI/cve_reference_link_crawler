# remote-triggered panic due to unexpected frame serialization order when completing the handshake

Moderate

[marten-seemann](/marten-seemann)
published
GHSA-3q6m-v84f-6p9h
Oct 27, 2023

## Package

gomod

quic-go
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v0.37.0, v0.37.1, v0.37.2

## Patched versions

v0.37.3

## Description

**Summary**

By serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space.

**Impact**

An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets.

**Patches**

[v0.37.3](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3) contains a patch. Versions before v0.37.0 are not affected.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-46239

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
