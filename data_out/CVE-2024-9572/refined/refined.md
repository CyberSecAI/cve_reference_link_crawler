- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper input validation in the `groupe_id` parameter via `/soplanning/www/process/groupe_save.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote user can send a specially crafted query to an authenticated user and steal their session details.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted query to an authenticated user via the vulnerable `groupe_id` parameter in `/soplanning/www/process/groupe_save.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious request to an authenticated user, likely by crafting a link and tricking a user into clicking it.
