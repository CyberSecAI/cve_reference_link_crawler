- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data. An attacker can modify a variable with a malicious payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker, with the necessary user permissions, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected part of the application. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker manipulates a variable in the application with a malicious XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with the application.
    - The attacker needs to have user permissions sufficient to modify a variable.
