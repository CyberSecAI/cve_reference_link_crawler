Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47090.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs in the `memory-failure.c` file of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when retrying `get_any_page()` during a soft offline operation using `madvise(MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE)`, the `MF_COUNT_INCREASED` flag is not cleared. This flag indicates that the page reference count has been incremented. However, during a retry, the reference count might not actually be incremented, leading to a mismatch and a kernel BUG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is an incorrect flag management when retrying the `get_any_page()` function in the context of memory soft offlining. The `MF_COUNT_INCREASED` flag persists across retries, even if the page's reference count wasn't actually increased. This leads to a situation where the code operates under a false assumption about the page's reference count.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a kernel panic. The incorrect reference count leads to a `VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)` assertion failure, which halts the system. This denial-of-service vulnerability can be triggered by a user-space process using `madvise()` with the `MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE` option.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `madvise()` system call with the `MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE` flag. A process can trigger the vulnerability by calling `madvise()` on a memory region with `MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to execute code and call system calls on the vulnerable system. This usually implies a user-space process with normal permissions.

**Additional details:**
The provided content consists of three different patches that fix the same bug, targeting slightly different code locations/kernel versions. The core fix involves clearing the `MF_COUNT_INCREASED` flag before retrying the `get_any_page()` operation. All three patches apply the same logic `flags &= ~MF_COUNT_INCREASED;` but at slightly different lines: 1939, 2202, and 2235.
The vulnerability was reported by Hulk Robot while testing `madvise()` with `MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE`, and the fix was introduced by Liu Shixin. The call trace included in the patch description indicates that the issue occurs within the `release_pages` function.
