Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35988:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content consistently refers to a fix for `TASK_SIZE` on 64-bit RISC-V systems with NOMMU. This is directly related to the vulnerability described in the commit messages, confirming its relevance. The core issue is an incorrect definition of `TASK_SIZE` when RAM exists above 4GB.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

   - The root cause is an incorrect definition of `TASK_SIZE` in the RISC-V architecture's memory management code when running in NOMMU (No Memory Management Unit) mode, specifically for 64-bit systems.
   - In NOMMU mode, userspace memory can be allocated anywhere in physical RAM. The original `TASK_SIZE` definition assumed a maximum addressable space of 4GB (`0xffffffffUL`).
   -  This assumption was invalid if more than 4GB of RAM was present, leading to issues in the userspace memory access routines.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**

   - **Incorrect `TASK_SIZE` Definition:** The `TASK_SIZE` was hardcoded to 4GB, while it should represent the actual available address space when more than 4GB of RAM is available in NOMMU mode.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

   - **Spurious Failures in Userspace Access Routines:** The incorrect `TASK_SIZE` definition caused failures in userspace memory access routines. This can manifest as:
      -  Unexpected program crashes or errors
      -  Incorrect memory accesses.
   - While not explicitly stated as a privilege escalation, it can lead to unpredictable behavior in user-space applications, which can be a base for further exploitation in some cases.

**5. Attack Vectors**

   -  The vulnerability can be triggered by any application running on a RISC-V 64-bit system in NOMMU mode that uses memory beyond 4GB.
   -  It is not an attack that is actively initiated by an outside actor but is a misconfiguration in the kernel that will lead to issues.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

   -   The attacker would need to have the ability to execute code on a RISC-V 64-bit system running in NOMMU mode with more than 4GB of RAM. This position is necessary for triggering the bug due to the incorrect `TASK_SIZE`.

**Technical Details**

- The fix changes the definition of `TASK_SIZE` from `0xffffffffUL` to `_AC(-1, UL)`. This sets `TASK_SIZE` to the maximum possible value for an unsigned long (`-1UL`), which is `2^64 -1` on a 64-bit system. This ensures that the userspace has access to the full range of available physical memory.

**Summary of Changes**
The fix is a one-line change in `arch/riscv/include/asm/pgtable.h`, specifically modifying the definition of `TASK_SIZE`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commits all reference the same upstream commit `6065e736f82c817c9a597a31ee67f0ce4628e948`, highlighting that this fix is being backported across different kernel versions.
- The Debian LTS announcement for `linux-5.10` also lists CVE-2024-35988, thus further confirming its relevance.
