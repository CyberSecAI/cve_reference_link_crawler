Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application improperly sanitizes or encodes user-supplied input before storing it in a persistent data store. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the browsers of other users when they access the stored content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based (AV:N).
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious script.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning another user needs to view the injected malicious content in their browser for the attack to execute.

**CVSS Vector:**
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-26047 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager. An attacker with low privileges can inject malicious scripts into the application. When another user views the affected content, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within their session.
