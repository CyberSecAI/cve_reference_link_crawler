| There is no discussion for a long time, mean community don't think this is a problem.  In fact, the token is same as you user and password, if you want to get higher security request, you can implement your own auth plugin after 2.1.0 version. |

| In fact, I don't think this problem is a vulnerability. Users can set their own `token.secret.key` when they deploy clusters.  But the CVE has include this issue, we just comment the solution:   1. upgrade 2.1.0 and develop auth private plugin for your env and company to enhance security completely. (**recommand**) 2. set private `token.secret.key` when you deploy clusters. |
