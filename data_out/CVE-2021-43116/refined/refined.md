{
  "CVE-2021-43116": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Nacos where the default JWT secret key is used. By intercepting and modifying the login response, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a default, hardcoded JWT secret key in Nacos's authentication mechanism. This default key allows an attacker to forge valid authentication tokens.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded default JWT secret key",
      "Lack of proper authentication validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass login and gain unauthorized access to the Nacos backend. This could lead to complete control over the application, including data access and modification.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves intercepting the login request/response using a tool like Burp Suite. The attacker modifies the server's response to include a valid JWT signed with the default key and then sends the manipulated response back to the client, thereby bypassing authentication.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to intercept network traffic",
        "Knowledge of the default JWT secret key"
    ]
  }
