- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Elementor Website Builder Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could enable a malicious actor to inject arbitrary JavaScript, leading to actions like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads executed on the website when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts are injected into the website, likely through a vulnerable input field or parameter, and executed when a user interacts with the affected element.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts, which might be possible through a vulnerable form or by modifying data handled by the plugin. The attacker needs a contributor level privilege.
