In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu/vkms: fix a possible null pointer dereference

In amdgpu_vkms_conn_get_modes(), the return value of drm_cvt_mode()
is assigned to mode, which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference
on failure of drm_cvt_mode(). Add a check to avoid null pointer
dereference.
