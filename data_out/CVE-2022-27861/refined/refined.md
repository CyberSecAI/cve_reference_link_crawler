Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Ninja Popups plugin for WordPress fails to properly validate redirect URLs, leading to an open redirection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of validation for redirect URLs. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary URLs that will be used for redirection.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of exploitation. Attackers can trick users into visiting a legitimate site, only to be redirected to a malicious site.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a URL that includes a malicious redirect target.
