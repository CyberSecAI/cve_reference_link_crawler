## CVE-2024-5471

### Unrestricted takeover of Node Agent servers fixed in build 4002

**Severity:** High

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5471

**Affected Software Version(s):** DDI Central Node Agent builds below 4002

**Fixed Version:** Build 4002

**Fixed on:** May 6, 2024

**Details:**

The ManageEngine DDI Node Agent build number 4001 had a high severity vulnerability where the sensitive keys were hard-coded, making it easy to take over agent node servers. The vulnerability was fixed by dynamically generating the dynamic keys during each installation, and using a unique ID that varies for each agent server, enhancing security.

**Impact:**

This flaw allowed attackers to easily gain unauthorized control over agent nodes, compromising the entire system's security.
