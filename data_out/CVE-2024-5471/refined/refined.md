- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded sensitive keys in ManageEngine DDI Node Agent build 4001.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded sensitive keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unrestricted takeover of Node Agent servers, leading to compromise of the entire system's security.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but implied to be remote due to the nature of the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to exploit the hardcoded keys to take control of agent nodes, likely from a network position.
