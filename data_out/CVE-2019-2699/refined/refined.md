Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2699:

**1. Verification:**

The Gentoo security advisory and the Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory both list CVE-2019-2699 as a vulnerability affecting Oracle Java SE. The Oracle document provides more specific details, indicating the vulnerability is related to a Windows DLL within Java SE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability lies within the Java SE's Windows DLL. The specific nature of the DLL and the flaw are not described, but the document does indicate that it is related to how Java handles DLLs.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  The weakness is present in how a Windows DLL is handled by Java SE. This could indicate improper memory management, insecure handling of function calls, or other code execution related issues.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for a high impact in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. This indicates a potential for complete system compromise, data theft, modification, and complete disruption of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is described as "Multiple", indicating it could be triggered through various methods such as network access and potentially by loading malicious DLLs in some way through Java execution. The document indicates that untrusted code loaded through methods like Java Web Start applications or Java applets (in Java SE 8) is a potential entry point.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication which significantly lowers the bar for an attacker. It is also indicated that the attacker has to be able to get the targeted user to load and run untrusted code (eg. malicious Java Web Start applications or Java applets).
