Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-4936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a DLL sideloading issue in the Synaptics DisplayLink installer. The installer improperly searches for DLLs, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs from a local directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Sideloading:** The primary vulnerability is that the installer looks for DLL files in a user-controlled path before searching system paths. Specifically, if a folder with a `.local` suffix exists next to the installer executable, the installer will load DLLs from there.
- **Lack of Integrity Checks:** There is a lack of proper integrity checks to verify the authenticity or legitimacy of the DLLs being loaded.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The installer runs with elevated privileges, so a malicious DLL loaded through this vulnerability will also execute with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By successfully sideloading a malicious DLL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system with the same elevated privileges as the installer.
- **System Compromise:** This could lead to a complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal sensitive information, or take control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system to create the malicious folder and place the malicious DLL.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the local file system by creating the specific folder structure with a `.local` suffix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
- **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create folders and copy files within the same directory as the installer executable.
- **Social Engineering (potentially):** While not strictly required, social engineering may be used to trick users into running a malicious installer.

**Technical Details:**
- An attacker creates a folder with the same name as the installer executable but with a `.local` suffix (e.g., `setup.exe.local`).
- The attacker then creates subfolders within the `.local` folder that mimic folders present in `C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls*`.
- A malicious DLL file named `comctl32.dll` is copied into each of these created subfolders.
- When the installer (`setup.exe`) runs, it will load the malicious `comctl32.dll` instead of the legitimate one from the system directories.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- The EXE variants of DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Windows version 11.1 M1 and earlier are vulnerable.
- MSI and INF packages, as well as drivers loaded through Windows Update, are not affected.

**Fixed Version:**
- DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Windows version 11.2 M0 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the installer executable (`.exe` files) and not to the drivers themselves once they are installed.
- This vulnerability could be used to gain an initial foothold for further exploitation.
