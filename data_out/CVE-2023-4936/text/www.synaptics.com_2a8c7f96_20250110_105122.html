Synaptics Security Advisory

Synaptics-DisplayLink-privilege escalation vulnerability via a dynamic library
sideloading -Internal Ref: PPDSYS-357

CVE: CVE-2023-4936

CVSS: 5.5  AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

CAPEC -  CAPEC-184: Software Integrity Attack                (Version 3.9)

Affected Drivers

File Description: Synaptics DisplayLink Installer

File Versions: Only the EXE variants of DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Windows
DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Windows version 11.1 M1 and earlier,

â€¢  MSI and INF packages are not affected. This does -not- affect drivers loaded

with Microsoft Windows Update (WU)

Impact

It is possible to sideload a compromised DLL during the installation at elevated
privilege.

Background

The Synaptics /DisplayLink installer uses a standard installer executable setup.exe

Technical Details

An attacker creates folder with the same name as an executable but with .local suffix.
Then create folders in that ".local" folder with the same name as folders in
C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls* . Then copy a
malicious  DLL  into all of created folders as comctl32.dll.

 If {executable_name}.local folder/file is present next to executable, then DLL
redirection mechanism kicks in and OS will look into *.local folder when loading
certain DLLs."
