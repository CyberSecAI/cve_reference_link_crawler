- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in IBM Rational ClearQuest.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed within the context of a user's browser session, leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into fields within the application's data store. When other users access the affected data, the stored scripts are executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to write data into the application which is then displayed to other users, such as through a vulnerable input field.
