The content is related to CVE-2022-31580.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of `flask.send_file` with attacker-controlled input, or unsafe use of `os.path.join` which allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability due to insecure handling of user-supplied file paths.
- Usage of `flask.send_file` with untrusted input.
- Unsafe use of `os.path.join` when concatenating paths, particularly when dealing with absolute paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can access arbitrary files and directories on the server's file system, including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files.
- Potential exposure of sensitive data like passwords and login credentials.
- Possible partial denial of service due to resource exhaustion by requesting large files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating file paths with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences.
- Providing absolute file paths as input.
- Sending crafted requests to download specific files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- No special privileges are required for exploitation.
