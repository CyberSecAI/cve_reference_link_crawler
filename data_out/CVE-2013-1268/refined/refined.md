Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-1268:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically win32k.sys) improperly handling objects in memory. This improper handling leads to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)
- Improper handling of objects in memory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege: An attacker could gain elevated privileges, potentially allowing them to execute code with system-level access.
- Kernel memory access: An attacker could read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
- Specially crafted application: The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the race condition and elevate privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Valid logon credentials to the target system
- Ability to log on locally to the target system
- Ability to execute a malicious, specially crafted application

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-1248 through CVE-2013-1277) affecting the Win32k component, all related to race conditions and improper memory handling.
*   The provided document mentions that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and was reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
*   Microsoft states they had not received any reports of active exploitation at the time of the bulletin's release.
* The document also notes that for Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT, this update has no severity rating due to attack vectors being blocked, but Microsoft still recommends applying the update as a defense-in-depth measure.
