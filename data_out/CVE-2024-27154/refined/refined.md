  "CVE-2024-27154": {
    "Root cause": "Passwords stored in clear-text in log files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Clear-text passwords written in logs when an user logs into the printer.",
      "Clear-text passwords written in logs when a password is modified.",
      "Insecure permissions on log files allow unauthorized read access."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can retrieve user passwords in clear text.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the printer's file system.",
      "Remote access via exploitation of other vulnerabilities that allow reading of the file system."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to access the log files, either locally or through a remote vulnerability. No authentication is required to access the log files themselves, but some vulnerabilities may require authentication or exploitation of other vulnerabilities to gain remote access."
  }
