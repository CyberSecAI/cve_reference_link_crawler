  "CVE-2016-8747": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2016-8747",
      "Description": "The refactoring to make wider use of ByteBuffer introduced a regression that could cause information to leak between requests on the same connection. When running behind a reverse proxy, this could result in information leakage between users. All HTTP connector variants are affected but HTTP/2 and AJP are not affected."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "A refactoring to make wider use of ByteBuffer introduced a regression.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Information leakage between requests on the same connection."
      ],
      "Impact": "Information leakage between users when running behind a reverse proxy.",
       "Attack vectors": "HTTP connections.",
      "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to establish an HTTP connection to a vulnerable server behind a reverse proxy."
    },
    "Affected Products": [
      "NetApp OnCommand Insight",
      "NetApp OnCommand Shift",
       "Apache Tomcat versions 8.5.7 to 8.5.9 and 9.0.0.M11 to 9.0.0.M15",
