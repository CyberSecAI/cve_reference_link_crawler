    <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
       of Apache Tomcat<sup>&reg;</sup> 8.x. Each vulnerability is given a
       <a href="security-impact.html">security impact rating</a> by the Apache
       Tomcat security team &mdash; please note that this rating may vary from
       platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
       is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
       version with a question mark.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
       but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
       provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.</p>

    <p><strong>Please note that Tomcat 8.0.x has reached
       <a href="tomcat-80-eol.html">end of life</a> and is no longer supported.
       Vulnerabilities reported after June 2018 were not checked against the
       8.0.x branch and will not be fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or
       later to obtain security fixes.</strong></p>

    <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
       apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
       Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 8.5 those are
       <a href="/tomcat-8.5-doc/building.html"><code>building.html</code></a> and
       <a href="/tomcat-8.5-doc/BUILDING.txt"><code>BUILDING.txt</code></a>.
       Both files can be found in the <code>webapps/docs</code> subdirectory
       of a binary distributive. You may also want to review the
       <a href="/tomcat-8.5-doc/security-howto.html">Security Considerations</a>
       page in the documentation.</p>

    <p>If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
       following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
       here, please send your questions to the public
       <a href="lists.html">Tomcat Users mailing list</a>
    </p>

    <p>If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
       unexpected behaviour that has <a href="security-impact.html">security
       impact</a>, or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
       please report them privately to the
       <a href="security.html">Tomcat Security Team</a>. Thank you.

    <p>When processing an HTTP/2 request, if the request exceeded any of the
       configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream was not reset
       until after all of the headers had been processed.</p>

    <p>When recycling various internal objects, including the request and the

    <p>Tomcat's internal fork of a Commons FileUpload included an unreleased, in
       progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on
       Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but
       failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk
       creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the disk
       being full.</p>

    <p>The fix for bug <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66512">66512</a> introduced a regression that was fixed
       as bug <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66591">66591</a>. The regression meant that, if a response did not
       have any HTTP headers set, no AJP <code>SEND_HEADERS</code> message would
       be sent which in turn meant that at least one AJP based proxy
       (mod_proxy_ajp) would use the response headers from the previous request
       for the current request leading to an information leak.</p>

    <p>Apache Tomcat uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload

    <p>While investigating issue <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64830">64830</a> it was discovered that Apache

    <p><strong>Important: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution</strong>
       <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-1938</a></p>

    <p>When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
       trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
       connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
       connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be
       exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior to Tomcat 8.5.51, Tomcat
       shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all
       configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security
       guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required.</p>
    <p>Prior to this vulnerability report, the known risks of an attacker being
       able to access the AJP port directly were:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>bypassing security checks based on client IP address</li>
       <li>bypassing user authentication if Tomcat was configured to trust
           authentication data provided by the reverse proxy</li>
       </ul>
    <p>This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed the
       following:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application
           including under the WEB-INF and META-INF directories or any other
           location reachable via ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()</li>
       <li>processing any file in the web application as a JSP</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those
       files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control
       the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along
       with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution
       possible.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port
       is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a
       defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning
       arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31
       or later. Users should note that a number of changes were made to the
       default AJP Connector configuration in 8.5.51 to harden the default
       configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 8.5.51 or later
       will need to make small changes to their configurations as a result.</p>

    <p>The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL)
    parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This
    led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was

    considered unlikely.</p>

    <p>The HTTP/2 implementation accepted streams with excessive numbers of

       execute was updated. The update was not correct. As a result, some
       scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have
       been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet
       has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of
       the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected.</p>

    <p>The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,
       when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that
       occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error
       page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the

   <p>If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content
      of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP
      method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the
      original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for
      static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to
      permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.</p>

    <p>Notes for other user provided error pages:</p>

    <p>When recycling the <code>Request</code> object to use for a new request,
    the <code>requestedSessionSSL</code> field was not recycled. This meant that
    a session ID provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled
    <code>Request</code> object could be used when it should not have been. This
    gave the client the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could
    have been used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been
    hard to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
    to use the 'correct' <code>Request</code> object. It was also necessary for
    at least one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as
    the HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.</p>

    <p>This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a

    <p>Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
       <code>StandardManager</code> persists session over a restart. The
       <code>PersistentManager</code> is able to persist sessions to files, a
       database or a custom <code>Store</code>. The cluster implementation
       persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
       these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
       persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
       Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
       session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
       arbitrary code.</p>

    <p>When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
       that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
       trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
       processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
       to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
       permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
       web application in which case the presence of the web application was
       confirmed, even if a user did not have access.</p>

    <p>The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
       any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
       before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
       could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
       (<code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code> and
       <code>mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled</code>) were introduced. The initial
       default was <code>false</code> for both since this was more secure. 
       However, due to regressions such as
       <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765">Bug
       58765</a> the default for <code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code>
       was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
       more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
       determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.</p>

    <p>When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the user
    agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat swallows the
    remaining request body so that the next request on the connection may be
    processed. There was no limit to the size of request body that Tomcat would
    swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never
    close the connection and a processing thread would remain allocated to the
    connection.</p>

    <p>The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
       levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
       under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the

    <p>The root cause of this error was a bug in Apache Commons FileUpload.
       Tomcat 8 uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
       implement the requirement of the Servlet 3.0 and later specifications to

    <p>Apache Tomcat 8.5.x has no dependency on any version of log4j.</p>
    
    <p>Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on
       log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this
       instance.</p>
    
    <p>It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 8.5.x to use log4j 2.x for
       Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the
       addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's
       internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this
       vulnerability.</p>

    <p>The first few releases of 8.5.x (8.5.3 and earlier) provided optional
       support for switching Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 1.x. Anyone one
       using these very old (5+ years), unsupported versions of Tomcat that
       switched to using log4j 1.x may need to address this vulnerability as
       log4j 1.x may be affected in some (probably rarely used) configurations.
       Regardless, they'll need to address the Tomcat vulnerabilities that have
       been made public in those 5+ years </p>

    <p>In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest
       solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j
