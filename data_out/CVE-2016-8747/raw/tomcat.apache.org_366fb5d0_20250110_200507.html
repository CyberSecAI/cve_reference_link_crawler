    <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
       of Apache Tomcat<sup>&reg;</sup> 9.x. Each vulnerability is given a
       <a href="security-impact.html">security impact rating</a> by the Apache
       Tomcat security team &mdash; please note that this rating may vary from
       platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
       is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
       version with a question mark.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
       but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
       provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.</p>

    <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
       apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
       Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 9.0 those are
       <a href="/tomcat-9.0-doc/building.html"><code>building.html</code></a> and
       <a href="/tomcat-9.0-doc/BUILDING.txt"><code>BUILDING.txt</code></a>.
       Both files can be found in the <code>webapps/docs</code> subdirectory
       of a binary distribution. You may also want to review the

    <p>If the default servlet is write enabled (<code>readonly</code>
       initialisation parameter set to the non-default value of
       <code>false</code>) for a case insensitive file system, concurrent read
       and upload under load of the same file can bypass Tomcat's case
       sensitivity checks and cause an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP
       leading to remote code execution.</p>

    <p>If Tomcat was configured to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly
       JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component which may throw an exception during
       the authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP status to
       indicate failure, the authentication may not have failed, allowing the

       Authentication components that behave in this way.</p>

    <p>When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of
       excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active

    <p>Apache Tomcat did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request
       header in some circumstances leading to the possibility of request
       smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: Tomcat
       incorrectly ignored the transfer-encoding header if the client declared
       it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; Tomcat honoured the identify
       encoding; and Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked
       encoding was the final encoding.</p>

    <p>An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during

    <p><strong>Important: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution</strong>

    <p>When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
       trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
       connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
       connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be
       exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior to Tomcat 9.0.31, Tomcat
       shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all
       configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security
       guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required.</p>
    <p>Prior to this vulnerability report, the known risks of an attacker being
       able to access the AJP port directly were:</p>
    <ul>

       <li>bypassing user authentication if Tomcat was configured to trust
           authentication data provided by the reverse proxy</li>
       </ul>
    <p>This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed the
       following:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application
           including under the WEB-INF and META-INF directories or any other
           location reachable via ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()</li>
       <li>processing any file in the web application as a JSP</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those
       files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control
       the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along
       with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution
       possible.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port
       is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a
       defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning
       arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31
       or later. Users should note that a number of changes were made to the
       default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default
       configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31 or later
       will need to make small changes to their configurations as a result.</p>

    <p>The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL)
    parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This
    led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
    located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
    Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
    considered unlikely.</p>

    <p>The refactoring in 9.0.28 introduced a regression. The result of the

    <p>Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets were only applied
       once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in
       this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was
       possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some
       security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources
       to users who were not authorised to access them.</p>

    <p>The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the
       context root was not correctly handled when used as part of a security
       constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was,
       therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web
       application resources that should have been protected. Only security
       constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.</p>

    <p>The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,
       when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that
       occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error
       page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the
       original HTTP method.</p>

   <p>If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content
      of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP
      method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the
      original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for
      static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to
      permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.</p>

    <p>Notes for other user provided error pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.
          JSPs used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error
          dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.</li>
      <li>By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the
          HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that
          they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the
          actual method.</li>

    <p>The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced a
       regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing
       completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the

    <p>The handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close

    <p>When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to read
       system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. Tomcat's
       system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used
       by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
       system properties that should not be visible.</p>

    <p>Apache Tomcat uses a package renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
       implement the file upload requirements of the Servlet specification. A
       denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that
       occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the
       size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file. This
       caused the file upload process to take several orders of magnitude
       longer than if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long.</p>

    <p><code>ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext()</code> is a public method
       and was accessible to web applications even when running under a security

    <p><strong>Low: Directory disclosure</strong>

    <p>When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
       that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
       trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
       processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
       to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
       permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
       web application in which case the presence of the web application was
       confirmed, even if a user did not have access.</p>

    <p>The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
       any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
       before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
       could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
       (<code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code> and
       <code>mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled</code>) were introduced. The initial
       default was <code>false</code> for both since this was more secure. 
       However, due to regressions such as
       <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765">Bug
       58765</a> the default for <code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code>
       was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
       more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
       determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.</p>

    <p>When recycling the <code>Request</code> object to use for a new request,
    the <code>requestedSessionSSL</code> field was not recycled. This meant that
    a session ID provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled
    <code>Request</code> object could be used when it should not have been. This
    gave the client the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could
    have been used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been
    hard to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
    to use the 'correct' <code>Request</code> object. It was also necessary for
    at least one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as
    the HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.</p>

    <p>The index page of the Manager and Host Manager applications included a
       valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an

       attacker had access to the Manager or Host Manager applications
       (typically these applications are only accessible to internal users, not
       exposed to the Internet), this token could then be used by the attacker
       to construct a CSRF attack.</p>

    <p>This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
       security manager.</p>
       
    <p>Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
       <code>StandardManager</code> persists session over a restart. The
       <code>PersistentManager</code> is able to persist sessions to files, a
       database or a custom <code>Store</code>. The cluster implementation
       persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
       these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
       persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
       Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
       session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
       arbitrary code.</p>

    <p>It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for
       Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the
       addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's

       vulnerability.</p>
   
    <p>In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest
