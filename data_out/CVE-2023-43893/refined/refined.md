{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `wakeup_mac` parameter within the Wake-On-LAN (WoL) functionality. The router firmware does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to this parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious actions on the router.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulation of the `wakeup_mac` parameter during a Wake-On-LAN (WoL) request"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send Wake-On-LAN requests to the router, which is usually done on the local network, and be able to modify the `wakeup_mac` parameter."
