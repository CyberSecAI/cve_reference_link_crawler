Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe handling of symbolic links within the `untarFile` function of the dotmesh application during the unpacking of a tar archive. The function attempts to prevent symlinks from pointing outside the extraction directory, but this check can be bypassed with a carefully crafted tar archive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The `untarFile` function does not correctly handle relative symlinks. It allows a symlink to be created, pointing to a parent directory, and then another symlink to be created using the first symlink to escape the intended directory and point elsewhere.
- **Inadequate Path Sanitization:** The code attempts to sanitize the symlink target, but it is insufficient to prevent directory traversal via `..` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can craft a malicious tar archive that, when extracted, creates symbolic links to files outside of the intended destination directory. If the process extracting the archive has the necessary read permissions, the attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.
- **Arbitrary File Write:**  Similarly, the attacker can use crafted symlinks to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system, with the permissions of the process executing the untar operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted tar archive containing malicious symbolic links that exploit the flawed path validation logic in `untarFile`. This archive could be delivered to the vulnerable system via various means (e.g. user uploaded files, downloaded from the internet etc).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to control the content of the tar archive being extracted by the vulnerable `dotmesh` application.
- **Application Vulnerability:** The attacker relies on the `dotmesh` application's flawed handling of symlinks during tar archive extraction.
- **Process Permissions:** The attacker's ability to read or write arbitrary files is limited by the file system permissions of the process running the untar operation.

**Additional Details**

- The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates the vulnerability, creating symlinks that point outside the intended directory during the extraction process.
- The vulnerability lies within the `untarFile` function specifically the logic related to processing symbolic links.
- The vulnerability was present in the latest commit of dotmesh at the time of reporting (November 27, 2020).
- The `securejoin` library is used, but it does not prevent the exploit due to the logic flaw in symlink processing.
