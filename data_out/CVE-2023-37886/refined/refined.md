- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that should only be available to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies from case to case.
- **Attack vectors:** Not specified but it involves a function lacking proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least subscriber-level privileges.
