Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-3293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the "Outside In Filters" component of Oracle Outside In Technology.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is related to how Oracle Outside In Technology processes certain data, specifically through its filters, which are used to parse different file formats. This could be due to issues such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other memory corruption flaws when handling specifically crafted input data. The exact nature of the flaw is not specified.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the following:
  *   **Confidentiality:**  Exposure of sensitive information. This may depend on what is being processed through the affected component.
  *   **Integrity:** Unauthorized modification of data or system resources.
  *   **Availability:** Denial-of-service, possibly leading to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is via the HTTP protocol. An attacker would need to send malicious data through a network connection to the affected component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the system running the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, meaning an anonymous user can trigger the flaw.
*   **Ability to send crafted data:**  The attacker must be able to send maliciously crafted data that triggers the vulnerability in the filters.

**Affected Versions:**
* Oracle Outside In Technology versions 8.5.2 and 8.5.3

**Additional Notes:**

* The CVSS v3 score is 8.6 (High)
* The document specifies that "the protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code". The CVSS score assumes direct network data input to the Outside In Technology. If this data isn't network based, then the CVSS score can be lower.
