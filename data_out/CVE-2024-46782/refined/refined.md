  "cveId": "CVE-2024-46782",
  "related": true,
  "content": "The provided content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ILA (Identifier Locator Addressing) subsystem, specifically within the `ila_nf_input` function. The root cause lies in the incorrect order of operations during network namespace exit. The `ila_xlat_exit_net()` function would free the rhashtable used by ILA and *then* unregister the netfilter hooks using `nf_unregister_net_hooks()`. Because netfilter hooks can still be called after the rhashtable is freed, this leads to a use-after-free condition when a network packet is processed by the hook. \n\n**Root cause:** Incorrect order of operations during network namespace exit. The rhashtable was freed before unregistering the netfilter hooks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**\n*   Use-after-free vulnerability in `ila_nf_input`.\n*   Incorrect resource management during network namespace teardown.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   Kernel crash, which could lead to a denial of service.\n*   Potential for further exploitation due to memory corruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Network packets processed by the ILA netfilter hook after the rhashtable has been freed.\n*   Triggering network namespace exit through `unshare` syscall.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Ability to create and manipulate network namespaces.\n*   Ability to send network traffic that is processed by the ILA netfilter hook. \n\nThe fix introduces a new `ila_xlat_pre_exit_net()` function that unregisters the netfilter hooks before the rhashtable is freed, preventing the use-after-free.",
  "additional_details": {
    "fix": "The fix involves adding a pre_exit handler that unregisters the netfilter hooks prior to the freeing of the rhashtable."
