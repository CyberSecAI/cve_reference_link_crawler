  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the IP addresses field when creating or editing firewall rules, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious template code into the 'IP addresses' field when managing firewall rules through the application's web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated to access the firewall management feature of the application."
