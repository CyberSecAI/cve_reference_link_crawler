- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unprivileged user can perform actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact depends on the vulnerable function but could lead to significant unauthorized modifications or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through a function lacking proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks, which could be accessed via the web interface or API endpoints of the WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with "Subscriber" level privileges (or potentially any user) could exploit the vulnerability. The attacker would likely need to interact with the vulnerable plugin through a web interface or API, lacking detailed information about specific request parameters or URLs.
