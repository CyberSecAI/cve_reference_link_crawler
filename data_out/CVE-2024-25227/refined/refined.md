Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `tb_login` parameter of the admin login page of ABO.CMS version 5.8. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in the `tb_login` parameter. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the `tb_login` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass login authentication and gain administrative access to the CMS by injecting SQL code into the `tb_login` field.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access, modify, and potentially delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Database Server Control:** In some scenarios, attackers could gain control over the database server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With administrative access, attackers can achieve full control over the website and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests to the login page.
*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attack vector uses a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/login.aspx` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ABO.CMS instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests, specifically POST requests.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is confirmed in ABO.CMS 5.8 and was tested on a setup with IIS 7.5/8.5, MSSQL Server 2008 RP2 SP3 running ASPx and PHP.
*   The author verified multiple SQLi techniques such as boolean-based blind, error-based, stacked queries, time-based blind, and union queries.
*   The exploit example provided uses the payload: `27872164' or 2579=2579--` to bypass authentication.
*   The author provides an example of how to use `sqlmap` to automate exploitation.
*   The vendor, despite claims of security, was unresponsive to vulnerability reports.
