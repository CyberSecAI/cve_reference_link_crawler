# Release notes

## Bonita UI Builder

We are excited to announce the release of [Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder), our new and enhanced development environment for creating all kind of interfaces, pages and forms for your applications! It brings along a host of advanced features and improved usability, designed to help you create compelling, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

Key benefits:

* Rapidly create and deploy UIs to reduce time to market
* Connect UIs with Bonitasoft for end-to-end alignment
* Tailor UIs to specific needs with advanced options
* A drag-and-drop interface empowers all users, regardless of technical skill
* Built with React for dynamic, responsive design

Features include:

* Drag & drop tools, 45+ widgets, React interfaces
* Code completion, custom JavaScript, native debugging
* Full Bonita Runtime compatibility

You can continue to use Bonita UI Designer as usual, while also having the opportunity to explore and get familiar with the capabilities of Bonita UI Builder.

Eventually, Bonita UI Designer will be phased out as we progressively transition to Bonita UI Builder. Rest assured, we are committed to providing comprehensive support and resources throughout this process. Our goal is to make this transition as smooth as possible, minimizing any disruption to your workflow.

Hereâ€™s what you can expect during this transition period:

* Continued access: Bonita UI Designer will remain fully operational for an extended period, allowing ample time for adaptation
* Support and resources: We offer extensive documentation, tutorials, and support to help you make the most of [Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder)
* Facilitated transition: We are dedicated to facilitate the transition, with detailed guides on how to use Bonita UI Builder, as well as [professional services support](https://www.bonitasoft.com/professional-services/on-demand-services)

## New available values

### Application Links

You can now use application links. See [Applications with Bonita UI Builder](applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder) for more details. Community users can also integrate their own links for applications developed with other tools.
See [FAQ](applications/ui-builder/faq) for common problems and solutions (e.g. if you use a customized or an old layout).

[Engine APIs](api/engine-api-overview) that allowed applications manipulation still work with legacy applications and have been deprecated in favor of new APIs that manipulate both application links and legacy applications.

[REST APIs](api/rest-api-overview) (see *Application* section) now also return application links in addition of legacy applications.

## Support matrix changes

### PostgreSQL update

Support for PostgreSQL has been updated to version **16.4**. See [hardware and software requirements](runtime/hardware-and-software-requirements) for the full matrix support.

### Ubuntu update

Support for Ubuntu has been updated to version **22.04**. See [hardware and software requirements](runtime/hardware-and-software-requirements) for the full matrix support.

## Feature deprecations and removals

### Database support

Due to the cost of maintenance of multiple DBMS, we are removing support for the following databases in the Community edition:

* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle

These databases will still be supported in Enterprise editions.

### Deprecated APIs

#### License API

The Rest API `GET /API/platform/license` is now replaced by `GET /API/system/information`. This latter requires to be logged in as a user with the "Admin" profile. See [dedicated Rest API documentation](https://api-documentation.bonitasoft.com/latest/#tag/Information/operation/getSystemInformation) for more details.

The corresponding Java API `com.bonitasoft.engine.api.PlatformAPI#getInformation()` is also deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Note that this new API is now also available in the Community edition and provides information about the case counters limit and current consumption.

## Bug fixes

### Fixes in Bonita 2024.3-u1 (2024-12-10)

* RUNTIME-1870 - REST API: JSON in the HTTP GET response cannot be parsed /API/bpm/caseInfo/{id}
* RUNTIME-1885 - Doubtful queries on application\_\* tables each time we navigate to a page
* RUNTIME-1889 - Super Admin App page is refreshed for each page switch
* RUNTIME-1911 - Using tenantid column in index causing query performance degradation

#### Fixes in Bonita Studio (including Bonita UI Designer)

* STUDIO-4477 - Some reserved keyword (limit) are missing during validation on Business Data Attributes
* STUDIO-4516 - Errors at .bos file import and migration
* STUDIO-4540 - Cloning a community project into a Subscription studio should migrate the internal build for subscription
* STUDIO-4542 - Due to Maven archetype plugin update, rest api generation generates invalid test class
* STUDIO-4543 - Rest API Extension validation fails with NPE when project folder and artifactId does not match
* STUDIO-4547 - Git repository clone failed when migrating a project which has already been cloned in the workspace.

#### Fixes in Bonita Runtime (including Bonita Applications)

* RUNTIME-48 - SFlowNodeNotFoundException: Quartzâ€™s Trigger associated to a Boundary timer does not get deleted when the process instance terminates
* RUNTIME-1895 - [SAML & OIDC SSO]: Bonita redirects to IdP if redirected target URL request lands on different node than the one where the original request was received

* RUNTIME-1884 - `password` attribute silently removed from `org.bonitasoft.engine.identity.impl.UserImpl` class. Add removal information in the release note. Make the XStream deserialization less strict to avoid deserialization exception when a some fields are unknown.

* STUDIO-4526 - Cannot add or edit a database connector
* STUDIO-4530 - ResourceException at Studio 9.0.4 restart after a Switch Workspace to exisitng workspace from a 9.0.3
* STUDIO-4531 - Getting started tutorial not working out of the box in Subscription editions.
* STUDIO-4533 - Refreshing a project after a git switch branch now adds/removes submodules as expected.
* STUDIO-4535 - Renaming a project without bdm or extensions fails
* STUDIO-4536 - Hazecalst discovery is enabled by default for Studio embedded Runtime
