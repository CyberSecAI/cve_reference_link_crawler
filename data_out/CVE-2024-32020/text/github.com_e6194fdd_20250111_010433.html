This topic addresses two CVEs:

- CVE-2024-32020:

  Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
  object database when source and target repository reside on the same
  disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
  those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
  untrusted user.

- CVE-2024-32021:

  When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
  filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
  on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
  directory.
