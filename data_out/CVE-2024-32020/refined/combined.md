# Cloning local repository by untrusted user allows the untrusted user to modify objects in the cloned repository at will

## Package

git

## Affected versions

v2.45.0 v2.44.0 <=v2.43.3 <=v2.42.1 v2.41.0 <=v2.40.1 <=v2.39.3

## Patched versions

v2.45.1 v2.44.1 v2.43.4 v2.42.2 v2.41.1 v2.40.2 v2.39.4

## Description

### Summary

Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user.

### Details

Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a "proper" clone and saves both disk space and compute time.

When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future.

### PoC

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This topic addresses two CVEs:

- CVE-2024-32020:

  Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
  object database when source and target repository reside on the same
  disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
  those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
  untrusted user.

- CVE-2024-32021:

  When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
  filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
  on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
  directory.

builtin/clone: refuse local clones of unsafe repositories

```
When performing a local clone of a repository we end up either copying
or hardlinking the source repository into the target repository. This is
significantly more performant than if we were to use git-upload-pack(1)
and git-fetch-pack(1) to create the new repository and preserves both
disk space and compute time.

Unfortunately though, performing such a local clone of a repository that
is not owned by the current user is inherently unsafe:

  - It is possible that source files get swapped out underneath us while
    we are copying or hardlinking them. While we do perform some checks
    here to assert that we hardlinked the expected file, they cannot
    reliably thwart time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) style races. It
    is thus possible for an adversary to make us copy or hardlink
    unexpected files into the target directory.

    Ideally, we would address this by starting to use openat(3P),
    fstatat(3P) and friends. Due to platform compatibility with Windows
    we cannot easily do that though. Furthermore, the scope of these
    fixes would likely be quite broad and thus not fit for an embargoed
    security release.

  - Even if we handled TOCTOU-style races perfectly, hardlinking files
    owned by a different user into the target repository is not a good
    idea in general. It is possible for an adversary to rewrite those
    files to contain whatever data they want even after the clone has
    completed.

Address these issues by completely refusing local clones of a repository
that is not owned by the current user. This reuses our existing infra we
have in place via `ensure_valid_ownership()` and thus allows a user to
override the safety guard by adding the source repository path to the
"safe.directory" configuration.

This addresses CVE-2024-32020.

Subject: git: 5 vulnerabilities fixed

Team,

The Git project released new security bug-fix versions today, May 14th,
2024: v2.45.1, v2.44.1, v2.43.4, v2.42.2, v2.41.1, v2.40.2, and v2.39.4.

The addressed issues are:

 * CVE-2024-32002
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8h77-4q3w-gfgv>):

   Recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symbolic
   links are susceptible to case confusion that can be exploited to
   execute just-cloned code during the clone operation.

   This allows the attack where a recursive clone would first initialize a
   submodule, then replace its parent directory with a symbolic link into
   the `.git/` directory where the second stage of the recursive clone
   would then write e.g. hooks that would be immediately executed before
   the user has had a chance to inspect what is getting executed.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32004
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xfc6-vwr8-r389>):

   Repositories can be configured to execute arbitrary code during local
   clones. To address this, the ownership checks introduced in v2.30.3
   are now extended to cover cloning local repositories.

   The most obvious attack vector is to prepare a local partial clone that
   is intentionally missing objects, override in its config what
   `upload-pack` executable use, and then talk another user on the same
   machine to clone that. This will run that configured `upload-pack`
   executable under using person's permissions.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32020
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-5rfh-556j-fhgj>):

   Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
   object database when source and target repository reside on the same
   disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
   those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
   untrusted user.

   This vulnerability allows a bait-and-switch attack where individual
   objects are replaced in already-indexed pack file; Git will not verify
   that the object's contents match its recorded object ID in that case.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Patrick
   Steinhardt.

 * CVE-2024-32021
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7>):

   When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
   filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
   on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
   directory.

   This allows the same attack vector that CVE-2022-39253 tried to
   prevent, by exploiting a time-of-check-time-of-use race.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Patrick
   Steinhardt.

 * CVE-2024-32465
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vm9j-46j9-qvq4>):

   It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories, even those
   unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted
   sources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the
   clone.

   The attack vectors are the same as for the CVEs mentioned above that
   involve local clones, but social-engineering is required to manipulate
   a user into unpacking a `.zip` file and running Git commands on the
   unpacked files.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Jeff King.

Note: the defense-in-depth protection in these new Git versions causes a
regression when cloning repositories enabled with Git LFS. The clone will
fail with an error message. The remedy is to call `git lfs pull` in the
fresh clone.

Thanks,
Johannes
