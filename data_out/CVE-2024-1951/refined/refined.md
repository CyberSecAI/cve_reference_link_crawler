Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1951

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin deserializes untrusted input, specifically through the use of the `lcg()::adl_enc_unserialize` function, when processing shortcodes. This function decodes and unserializes data, which is then used within the shortcode logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core issue lies in the insecure deserialization of data. By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object and providing it as a shortcode parameter, an attacker can inject this object into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** While the vulnerable plugin itself does not contain a POP chain, the ability to inject PHP objects can be leveraged if a POP chain exists within another plugin or the active theme.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion/Data Retrieval/Code Execution:** Successful exploitation, using a POP chain, may result in the attacker being able to delete arbitrary files on the server, retrieve sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code, depending on the available POP chain in the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the plugin's shortcode feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This access is needed to create and publish content that uses the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Knowledge of PHP and Serialization:** The attacker needs to understand PHP serialization and object injection to craft a malicious payload.
- **POP Chain (Optional but required for full impact):** For complete exploitation leading to arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs to find a suitable POP chain within another plugin or the theme installed in the target environment.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is found in `lcg-shortcode.php` where the `shortcode_create` function uses  `lcg()::adl_enc_unserialize`  to process shortcode parameters.
- The `lcg-adl-metabox.php` file also contains the vulnerable function which serializes and encodes data when saving plugin options using `lcg()::adl_enc_serialize`.
- The fix in version 1.3.9 replaces `adl_enc_unserialize` and `adl_enc_serialize` with `json_decoded` and `json_encoded`, respectively, to mitigate the issue by using JSON instead of PHP serialization. Additionally, a migration function was implemented to convert the data to the new format.
