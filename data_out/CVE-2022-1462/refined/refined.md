{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `tty_flip_buffer_push` function within `drivers/tty/tty_buffers.c`. The function writes to the `buf->tail->commit` resource without proper locking, leading to a race condition where its value may become less than expected. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read in the `flush_to_ldisc` function when calculating the `count` variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of proper locking"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can exploit the race condition to trigger a crash due to a slab out-of-bounds read. It might also lead to information leakage from memory or privilege escalation through memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to a pseudo-terminal (pty)",
      "Concurrent execution of ioctls `TIOCSTI` and `TCXONC` on a pty file descriptor"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user privileges",
       "Access to a pseudo-terminal device"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises from a missing lock around the critical operation `smp_store_release(&buf->tail->commit, buf->tail->used)` in `tty_flip_buffer_push`. The patch suggests using a mutex lock to protect this operation, preventing the race condition."
