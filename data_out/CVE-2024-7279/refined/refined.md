Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the login functionality. Specifically, the `username` parameter in the `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint is vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where a malicious user can inject SQL code into the `username` parameter. This allows the attacker to manipulate the database query and potentially bypass authentication.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication mechanism. In the provided example, the attacker is able to log in as an administrator using the payload `admin' or '1'='1`. This would grant them access to the administrative panel, potentially leading to further exploitation such as data exfiltration, modification, or complete system compromise.

*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` with the manipulated `username` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. They do not require any special privileges or system access before exploiting the vulnerability. They only require network access to the web application.

The provided content gives a clear description of the vulnerability, its location, how it can be exploited and the potential impact. It includes a proof of concept showing the injection payload (`admin' or '1'='1`), a sample HTTP request with the vulnerable parameter and a successful response.
