  "CVE-2024-9487": {
    "Description": "An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document.",
    "Root cause": "Improper verification of cryptographic signatures during SAML SSO authentication with encrypted assertions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of cryptographic signatures"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Direct network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance.",
      "A signed SAML response or metadata document forged by an attacker."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Network access to the target instance.",
      "Ability to forge a signed SAML response or metadata document."
    ],
     "Additional Details": "This vulnerability is a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from CVE-2024-4985. Encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted."
