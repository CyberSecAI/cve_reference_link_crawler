- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Checkbox Survey versions prior to 7.0 implement their own View State functionality by accepting a `_VSTATE` argument and deserializing it using `LosFormatter`. This bypasses the ASP.NET ViewState Message Authentication Code (MAC) setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization of ASP.NET View State data due to lack of MAC validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially crafted request containing malicious serialized data in the `_VSTATE` parameter to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Checkbox Survey application. No authentication is required.
