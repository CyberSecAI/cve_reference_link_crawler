# Leak of suppressed wiki requests outside of `CreateWikiGlobalWiki`

Moderate

Mar 27, 2024

## Package

CreateWiki
(MediaWiki)

## Affected versions

<23415c17ffb4832667c06abcf1eadadefd4c8937

## Patched versions

=>23415c17ffb4832667c06abcf1eadadefd4c8937

## Description

### Impact

It is possible for users with (delete) or (suppressrevision) on any wiki in the farm to access suppressed wiki requests by going to the request's entry on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where they have these rights. The same vulnerability was present briefly on the REST API before being quickly corrected in commit `6bc0685`. To our knowledge, the vulnerable commits of the REST API are not running in production anywhere.

### Patches

<https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/F3093343>

Issue has also been fixed as of commit `3415c1`

### Workarounds

Disable Special:RequestWikiQueue outside of the wiki where you receive wiki requests. An example of this is available at [miraheze/mw-config@fb3e68b](https://github.com/miraheze/mw-config/commit/fb3e68bcef459e9cf2a415241b28042a6c9727e8)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
