Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a faulty permissions check in the `RequestWikiRequestViewer.php` file of the CreateWiki extension for MediaWiki. Specifically, the code incorrectly allowed users with `delete` or `suppressrevision` rights on *any* wiki within a farm to view suppressed wiki requests through `Special:RequestWikiQueue`, even if those requests were intended to be visible only to users with the `createwiki` right on the global wiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on suppressed wiki requests. The code checked for `delete` or `suppressrevision` rights on *any* wiki instead of requiring `createwiki` on the global wiki.
*   **Incorrect Permission Check Logic**: The code checked if the user has *any* of the required rights (`delete` or `suppressrevision`) on *any* wiki, rather than requiring the specific `createwiki` right on the global wiki where the requests were created. The code also performed an additional check for `read` permission, which should not have been included in this permission check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Users with `delete` or `suppressrevision` rights on any wiki in the farm could gain unauthorized access to the content of suppressed wiki requests.
*  **Confidentiality Breach**:  Suppressed wiki requests, which may contain sensitive information, could be viewed by unauthorized users, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Special:RequestWikiQueue:** The primary attack vector was through the `Special:RequestWikiQueue` page, accessible on any wiki where the CreateWiki extension was installed.
*   **REST API (briefly):** The same vulnerability was briefly present in the REST API, though it was quickly patched.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on any wiki in the farm.
*   **Sufficient Privileges:** The attacker needs either `delete` or `suppressrevision` rights on *any* wiki in the farm.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was present in the `RequestWikiRequestViewer.php` file.
* The issue was identified and resolved in commit `3415c1` and in issue tracker item T11999.
* A workaround involved disabling `Special:RequestWikiQueue` outside of the wiki where wiki requests are received, as seen in the commit `fb3e68b` of the `mw-config` repository.
* The vulnerability was assigned a moderate severity with a CVSS score of 4.9, as it allowed for high confidentiality impact with a low attack complexity and requiring high privileges.
