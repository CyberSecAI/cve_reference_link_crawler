Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `cryo` library for deserializing objects in the Garden project. `cryo` has an insecure implementation of deserialization, making it susceptible to code injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability lies in `cryo`'s insecure deserialization process. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through serialized objects.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Garden does not properly validate the objects it deserializes, allowing malicious payloads to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the user's machine. This occurs when a malicious object is deserialized by `cryo`, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** The attack vector involves storing malicious serialized objects in Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources that are prefixed with `test-result` or `run-result`. These ConfigMaps are stored in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace.
- **Garden CLI Commands:** An attacker exploits the `garden test` or `garden run` commands to trigger the vulnerable deserialization process. When a user invokes these commands, cached results stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized using `cryo`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Kubernetes Cluster Access:** The attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. This access allows them to manipulate the `ConfigMap` resources.
- **User Interaction:**  The attack requires a user to execute a `garden test` or `garden run` command, triggering the deserialization of the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided information also includes the commit that removes the vulnerable `cryo` library, replacing it with standard JSON serialization. This commit includes the following key changes:
    - Removal of `cryo` dependency from `package.json`.
    - Changes to `run-results.ts` and `test-results.ts` to include a `resultFormatVersion` in the keys.
    - Modification of `serialization.ts` to replace `cryo` serialization with `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`.

- The advisory references [CVE-2018-3784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3784), which is another vulnerability related to insecure deserialization.

- The CVSS score is 8.3, indicating a high severity vulnerability, further confirming the risk of remote code execution.

- The patch is available in Garden versions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65.
