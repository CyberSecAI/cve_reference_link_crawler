# Arbitrary code execution vulnerability when using shared Kubernetes cluster

High

[twelvemo](/twelvemo)
published
GHSA-hm75-6vc9-8rpr
Oct 6, 2023

## Package

garden
(binary)

## Affected versions

< 0.13.17, < 0.12.65

## Patched versions

0.13.17, 0.12.65

## Description

### Impact

Garden has a dependency on the [cryo library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryo), which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization.

Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace.

When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

### Workarounds

No other workarounds available.

### References

See also [CVE-2018-3784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3784)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-44392
