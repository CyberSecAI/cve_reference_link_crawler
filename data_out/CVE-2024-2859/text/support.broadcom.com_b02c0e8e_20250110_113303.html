Affected CVE

CVE-2024-2859

| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | **BSA-2024-2560** |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | OpenSSH |
|  |  |

**Summary**

By default, SANnav OVA is shipped with root user login enabled.

**Product Affected**

All Brocade OVA SANnav versions

**Mitigation**

Starting with SANnav OVA version v2.3.0 and later versions, a root account is not required for installation and management of the SANnav.

If an administrator is uncomfortable allowing users to log in as root, then they can follow a best practice where root is disabled as shown below:

Best practice recommendation for use on SANnav OVA versions v2.3.0 and later:

> Step 1: Before installing SANnav, login as a root user and create a local sudo user.

> Step 2: Edit the OpenSSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd\_config) to disable root login (PermitRootLogin no).

> Step 3: Restart sshd (systemctl restart sshd).

> Step 4: Logout from root, and login as the created sudo user.

> Step 5: Start SANnav installation

**Credit**

* Brocade found the issue through internal penetration testing and fixed it in Brocade SANnav v2.3.0.
* Pierre Barre reported the issue to Brocade later.
