  "CVE-2023-37822": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WPA2-PSK used to secure the dedicated Eufy network is derived from the device's serial number through a weak process. Only the first six characters of the MD5 hash of the serial number are used to generate the key, which significantly reduces the key's entropy.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Weak WPA2-PSK generation algorithm, low entropy of the generated WPA2-PSK, password reuse, cleartext communication within the dedicated Eufy network, lack of network isolation, use of weak AES-ECB encryption, insecure key derivation for media encryption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker within the range of the Eufy network can recover the WPA2-PSK in approximately 20 seconds and gain unauthorized access to the network, intercepting all communications, including commands, video streams, and images. This allows for access to the end-user’s private network without any network connection needed.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the dedicated Eufy network. They can then execute a de-authentication attack on the Eufy device to capture the WPA2 handshake, and use a custom password list to crack the WPA2-PSK within 20 seconds. Additionally, the attacker can perform network pivoting to access the end-user’s private network.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in proximity to an Eufy device and must have the ability to perform a de-authentication attack and crack the WPA2 handshake."
    },
   {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WPA2-PSK is derived by computing the MD5 hash of the serial number, encoding the result using Base64, and taking the first eight bytes. However, a closer look revealed that only the first six characters of the MD5 hash affect the WPA2-PSK.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The key derivation process uses a non-secret variable (serial number), and a weak hashing function (MD5) to generate a WPA2-PSK that is only 24 bits of entropy.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a dictionary attack on the WPA2-PSK and gain access to the dedicated Eufy network within seconds using a custom password list.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker must be within the wireless range of the Eufy network. They can obtain a WPA2 handshake by de-authenticating an Eufy device, and then use a custom password list to crack the WPA2-PSK.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be in wireless range of the Eufy network and capable of performing a deauthentication attack."
