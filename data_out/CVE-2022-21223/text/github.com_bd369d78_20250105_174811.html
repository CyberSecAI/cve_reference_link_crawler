While CocoaPods would have seen this issue, moves the check into the core path of using the cocoapods-download api. We're supposed to assume clients would not always run the pre-process API:

```
      # preprocess download options
      #
      # Usage of this method is optional. concrete strategies should not
      # assume options are preprocessed for correct execution.
      #

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
