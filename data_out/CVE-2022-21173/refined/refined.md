### CVE-2022-21173
**Root cause of vulnerability:** Hidden functionality exists in the firmware of the affected devices that allows execution of arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control and inclusion of hidden functionality that can be abused by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:** A network-adjacent attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected device. This could lead to complete compromise of the device including data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks within the network.

**Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network (LAN side). No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
