{
  "Root cause": "The Bold Page Builder plugin for WordPress insufficiently sanitizes and escapes user-supplied input in the button URL.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Insufficient input sanitization",
    "Insufficient output escaping"
  ],
  "Impact": "Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject malicious web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user views the affected page, potentially leading to the following:\n\n- Account takeover\n- Sensitive data leakage\n- Redirection to malicious websites\n- Defacement of the website",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a button URL within the Bold Page Builder plugin.",
  "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with contributor-level permissions or higher."
