The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46971.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unconditional call to the `security_locked_down()` function within the `perf_event_open` syscall handler in the Linux kernel. The lockdown state was checked regardless of whether the `PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR` bit was set in `attr.sample_type`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unnecessary permission checks: The `security_locked_down()` hook was called even when its result would not be used, leading to redundant permission checks and audit logs.
- Inefficient resource use: The unnecessary calls to `security_locked_down()` cause the SELinux lockdown hook to perform checks that have no impact.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability did not pose a security risk in the traditional sense, such as enabling unauthorized access or privilege escalation. However, it could lead to:
- Bogus audit records
- Reduced performance due to unnecessary checks

**Attack vectors:**
This is not an exploitable vulnerability in the conventional sense. It is a flaw in the logic of the perf subsystem. An attacker does not need to actively exploit the vulnerability. The impact would be noticed simply by invoking the perf subsystem with `PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR` and an active SELinux policy with lockdown rules.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker doesn't need any specific capabilities or position. Any user able to use perf events with `PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR` and under a system with an SELinux policy with lockdown rules is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
The fix for the vulnerability involves checking the `attr.sample_type` first, and only calling `security_locked_down()` if the `PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR` bit is set. This prevents unnecessary checks and related performance or SELinux logging overhead.
