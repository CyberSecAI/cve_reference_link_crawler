{
  "CVE-2024-1351": {
    "Description": "In MongoDB 5.0 prior to 5.0.25, under certain configurations of `--tlsCAFile` and `CAFile`, MongoDB Server may skip peer certificate validation which may result in untrusted connections to succeed.",
    "Root cause": "Improper certificate validation. MongoDB Server may skip peer certificate validation if the server is started with TLS enabled but without a `net.tls.CAFile` configured.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-295"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to untrusted connections succeeding. This may effectively reduce the security guarantees provided by TLS and open connections that should have been closed due to failing certificate validation.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can establish a connection to a vulnerable MongoDB server using a forged certificate.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable MongoDB server. No specific authentication is needed due to the bypass of the peer certificate validation."
