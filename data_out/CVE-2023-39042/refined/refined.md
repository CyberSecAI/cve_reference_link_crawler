Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The mini-app 'Gyouza-newhushimi' on Line exposes the 'client secret' in the response of the API request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`. This secret is intended to be kept confidential.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the 'client secret' to unauthorized actors through the API response. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows access to credentials.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The content implies that the client secret is likely hardcoded within the application or its backend configuration and not properly protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** The exposed 'client secret' can be used to obtain a 'channel access token'. This token is responsible for securing communication within the Line platform.
*   **Malicious Broadcasts:** With the 'channel access token', an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to all users of the 'Gyouza-newhushimi' mini-app. This could include phishing links, fraud information, or other harmful content.
*   **Compromised Communication Channel:** The vulnerability compromises the security of the communication channel within Line for this specific mini-app.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The 'client secret' is exposed in the HTTP response to the `userEntry` API endpoint, so passive network sniffing would potentially reveal the secret.
*   **Client-Side Extraction:** An attacker could also inspect the response within the application or using a proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Line User:** The attacker needs a Line account to access and interact with the vulnerable mini-app.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network traffic that the mini-app generates or the ability to intercept responses from the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Tooling:** The attacker needs a basic HTTP client to make requests and view the server response. The attacker also requires access to the Line platform's channel access token API (as shown in Figure 2).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** 'Gyouza-newhushimi' mini-app on Line.
*   **Affected Version:** v13.6.1
*   The vulnerability is easily exploitable; as it only requires having Line installed and opening the vulnerable mini-app.
