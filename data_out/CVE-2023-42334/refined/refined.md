Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The application directly uses user-provided input to access files without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Authorization:** The application fails to verify if the user is authorized to access the requested file. It directly uses the file identifier provided in the request without validating user permissions.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application uses direct references to files via parameters in requests, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can access files that they are not authorized to view.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored within the files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulating File Identifiers:** An attacker can intercept a legitimate request for a file and modify the file identifier parameter to point to another file.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by manipulating HTTP requests, likely through the app's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Fl3xx Crew or Fl3xx Dispatch application.
*   **HTTP Proxy:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a tool like Burp Suite.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Fl3xx Dispatch and Fl3xx Crew applications version 2.10.37
*   The report details the steps taken to identify and exploit this vulnerability: capturing a legitimate file request, modifying the file identifier parameter, and observing the unauthorized access to different files.
