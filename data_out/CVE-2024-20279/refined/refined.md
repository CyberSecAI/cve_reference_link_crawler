- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control within the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco APIC, specifically when used to implement multi-tenancy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access control allows users associated with restricted security domains to modify default system policies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies (e.g., QoS policies). This can disrupt network traffic, as these policies are used by all tenants in the fabric.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain with **port-mgmt** permissions.
