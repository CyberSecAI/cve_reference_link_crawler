This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-cousmo-uBpBYGbq>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco APIC if restricted security domains were configured with associated users that have **port-mgmt** permissions.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine Restricted Security Domain Configuration and User Port-Mgmt Permissions To determine whether restricted security domains are configured, run the **moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dn** command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   apic1# moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dndn     : uni/userext/domain-company1dn     : uni/userext/domain-company2   ```  To determine whether users have **port-mgmt** permissions, run the **moquery -c aaaUserRole -f 'aaa.UserRole.name=="port-mgmt"' | egrep dn** command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   apic1# moquery -c aaaUserRole -f 'aaa.UserRole.name=="port-mgmt"' | egrep dndn     : uni/userext/user-company1-admin/userdomain-all/role-port-mgmtdn     : uni/userext/user-company2-admin/userdomain-all/role-port-mgmt   ```  The configuration is affected by this vulnerability only if a user with **port-mgmt** permissions is associated with a restricted security domain. For the configuration to be affected by this vulnerability, entries must be returned by both the queries above. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Cloud Network Controller, formerly known as Cloud APIC.  Details  * Restricted security domains are used to provide multi-tenancy capabilities in policies and profiles outside the tenant level. Even if these policies and profiles do not belong to any tenant, by using separate restricted security domains for each tenant, users from each tenant can create policies and profiles that are hidden to users in other tenants.  For more information about restricting access using security domains, see the [Cisco APIC Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/6x/security-configuration/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-60x/restricting-access-using-security-domains-and-node-rules-60x.html?cachemode=refresh).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
