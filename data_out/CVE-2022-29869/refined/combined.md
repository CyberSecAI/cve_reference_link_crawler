# LinuxCIFS utils: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202311-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LinuxCIFS utils, the worst of which can lead to local root privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/cifs-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.15** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.15** |

### Background

The LinuxCIFS utils are a collection of tools for managing Linux CIFS Client Filesystems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LinuxCIFS utils. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.
When verbose logging is enabled, invalid credentials file lines may be dumped to stderr. This may lead to information disclosure in particular conditions when the credentials file given is sensitive and contains '=' signs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-7fda04ab5a
2022-05-09 01:35:33.152513
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : cifs-utils
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 6.15
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <http://linux-cifs.samba.org/cifs-utils/>
Summary : Utilities for mounting and managing CIFS mounts
Description :
The SMB/CIFS protocol is a standard file sharing protocol widely deployed
on Microsoft Windows machines. This package contains tools for mounting
shares on Linux using the SMB/CIFS protocol. The tools in this package
work in conjunction with support in the kernel to allow one to mount a
SMB/CIFS share onto a client and use it as if it were a standard Linux
file system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is a security release to address the following bugs: - CVE-2022-27239:
mount.cifs: fix length check for ip option parsing - CVE-2022-29869: mount.cifs:
fix verbose messages on option parsing Description CVE-2022-27239: In cifs-
utils through 6.14, a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs
ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.
CVE-2022-29869: cifs-utils through 6.14, with verbose logging, can cause an
information leak when a file contains = (equal sign) characters but is not a
valid credentials file. Both issues were originally reported and fixed by
Jeffrey Bencteux.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-eb2d3ca94d
2022-05-07 04:08:14.319085
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : cifs-utils
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 6.15
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <http://linux-cifs.samba.org/cifs-utils/>
Summary : Utilities for mounting and managing CIFS mounts
Description :
The SMB/CIFS protocol is a standard file sharing protocol widely deployed
on Microsoft Windows machines. This package contains tools for mounting
shares on Linux using the SMB/CIFS protocol. The tools in this package
work in conjunction with support in the kernel to allow one to mount a
SMB/CIFS share onto a client and use it as if it were a standard Linux
file system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is a security release to address the following bugs: - CVE-2022-27239:
mount.cifs: fix length check for ip option parsing - CVE-2022-29869: mount.cifs:
fix verbose messages on option parsing Description CVE-2022-27239: In cifs-
utils through 6.14, a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs
ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.
CVE-2022-29869: cifs-utils through 6.14, with verbose logging, can cause an
information leak when a file contains = (equal sign) characters but is not a
valid credentials file. Both issues were originally reported and fixed by
Jeffrey Bencteux.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-34de4f833d
2022-05-09 01:11:14.497710
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : cifs-utils
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 6.15
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://linux-cifs.samba.org/cifs-utils/>
Summary : Utilities for mounting and managing CIFS mounts
Description :
The SMB/CIFS protocol is a standard file sharing protocol widely deployed
on Microsoft Windows machines. This package contains tools for mounting
shares on Linux using the SMB/CIFS protocol. The tools in this package
work in conjunction with support in the kernel to allow one to mount a
SMB/CIFS share onto a client and use it as if it were a standard Linux
file system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is a security release to address the following bugs: - CVE-2022-27239:
mount.cifs: fix length check for ip option parsing - CVE-2022-29869: mount.cifs:
fix verbose messages on option parsing Description CVE-2022-27239: In cifs-
utils through 6.14, a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs
ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.
CVE-2022-29869: cifs-utils through 6.14, with verbose logging, can cause an
information leak when a file contains = (equal sign) characters but is not a
valid credentials file. Both issues were originally reported and fixed by
Jeffrey Bencteux.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
