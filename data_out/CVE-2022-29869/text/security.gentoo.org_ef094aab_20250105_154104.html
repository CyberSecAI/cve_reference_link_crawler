Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LinuxCIFS utils, the worst of which can lead to local root privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/cifs-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |

### Background

The LinuxCIFS utils are a collection of tools for managing Linux CIFS Client Filesystems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LinuxCIFS utils. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs ip= command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.
