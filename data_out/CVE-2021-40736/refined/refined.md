Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-40736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer", which is described as a CWE-788. This indicates a buffer overflow or similar memory access error where the program attempts to read or write to a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core weakness is an out-of-bounds memory access (CWE-788). Specifically, the program is accessing memory locations after the end of a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to "Arbitrary code execution". This allows an attacker to potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is described by the CVSS vector string "AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Local):** The attacker needs to be local to the vulnerable system.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to execute the attack.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope remains unchanged.
    *   **C:H (High):** The impact to confidentiality is high.
    *   **I:H (High):** The impact to integrity is high.
    *   **A:H (High):** The impact to availability is high.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be local to the system.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to perform an action (user interaction), likely involving opening a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-40736 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe Audition where a buffer overflow (or similar out-of-bounds access) can lead to arbitrary code execution. The attacker needs to be local to the system and requires user interaction to trigger the exploit, such as opening a malicious file. This vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
