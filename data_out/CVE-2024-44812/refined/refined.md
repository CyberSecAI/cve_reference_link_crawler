{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the username and password parameters within the admin login page are vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the authentication process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative privileges, leading to full access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the login page at `/admin.index.php`, where the username and password parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs network access to the application and does not require any prior privileges."
