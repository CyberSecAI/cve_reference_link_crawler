The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30274.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Motorola Solutions ACE1000 device communicates with an XRT Lan-to-radio gateway using an embedded client. The credentials for this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a hardcoded key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key to encrypt the credentials for the XRT Lan-to-radio gateway communication.
- The use of ECB mode encryption, which is vulnerable to attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially manipulate the device configuration by decrypting the credentials, which leads to unauthorized access and modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the device.
- Ability to intercept the encrypted credentials.
- Knowledge of the hardcoded key and encryption algorithm used.
