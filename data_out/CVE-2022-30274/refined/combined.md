##### MOTOTRBO™ Capacity Max

### Overview

**High-performance, Next Generation Digital Trunking**

The MOTOTRBO Capacity Max trunked radio system is built on a distributed architecture for voice and data. Control is centralized, but traffic routing is optimized to minimize cost and maximize performance.

Capacity Max goes beyond the core interoperability of the DMR standard to bring you enhanced functionality. Features and applications such as Digital Emergency, call queuing prioritization and over-the-air programming give you the tools you need to make your business successful.

**Central Management for Complete Control**

Capacity Max gives you centralized control of everything you need to manage your system. System management software gives you command of infrastructure, devices and talk groups, all organized in a logical way to make you more efficient and effective. Updating and upgrading is easier too, with processes for pushing out software and firmware patches to the system server, infrastructure and radios.

**High Security**

Security is a core component of the Capacity Max trunked radio system. All voice, data and control traffic within the IP network is encrypted, and all radios are securely authenticated. You can even remotely disable and re-enable a device if it is misplaced or stolen.

**Easy Migration**

Capacity Max fits seamlessly into existing MOTOTRBO systems, allowing you to easily transition to Capacity Max via a simple, software update.

**Increased Capacity, Smooth Scalability**

MOTOTRBO Capacity Max makes it easy for you to grow your system as your needs evolve. A system can support up to 750 sites with up to 3,000 users per site.

Up to six additional data repeaters per site can be dedicated to support intensive data use for texting, GPS location updates, SCADA and other applications such as personnel management and alarm notifications. Compatible with our wide portfolio of MOTOTRBO radios, you have the flexibility to tailor the solution to your operations.

**Advanced Functionality**

The system supports all the innovative features you’d expect from MOTOTRBO, from advanced location tracking to long text messaging, enhanced security and roaming. For customers who need a system that supports other vendors’ radios,

**High Resiliency, High Availability**

The Capacity Max trunked radio system has been designed for high performance, high availability and high resiliency. Optional redundant system servers, IP switches and on-site control channel repeaters can be added to provide multiple layers of redundancy and help ensure that no single failure can bring your system down. You can also provision up to three alternate control channels per site for ultra-high system availability.

ICS Advisory
# Motorola Solutions ACE1000

Last RevisedJune 28, 2022
Alert CodeICSA-22-179-06

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Motorola Solutions
* **Equipment:** ACE1000
* **Vulnerabilities:** Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity

CISA is aware of a public report, known as “OT:ICEFALL” that details vulnerabilities found in multiple operational technology (OT) vendors. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to manipulate the RTU configuration, cause a denial-of-service condition, or achieve remote code execution.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of ACE1000, a remote terminal unit, are affected:

* Motorola Solutions ACE1000: All versions

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

The affected product ships with a hardcoded SSH private key and initialization scripts (such as /etc/init.d/sshd\_service) only generate a new key if no such file yet exists. As such, this hard-coded key is likely to be used by default. This could allow an attacker to remotely execute code, manipulate configuration, or cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2022-30271](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30271) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

The affected product SSH service is controlled by five preconfigured accounts, all of which come with default hard-coded credentials. This could allow an attacker to manipulate configuration, remotely execute code, and cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2022-30270](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30270) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

The affected device communicates with an XRT Lan-to-radio gateway by means of an embedded client. Credentials for accessing this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the tiny encryption algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a hardcoded key, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the device configuration.

[CVE-2022-30274](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30274) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)).

#### 3.2.4    [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)

The affected product allows for custom application installation via STS software, the C toolkit, or the ACE1000 Easy Configurator. Application images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks. This could allow an authenticated attacker to run remote code execution or cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2022-30269](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30269) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.5    [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)

An attacker capable of communicating with and authenticating to a Motorola ACE1000 RTU via SSH or Web UI could push malicious firmware images to the RTU, which could allow firmware manipulation, remote code execution, and a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2022-30272](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-30272) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics).
