##### MOTOTRBO™ Capacity Max

### Overview

**High-performance, Next Generation Digital Trunking**

The MOTOTRBO Capacity Max trunked radio system is built on a distributed architecture for voice and data. Control is centralized, but traffic routing is optimized to minimize cost and maximize performance.

Capacity Max goes beyond the core interoperability of the DMR standard to bring you enhanced functionality. Features and applications such as Digital Emergency, call queuing prioritization and over-the-air programming give you the tools you need to make your business successful.

**Central Management for Complete Control**

Capacity Max gives you centralized control of everything you need to manage your system. System management software gives you command of infrastructure, devices and talk groups, all organized in a logical way to make you more efficient and effective. Updating and upgrading is easier too, with processes for pushing out software and firmware patches to the system server, infrastructure and radios.

**High Security**

Security is a core component of the Capacity Max trunked radio system. All voice, data and control traffic within the IP network is encrypted, and all radios are securely authenticated. You can even remotely disable and re-enable a device if it is misplaced or stolen.

**Easy Migration**

Capacity Max fits seamlessly into existing MOTOTRBO systems, allowing you to easily transition to Capacity Max via a simple, software update.

**Increased Capacity, Smooth Scalability**

MOTOTRBO Capacity Max makes it easy for you to grow your system as your needs evolve. A system can support up to 750 sites with up to 3,000 users per site.

Up to six additional data repeaters per site can be dedicated to support intensive data use for texting, GPS location updates, SCADA and other applications such as personnel management and alarm notifications. Compatible with our wide portfolio of MOTOTRBO radios, you have the flexibility to tailor the solution to your operations.

**Advanced Functionality**

The system supports all the innovative features you’d expect from MOTOTRBO, from advanced location tracking to long text messaging, enhanced security and roaming. For customers who need a system that supports other vendors’ radios,

**High Resiliency, High Availability**

The Capacity Max trunked radio system has been designed for high performance, high availability and high resiliency. Optional redundant system servers, IP switches and on-site control channel repeaters can be added to provide multiple layers of redundancy and help ensure that no single failure can bring your system down. You can also provision up to three alternate control channels per site for ultra-high system availability.
