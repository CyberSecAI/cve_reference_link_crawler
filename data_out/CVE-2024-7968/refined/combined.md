We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Google is aware that exploits for CVE-2024-7971 and CVE-2024-7965 exist in the wild.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[361165957](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361165957)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/), [libFuzzer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/testing/libfuzzer/README.md), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
