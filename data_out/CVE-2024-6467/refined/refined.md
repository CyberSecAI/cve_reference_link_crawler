**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the 'bookingpress\_save\_lite\_wizard\_settings\_func' function within the BookingPress plugin, which is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and creation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read the content of arbitrary files, either locally or from remote locations.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** Attackers can create arbitrary files with attacker-controlled content.
- **External Control of File Name or Path:** The plugin allows manipulation of the file path during creation, leading to the ability to overwrite existing files or create files in arbitrary locations within the web server's filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can create PHP files with malicious code and execute them on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive information from files on the server.
- **Complete system compromise:** The ability to read and write arbitrary files could potentially lead to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the vulnerable `bookingpress_save_lite_wizard_settings_func` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with at least Subscriber-level access or higher within the WordPress installation.
