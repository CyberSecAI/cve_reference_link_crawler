- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server does not properly validate the `StartTransaction` message, accepting additional, arbitrary properties, and when duplicate properties are provided, it accepts the last occurrence without validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unvalidated input: The server accepts and processes messages with extra, unexpected properties.
    - Duplicate property handling: The server uses the last occurrence of a duplicate property, potentially overwriting expected values.
    - Lack of message schema enforcement: The server does not reject messages that deviate from the expected schema.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Potential misconfigurations: Malicious actors can manipulate the values used by the server by sending messages with duplicate properties.
    - Unpredictable system behavior: Accepting arbitrary properties may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    - Altered transaction records: Exploiting the vulnerability could lead to modifying transaction data.
    - System integrity impact: Could potentially impact the overall integrity and reliability of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted `StartTransaction` messages with:
    - Additional arbitrary properties.
    - Duplicate properties with malicious values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the server, implying a position on the network that allows communication with the vulnerable system.
