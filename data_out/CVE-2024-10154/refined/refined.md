Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10154:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `status.php` file of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0. Specifically, the `emailid` parameter, used when checking the booking status, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sufficient neutralization of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application constructs SQL queries using unvalidated input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as customer information, booking details, or other private records.
- **Integrity compromise:** Modification or deletion of database records by the attacker, potentially causing data corruption or loss.
- **Availability impact:**  Denial of service or application downtime if the attacker manipulates the database to render the application unstable or unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `emailid` parameter in the `status.php` file when a user attempts to check their boat booking status. The attacker can send a crafted HTTP request containing SQL injection payloads within this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only requires network access to the application. No authentication or special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability. They can be any user who is able to submit a request to the `status.php` script.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, using tools such as Burp Suite.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub content confirms that the vulnerability is present in the `status.php` file, and the vulnerable parameter is indeed `emailid`.
- The attacker can use tools like `sqlmap` to automatically discover and exploit this SQL injection vulnerability, which is also indicated in the GitHub content.
- The VulDB entry confirms that the vulnerability is related to SQL injection, with a submission specifically targeting this issue.
