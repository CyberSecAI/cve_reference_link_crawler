The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in mojoPortal version 2.7.0.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the File Manager function, allowing a remote attacker to upload a compressed archive containing a malicious webshell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, insufficient input validation, arbitrary file extraction
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading and extracting a malicious webshell via the File Manager, leading to complete compromise of the server
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uploads a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP) containing a webshell (e.g., an ashx file) through the File Manager functionality, then extracts the archive using the same interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the File Manager function of the vulnerable mojoPortal instance.
