- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow in the `fromSafeClientFilter` function of Tenda FH1201 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `fromSafeClientFilter` function uses `sprintf` to construct a URL with a user-supplied `page` parameter without proper bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `/goform/SafeClientFilter` endpoint, by providing an overly long string as the value of the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. The attacker must know the router's IP address and have network access.
