# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1641

## FreshTomato httpd logs/view.cgi OS command injection vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-42484

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the httpd logs/view.cgi functionality of FreshTomato 2022.5. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

FreshTomato 2022.5

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

AdvancedTomato commit 67273b0

##### PRODUCT URLS

FreshTomato - <https://www.freshtomato.org/>
QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

FreshTomato is an open source firmware based on linux. The firmware offers several features for Broadcom-based routers.

The FreshTomato’s httpd component offers several APIs. One is called `logs/view.cgi` and is used to query/view the log files.

One of the functions responsible for performing this API is `wo_viewlog`:

```
void wo_viewlog(char *url)
{
    char *p;
    char *c;
    char s[128];
    char t[128];
    int n;
    char lfn[256];

    if (!logok())
        return;

    get_logfilename(lfn);
    if ((p = webcgi_get("find")) != NULL) {                                                             [1]
            send_header(200, NULL, mime_plain, 0);
            if (strlen(p) > 64)
                return;

            c = t;
            while (*p) {
                    switch (*p) {
                    case '<':
                    case '>':
                    case '|':
                    case '"':
                    case '\\':
                        *c++ = '\\';
                        *c++ = *p;
                        break;
                    default:
                        if (isprint(*p))
                            *c++ = *p;
                        break;
                    }
                    ++p;
            }
            *c = 0;
            snprintf(s, sizeof(s), "grep -ih \"%s\" $(ls -1rv %s %s.*)", t, lfn, lfn);                  [2]
            web_pipecmd(s, WOF_NONE);                                                                   [3]
            return;
    }

    if ((p = webcgi_get("which")) == NULL)
        return;

    if (strcmp(p, "all") == 0)
        n = MAX_LOG_LINES;
    else if ((n = atoi(p)) <= 0)
        return;

    send_header(200, NULL, mime_plain, 0);
    snprintf(s, sizeof(s), "cat $(ls -1rv %s %s.*) | tail -n %d", lfn, lfn, n);
    web_pipecmd(s, WOF_NONE);
}

```

This function will fetch, at `[1]`, the `find` parameter. If it exists, eventually, the instruction at `[2]` will be executed. This instruction will compose the string `grep -ih \"<parsed find parameter>\" $(ls -1rv <logfilename> <logfilename>.*)`, which will be used at `[3]` for the `web_pipecmd` function that will call the `popen` function and print out the results.

Because no real sanitization is performed against the `find` parameter, this function is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability and can lead to arbitrary command execution.
