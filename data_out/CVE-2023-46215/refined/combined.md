Subject: CVE-2023-46215: Apache Airflow Celery provider, Apache Airflow:
 Sensitive information logged as clear text when rediss, amqp, rpc
 protocols are used as Celery result backend

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow Celery provider 3.3.0 through 3.4.0
- Apache Airflow 1.10.0 before 2.7.0

Description:

Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in Apache Airflow Celery provider, Apache Airflow.

Sensitive information logged as clear text when rediss, amqp, rpc protocols are used as Celery result backend
Note: the vulnerability is about the information exposed in the logs not about accessing the logs.

This issue affects Apache Airflow Celery provider: from 3.3.0 through 3.4.0; Apache Airflow: from 1.10.0 through 2.6.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade Airflow Celery provider to version 3.4.1 and Apache Airlfow to version 2.7.0 which fixes the issue.
