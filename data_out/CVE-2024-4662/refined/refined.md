Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Oxygen Builder plugin stores custom data in post metadata without using an underscore prefix. This allows lower-privileged users to directly modify this data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data stored in post metadata, leading to a code injection vulnerability. Specifically, arbitrary PHP code can be injected via post metadata.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Lower-privileged users (specifically "Contributor" role or higher) can inject code that could lead to privilege escalation to an admin role.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious PHP code into post metadata. This could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges from Contributor or higher to an admin user, gaining full control of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Post Metadata Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating post metadata through the WordPress user interface.
*   **Authenticated Access:**  Attackers need to have an account with at least Contributor role privileges on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a user with at least "Contributor" role permissions.
*   **Access to WordPress Interface:** The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin interface to modify post metadata.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francesco Carlucci, who initially found a similar issue in the Breakdance plugin.
*   The vendor, Soflyy, was alerted to the vulnerability on May 7th and released a fix in version 4.8.3.
*   The vendor states that there are no known instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time of writing.
