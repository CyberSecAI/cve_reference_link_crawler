                            <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Periodic Password Integrity Check</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro now introduces Periodic Password Integrity Check for resource groups. This feature enables administrators to schedule password integrity checks on a specific day/time, at regular intervals of the specified day(s), or on a particular day of a month. The password integrity check will run periodically based on the schedule configured. Unlike the existing on-demand check for password integrity, this new option enables administrators to automate and customize password verification for a group of resources at convenient schedules.
                                </li>
                                 <li>
                                    <p><strong>Certificates Synchronization Status Check</strong></p>
                                    From now on, Password Manager Pro allows you to perform regular checks on the synchronization status of SSL certificates deployed to multiple servers directly. Additionally, you can schedule the synchronization check and generate a 'Certificate Sync Status' report based on the results.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Certificate Tools</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro now comes with the 'Certificate Tools' feature under 'SSL Certificates' that will allow users to independently perform certificate conversion, SSL/CSR parsing, and vulnerability scanning without adding certificates into the Password Manager Pro repository.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p><strong>CSR and SSL Parser</strong> -  Upload certificates or their contents directly to the interface and sort the attributes into a readable format.</p>

By leveraging the MSCA feature, administrators can perform the operations including, certificate request, discovery, renewal, export, revoke, and delete.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Password Manager Pro - Azure Key Vault Integration</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro now supports integration with Microsoft Azure Key Vault - an SSL certificate management service offered by Microsoft. Through this integration, users can request, renew, and manage the entire lifecycle of SSL/TLS certificates stored in the Azure Key Vault by importing them into the Password Manager Pro repository.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro now integrates with Sectigo Certificate Manager - a PKI management platform built to manage SSL/TLS certificates, SSH keys, and other digital identities. The integration facilitates users to request, acquire, import, deploy, and renew certificates issued by Sectigo and automate their end-to-end lifecycle management of SSL/TLS certificates directly from the Password Manager Pro web interface.
                                </li>

                                    <p><strong>Importing Certificate Details</strong></p>
                                    Besides adding certificate objects in different formats, Password Manager Pro now allows users to add certificate details into the Password Manager Pro repository manually and manage them along with other certificate objects. This feature is beneficial when a user has the details of an SSL certificate that resides in a demilitarized zone and therefore, cannot be added to Password Manager Pro as an object through discovery. In this case, users can create a CSV file with the specified certificate details and upload them to Password Manager Pro. Furthermore, users can also set up expiry notifications for certificate details.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    From build 13000, Password Manager Pro allows you to check the SyncStatus using SSL Agent. For this to work, the SSL agent should also be updated to version 13000.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Earlier, certificates were managed based on their Serial Number. Now, certificates having the same common name and different serial numbers can be grouped by enabling it under 'Manage Certificate History' under 'Admin >> SSL Certificates >> Certificate History'.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    From now on, the old certificate will be listed under 'Certificate History' after the certificate renewal.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    From now on, Password Manager Pro allows you to add additional properties to CSR while signing with root by using the 'Advanced Options' menu. It allows users to choose from a list of Key Usage and Advanced Key Usage properties and add them to the new certificate.

                                <li>
                                    Earlier, during certificate deployment using IIS Binding, users could deploy it to a single server or agent only. From now on, users will be able to deploy certificates to multiple servers as well.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Henceforth, users will be able to export the private key from the Microsoft Certificate store after certificate deployment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    From now on, besides deploying to the computer account, Password Manager Pro allows you to deploy certificates to the Microsoft certificate store user account using the SSL agent. The latest version of the SSL agent should run in the user account to which the certificates are to be deployed.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                            <p>In build 12431, there were two identified issues that have been successfully addressed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Previously, the account details view of any resource displayed all accounts shared with the user, regardless of the specific resource. This issue has been resolved to ensure that users only see relevant account details
                                    associated with the resource they are accessing.
                                </li>
                                <li>For users managing multiple organizations, the favorites and recently accessed tabs within an organization were displaying all accounts, irrespective of the currently managed organization. This has been rectified to show
                                    only the accounts relevant to the organization currently in focus, ensuring a more streamlined organizational management experience.

                            <p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
                            <p>Password Manager Pro introduces Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) support for accounts utilizing TOTP as the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Now, administrators can effortlessly generate TOTP codes for website accounts
                                configured with 2FA directly from the shared TOTP secrets stored within Password Manager Pro. This means users can conveniently access privileged accounts, complete with passwords and TOTP codes, all from within the Password
                                Manager Pro interface. Additionally, a new REST API endpoint, 'Fetch TOTP of an Account,' allows API users to retrieve TOTP codes using the respective account ID. This update streamlines the authentication processes and
                                bolsters security measures, elevating both efficiency and user experience.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>From build 12100 onwards, the password verification process via PKI authentication for Linux accounts failed to identify the out-of-sync passwords. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Previously, during advanced configurations for ServiceDesk Plus, the conditions to be checked for the ticketing system failed to match the results. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Resolved an issue where changing a password using an API failed if the new password contained the '[' character, which was not recognized as a special character according to the strong password policy.</li>
                                <li>Previously, when a user was granted access control approval privilege through user groups rather than directly at the user level, attempting to approve an access control request via the Password Manager Pro mobile application
                                    resulted in a failure with an unauthorized access error message. This issue has now been fixed.</li>

                                <li>Previously, in the Auto Approval scenario for access control, the password was not checked-in automatically after the specified time. This issue has been fixed.</li>

                                    Unlike a High Availability set up, where there is one Primary and Secondary server each, the RO server can be configured in multiple numbers. The RO servers function as mirror servers, synchronizing all of the Primary
                                    server's operations. In the event of the Primary server failure, administrators can convert any RO server into the Primary server and reconfigure all other RO servers to point to the new Primary server. You can configure
                                    RO Server from 'Admin &gt;&gt; Configurations &gt;&gt; RO Server.'

                                <li>Password Manager Pro will now display the list of agents mapped to the resources under 'Admin &gt;&gt; PMP Agents &gt;&gt; Manage Agents'. Resource owners can view, associate, disassociate, and delete their respective agents
                                    from the 'Manage Agents' page. Also, if an existing resource is deleted accidentally, the administrator can remap an agent to the resource with the same DNS name as the agent.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, Password Manager Pro allowed the administrators to execute the scripts post password reset in agentless mode only. Now, the administrators can execute the scripts both with and without the agent before and after

                                <li>From build 12200 onwards, during a remote MSSQL session, users were unable to switch the connection to a different database. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
                                <li>From build 12200 onwards, users were unable to execute the Insert, Update, and Delete queries during a remote session launched to any SQL database. This issue has been fixed now.</li>

                                <li>Previously, export passwords as plain-text (.xlsx) failed when there were more than thirty-two thousand passwords in the export list. This issue has been fixed now.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier in the MSP edition, when a user mapped with a client organization was removed from a user group, the user still had access to the client organization. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Security Fix</strong></p>
                            <p>Previously, the Password Manager Pro agent communicated with the Password Manager Pro server without ascertaining its SSL certificate validity in the following aspects, thereby increasing the risk of external exploitation:<br>
                                <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                    <li>If the certificate installed is currently valid</li>
                                    <li>If the certificate is from a trusted CA</li>
                                    <li>If the name on the certificate and the site matches</li>
                                </ul>
                                From now on, the PMP agent will verify if a valid SSL certificate has been installed on the Password Manager Pro server before commencing the communication, thus strengthening security.

                            <p>Password Manager Pro now supports OAuth 2.0 authentication for SMTP-based email communications when using Microsoft Exchange Online. Users can configure Microsoft Exchange Online as the mail server through which Password Manager
                                Pro sends email notifications. Users can choose Microsoft Exchange Online under 'Admin &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Mail Server Settings' to activate OAuth 2.0 authentication for all emails sent from Password Manager Pro.</p>

                                <li>Earlier, users could not reset the Personal Passphrases set up by them earlier from the Personal tab. Henceforth, users will be able to reset their Personal Passphrases, but also the action will permanently remove all the

                                <li>Earlier, from the Resources tab, users could not take remote connections to resources that did not contain any user account using domain credentials. This issue has been fixed. </li>
                                <li>From build 12121, administrators could not save the edited email templates if the message contained a hyperlink tag. This issue has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From build 12121, administrators could not save the edited Access Control templates. This issue has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From build 12100, when modifying the domain information in the Active Directory Synchronization schedule, the 'Domain Details' window did not load if a resource name with a special character was chosen. This issue has been
                                    fixed.

                                    has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In some customer environments, when administrators performed password reset for domain accounts, the passwords got updated in the Active Directory, but the changes did not reflect in the Password Manager Pro database. This
                                    issue has been fixed.

                            <p>Password Manager Pro will no longer support both the 32 and 64-bit versions of the C++ agent for Windows and Windows Domain systems and the C Agent for Linux. The C and C++ agents will still be functional in the older versions
                                of Password Manager Pro past this date. But, we highly recommend using the C# agent for Windows and Windows Domain machines and the Go agent for Linux machines due to their better stability and the additional features they
                                offer, such as dynamic account filtering.

                                <li>Two new fields - PMP User Full Name and PMP User Email Id have been added to the 'Column Name' drop-down under 'Ticketing System &gt;&gt; Advanced configurations'. This will allow administrators to configure the ticketing
                                    system to validate tickets based on User Full Name and Email Id. </li>
                                <li>Earlier, while configuring access control, under auto approval, users were only able to set the later/to time up to 23:55 in a day. Henceforth, the users will be able to set the later/to time to 00:00.</li>

                                <li>Password Manager Pro will no longer support Microsoft NTLM Single Sign-on (SSO) as an authentication method as we are officially discontinuing support for it. Though NTLM SSO may work in previous Password Manager Pro versions,
                                    we recommend switching to the other authentication methods such as SAML SSO that we will continue to support.</li>
                                <li>Hereafter, the PostgreSQL superuser password will be auto-generated and encrypted for every new instance of Password Manager Pro and will be maintained in the 'database_params.conf' file.</li>
                                <li>The authentication mechanism of the Jira Service Desk has been updated from the older Authtoken-based method to OAuth 2.0.<br>
                                    <strong>Note:</strong> If your current ticketing system is Jira Service Desk, this upgrade pack will disable the integration and delete the entire integration data. As a result, you will have to reconfigure the ticketing
                                    system. We recommend you save a copy of the advanced configuration details as screenshots for future reference.

                                <li>From build 12100, the windows scheduled task discovery did not work due to an internal issue. This issue has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From build 12005, RSA Two-Factor Authentication did not work after upgrading Apache Log4j JAR file. This issue has been fixed.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Earlier, the users could only configure SAML for the Primary server as the service provider. From now on, the Secondary server can be set up as a separate service provider, allowing users to log in to the Secondary server
                                    using SAML when the Primary server is down/unavailable. </li>
                                <li>The API handling code is enhanced to support the V3 API format of ServiceDesk Plus MSP.
                                </li>
                                <li>Dropbox SDK has been updated from version 3.0.3 to version 5.0.0. From now on, a short-lived access token will be used.</li>
                                <li>Administrators can now enable and set up a customizable welcome message once a session commences. In addition, they can enable the session recording status in the session window. </li>
                                <li>Earlier, Password Manager Pro did not have any approval process for VNC passwords. Hereafter, Password Manager Pro will allow validations, such as Access Control and Helpdesk for VNC passwords.<br>
                                    <strong>Note:</strong> After upgrading to 12100, all VNC resource passwords will be added to an account - "_VNCACCOUNT_" under their respective resources. Users can take VNC connections directly from this account for
                                    the respective resources.
                                </li>
                                <li>From build 12100, the Password Manager Pro administrators can modify the messages in access control workflow dialog using message templates.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, users could auto-logon to resources using the logged-in AD account alone. From now on, auto-logon is possible through the logged-in LDAP and Azure AD user accounts as well.</li>
                                <li><strong>MFA Reset Option for Privileged Administrators</strong><br> From build 12100, administrators can reset Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users, and the users will also be able to reset MFA for themselves.</li>
                                <li><strong>SAML Single Logout</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports SAML Single Logout, which automatically terminates all related sessions established using SAML SSO once the user logs out from the PMP UI.</li>
                                <li><strong>New REST API</strong><br> A new REST API, 'Reset Two-Factor Authentication', has been added. It is of ideal use for REST API users with an admin role or a custom role with admin operation to automatically reset
                                    the Two-Factor Authentication configured for the end-users by supplying their username - for example, when a user loses their phone configured with Password Manager Pro MFA. </li>
                                <li>In addition to TLS 1.1 protocol, Password Manager Pro now communicates to agents through TLS 1.2 protocol.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Before the upgrade, if the browser 'Autofill' option was enabled, it is possible for the saved passwords from the browser to get auto-populated in the 'VNC Passwords' field. After the 12100 upgrade, all the VNC resource
                                    passwords will be added to an account called '_VNCACCOUNT_' under their respective resources.
                                    <div class="yellownote"><span class="boldtxt">Attention: </span>When the users take VNC connections directly from the '_VNCACCOUNT_' of the respective resources, with the browser autofill option, the VNC passwords of the resources may be visible
                                        to users along with their shared resources. Therefore, we highly recommend you verify the VNC passwords field in Windows resources before upgrading to this build. </div>

                            <p>From build 11103, when proxy server configuration was enabled in Password Manager Pro, users using the latest version of Duo TFA experienced a premature authentication time-out. This issue has been fixed.</p>

                                <li>In addition to supporting the JTDS JDBC driver to connect to the SQL server, Password Manager Pro now supports Microsoft JDBC driver, version 8.4.1.</li>
                                <li>We have implemented a patch integrity verification, which will henceforth require importing an SSL certificate (available as a downloadable file) whenever the product is upgraded using the PPM file. It is only a one-time
                                    operation. For the upgrade instructions and PPM download links, click <a href="upgradepack.html">here</a>.</li>

                                <li>Henceforth, if an administrator restricts a user from setting up the encryption passphrase for their personal passwords (under 'General Settings'), the user can set up an 'encryption key' for their personal passwords from
                                    the 'Personal' tab. They are also free to choose between whether to store or not store the encryption key or use Password Manager Pro's encryption key.</li>

                                    have been merged into a single schedule - 'Audit Purge and Digest' Schedule.
                                </li>
                                <li>The system-created scheduled task 'Audit Update Schedule' has been renamed as 'Dashboard Chart Activity Schedule'. It is available under 'Admin &gt;&gt; Manage &gt;&gt; Scheduled Tasks'.</li>
                                <li>Previously, when the 'Purge Audit Records' option was enabled, all the audit records older than the specified number of days were purged. From build 12000 onwards, users can choose to retain or delete audit records based
                                    on the operation type.</li>
                                <li>From now on, MSP admins will be able to replicate audit operation type settings and audit purge settings across all client organizations.</li>
                                <li><strong>New REST APIs</strong><br> This release comes with a bunch of new REST APIs for the following operations: Associate a resource to a resource group, Dissociate a resource from a resource group, Fetch resource groups

                            <p>Two new agents have been introduced in build 11301 - C# agent for Windows/ Windows Domain and Go agent for Linux. Password Manager Pro will henceforth allow users to restrict user accounts that are added via agents (new agents
                                only) during account discovery, using regex patterns.</p>
                            <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Earlier, the agent key validity could be set only up to 24 hours. Now, the agent key validity can be set up to 999 hours via system properties.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, Windows Firewall settings prevented multiple agent discovery in machines. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, while choosing the database, lengthy database connection names were only half visible in the UI. This issue has now been fixed by adding a tooltip with the full database name.</li>
                                <li>From build 11200, users imported via AD were unable to login into Password Manager Pro using local authentication. This issue has been fixed.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Renewal of Certificates</strong><br> A 'Renew' option has been newly added under 'Certificates &gt;&gt; Certificates' that allows users to initiate the renewal of Self Signed, Root Signed, Microsoft CA Signed, and
                                    Agent-signed certificates, and also the certificates issued by the third-party CAs. Upon renewal, the renewed certificates will automatically inherit the deployed servers and their credentials.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Discovery from UNC Shared Path for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports SSL certificate discovery from UNC (Universal Naming Convention) shared paths for Windows, Linux, and
                                    Mac OS machines. Use this feature to discover SSL certificates stored in a folder path within a server that is accessible by Password Manager Pro. After the discovery, Password Manager Pro will consolidate the newly-discovered
                                    SSL certificates in its certificate repository. This option is available during scheduled certificate discovery as well.</li>
                                <li><strong>Certificate Discovery in DMZ Machines using the KMP Agent</strong><br> It is now possible to discover the SSL certificates from directories in remote machines that are not directly accessible by Password Manager
                                    Proâall through the KMP Agent. This option is available during scheduled certificate discovery as well.</li>
                                <li><strong>Browser Deployment of Certificates</strong><br> Users will now be able to deploy SSL certificates in browsers from Password Manager Pro for the following server types: Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li>
                                <li><strong>SSH Key Association using "Elevate to root user" Option</strong><br> This release comes with a new "Elevate to root user" option. Now, as a security measure, it is possible to restrict users from directly accessing
                                    root users by disabling the root user login. Enabling this option elevates a user login from a non-root user to a root user and associates keys to all other users on the server.</li>
                                <li><strong>RestApi</strong><br> The new REST API, 'Deploy Certificate', has been added.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>SSL Certificate Rediscovery</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now allows you to rediscover SSL certificates from the same source using the server details entered during the previous discovery operation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integration with Buypass Go SSL and ZeroSSL</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now integrates with Buypass Go SSL and ZeroSSLâtwo certificate authorities that use the Automatic Certificate Management Environment
                                    (ACME) protocol to provide free, secure SSL certificates. Users can now request, acquire, create, deploy, renew, and automate the end-to-end management of SSL/TLS certificates issued by Buypass Go SSL and ZeroSSL, all
                                    directly from the Password Manager Pro web interface.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integration with ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Plus</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now integrates with ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Plus. This integration uses ManageEngine MDM APIs to
                                    discover and deploy SSL certificates to and from the mobile devices managed by your MDM server. Password Manager Pro then lets you filter the discovered SSL certificates based on the OS type such as iOS, Android, Windows,
                                    Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Apple tvOS. It is also possible to export reports of the MDM certificates managed in the Password Manager Pro repository within a selected period. Additionally, you can schedule periodic generation
                                    of MDM certificate reports.</li>
                                <li>Manager Pro allows you to globally modify the access level of the shared certificates.
                                </li>
                                <li>New REST API's, 'Share SSL Certificate to User', 'Share SSL Certificate to User Group', 'Share SSL Certificate Group to User', 'Share SSL Certificate Group to User Group', 'Revoke SSL Certificate from User', 'Revoke SSL
                                    Certificate from User Group', 'Revoke SSL Certificate Group from User', 'Revoke SSL Certificate Group from User Group', 'Create SSL Certificate Group', 'Delete SSL Certificate Group', 'Edit SSL Certificate Group', 'Generate
                                    an Agent Install Key', have been added.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>When the PMP and KMP agents were installed in the same machine, the data used for the agents' authentication was stored in the same place in the registry, causing the overwriting of the agents' data, thereby making the
                                    agents non-functional. This issue has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>The automated scheduled task introduced for dashboard optimization caused the database connections to become unavailable, for some time, for a few users. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
                                <li>When Two-Factor Authentication was enabled, the legal banner and the privacy policy banner links in the Login page (enabled from the 'Rebrand' wizard) did not show up/work. We have resolved this issue.

                                <li>Earlier, for some users, after configuring Duo TFA, the requests that were supposed to be sent to the PMP access URL were directly sent to the Password Manager Pro server. This issue has been fixed now.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, the 'Edit User' action did not work for certain users. We have resolved this issue.</li>
                                <li>Previously, the password entered in 'Importing users from AD wizard &gt;&gt; specify the user name and password manually' did not get saved due to a password encoding issue. This issue has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, users were able to export offline passwords even when the export password was disabled using the export URL. This issue has been fixed now.</li>

                            <p>There existed a vulnerability from version 9.7.0 that permitted the retrieval of masked non-website resource type passwords as clear-text, by capturing the API call of the Password Manager Pro browser extension and replacing
                                the password ID of website account passwords. This vulnerability occurred under any or all of the following circumstances; with the user type roles only, with the password masking option enabled by the Admin under 'General
                                Settings', and only to the shared passwords. This issue reported by Sandeep Saxena (CVE-2021-31857), has been fixed.</p>

                            <p><strong>Enhancement</strong></p>
                            <p>As an extension to the above fix, a new option has been introduced under 'General Settings &gt;&gt; Password Retrieval', which allows Autologon for URL-configured non-website resources via the browser extension, even if the
                                plain text view of passwords is disabled. With this, users will have the flexibility to enable or disable the Autologon functionality carried on via the browser extension for which the URL is configured.

                                    Obvious Substitution (LEET) word check, Password Strength Meter, Sample Password Generator, New Password Generator, etc. These would be of great help to administrators in setting highly secure password policies.

                            <p><strong>Enhancement</strong></p>
                            <p>It is now possible to 'retry' the periodic password reset of Resource groups by configuring password reset retry settings, which include the number of retries and retry interval. If this setting is enabled, the password reset
                                will be re-attempted after every failure at the specified retry interval within the specified number of attempts.</p>

                            <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Expiry Notifications for SSL Certificates</strong><br> Now, use Password Manager Pro to discover, import, and configure expiry notifications for SSL certificates hosted in the following Amazon Web Services: AWS
                                    Certificate Manager (ACM) and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).</li>
                                <li><strong>Self-signed Certificates Auto Renewal</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports automated renewal of self-signed certificates along with Microsoft CA certificate renewal.</li>
                                <li><strong>SSL Certificate Deployment and Binding - IIS Server</strong><br> From now on, you can both deploy a certificate to the IIS server and also bind it to the desired website in the IIS, all from the Password Manager
                                    Pro interface itself, without the need to access the IIS server separately. Also, an option has been provided to automatically restart the IIS server for the deployment and binding to take effect, thereby eliminating
                                    the need for the manual restart from the IIS end.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Additional Fields</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now brings you the 'Additional Fields' feature, configured from 'Admin &gt;&gt; SSH/SSL Config', and used to include any additional information about SSH keys
                                    and SSL certificates stored in the repository. There are four different categories of Additional Fields: character, numeric, date, and email. Users can choose to add or remove the Additional fields from SSH and SSL
                                    views. While creating an Additional field, users can choose whether it is applicable for SSH/SSL/both, and also customize the emails mentioned in it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Column Chooser</strong><br> This version of Password Manager Pro comes with the 'Column Chooser' feature that allows users to show or hide columns at runtime, and also rearrange the columns from the current view
                                    via drag-and-drop.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Keys</strong><br> PGP encryption is used to enhance cryptographic privacy and authentication for online communication by encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, files, etc. It uses a combination
                                    of data compression, hashing, and public-key cryptography to boost confidentiality. Now, Password Manager Pro brings you this PGP functionality in the form of PGP key generation, where the keys are used to encrypt the
                                    data like emails, texts, etc. Create, store and manage PGP keys under 'Admin &gt;&gt; SSH/SSL'. Modify the key description anytime, export private/public keys, export keys to multiple email ids, and generate, view,
                                    and schedule reports. You can also send expiry notification emails to admins. This feature allows you to share and collaborate information securely among your trusted groups of users and businesses.</li>
                                <li><strong>GlobalSign</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports integration with GlobalSign SSL a trusted Certificate Authority and a leading cloud-based PKI solutions provider. This integration enables users to request,
                                    acquire, import, deploy, renew and automate the end-to-end lifecycle management of SSL/TLS certificates issued by GlobalSign, directly from the Password Manager Pro web interface.</li>
                                <li><strong>Certificate Deployment using Agent</strong><br> Password Manager Pro can already deploy and bind certificates to IIS servers belonging to the domain, where Password Manager Pro also resides. Now, Password Manager
                                    Pro can also deploy certificates to IIS servers in demilitarized zones and also bind them to websites in IIS, all using an agent. This makes Password Manager Pro more scalable, as it can deploy and bind certificates
                                    in IIS servers, irrespective of whether they are in the same or different domain.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>CSR Signing using Agent</strong><br> In addition to the already available two sign types, namely, 'MS Certificate Authority' and 'Sign with Root', used to sign certificates from Password Manager Pro, a third sign
                                    type 'MS Certificate Authority with Agent' has been introduced. This new sign type is mainly used to sign certificates originating from a distinct domain, i.e., other than the domain to which Password Manager Pro belongs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integrating with Ticketing Systems</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now integrates with enterprise ticketing systems namely ServiceDesk Plus (on-premise) and ServiceNow. This integration ensures that automatic
                                    service requests are created in the ticketing environment to notify administrators of SSL certificates that are at the risk of expiring and certificates that are deemed vulnerable after a vulnerability scan in Password
                                    Manager Pro. Users can set notification policies to govern the frequency of service request creation for expiring and vulnerable tickets.</li>
                                <li><strong>New Certificate Format - PEM</strong> A new certificate format, Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), has been added, in addition to the already available certificate export formats, Keystore and PFX, where the PEM format
                                    is used for digital certificates and keys, deployed in web server platforms (e.g., Apache). </li>
                                <li><strong>Support for GoDaddy DNS</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports GoDaddy DNS to complete the domain control validation procedure while acquiring certificates from public Certificate Authorities, along with
                                    the already available DNS support types, Azure DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Amazon route 53, and RFC2136 Update. Using GoDaddy DNS, users can update the DNS record for GoDaddy domain validation from the Password Manager portal
                                    itself.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro now provides additional insights on agent activity such as heartbeat interval, latest response time and operation performed.</li>
                                <li>For scheduled SSL expiry tasks, users now have the option to choose whether or not, to receive email notifications when no certificates in that particular schedule are nearing expiration.</li>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro offers automatic bundling of individual private key (.key) files and certificate files (.cer/.pem) into 'JKS' and 'PKCS' keystore file formats and provides export option for the same.
                                </li>
                                <li>Two extra categories have been added to the criteria-based certificate group creation: AWS service and Certificate template.</li>
                                <li>Now, it is possible to use the Password Manager Pro service account credentials for authentication while deploying certificates in Windows servers.</li>
                                <li>Henceforth, while creating a certificate, users can provide ephemeral access (validity in hours and minutes) to the certificates created, after which the certificate auto-expires. This eliminates the need for compulsory
                                    permanent access credentials to access target systems and also explicit access repeal.
                                </li>
                                <li>It is now possible to perform SNI-based SSL discovery using the Common Name and IP Address combination.
                                </li>
                                <li>The option to filter certificates based on the key length and signature algorithm within specific expiry days has been added to the 'getAllSSLCertificates' Rest API.
                                </li>
                                <li>It is now possible to customize notifications and their intervals. Users can now choose not to receive notifications regarding the expired certificates, and send a separate email and customized subject per certificate,
                                    from 'Admin &gt;&gt; SSH/SSL &gt;&gt; Notification Settings'. The same actions can be done while creating new schedules under 'SSH/SSL &gt;&gt; Schedules &gt;&gt; Add Schedule', where you have to select the Schedule
                                    Type as 'SSL Expiry'.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, Password Manager Pro allowed signing and deployment of certificates only from Windows systems. Now, it is possible to perform certificate signing and deployment to Windows systems from Linux installations through
                                    agents.
                                </li>
                                <li>It is now possible to provide customized subjects in 'Schedules'. Also, users can tailor schedules by adding custom email content and a unique signature.</li>
                                <li>In RestAPI, the fetch details format is modified in such a way that the "details" attribute holds all the data. The following is the modified API list; GetCertificateDetails, getallsslcertificates, getAllSSLCertsExpiryDate,
                                    sslCertSingleDiscovery, sslCertRangeDiscovery, getallsshkeys, GetSSHKey, GetSSHKeysForUser and GetAllAssociatedUsers.</li>
                                <li>This release comes with an exclusive page for 'Windows Agents', accessible from the 'Certifcates' tab, from where users will be able to perform all agent-specific operations such as SSL Discovery using agent, deployment
                                    of SSL certificates in certificate groups using agent and CSR Signing with MSCA agent.
                                </li>
                                <li>Certificate deployment in multiple servers has now been made simpler by using an agent, provided the agent is running in the server to be deployed, and both the agent name and the server DNS name are the same.
                                </li>
                                <li>Now, auto-renewal of certificates is possible for the 'MSCA using agent' sign type as well, from 'Admin &gt;&gt; SSL Certificates &gt;&gt; Certificate Renewal'.</li>
                                <li>The 'Certificate Sign Report' comes with the following MSCA/Third party CA signing details; Certificate Authority, Certificate Template, Sign Type column.</li>
                                <li>The 'Certificate Renewal report' comes with the 'Renewed By' column relevant to MSCA and 3rdPartyCA renewal details.</li>
                                <li>A new option 'Reissue Certificate' has been added under 'Certificates &gt;&gt; GlobalSign' that allows users to request GlobalSign to reissue an SSL certificate.
                                </li>
                                <li>The new 'GlobalSign Orders Report' allows the GlobalSign orders to be added as individual reports, which provide a detailed view of certificate orders requested from the GlobalSign CA.</li>
                                <li>From now on, users can add a "Key Comment' while importing a new SSH key and editing an existing key from the repository. Also, users can avail the checkbox "Update comment in associated users" to update the Key comment
                                    to the associated end servers automatically.</li>
                                <li>Now, it is possible to add additional properties to a certificate while creating it, by using the 'Advanced Options' menu. It allows users to choose from a list of Key Usage and Advanced Key Usage properties, and add them
                                    to the new certificate. Examples for the Key Usage properties include; Digital Signature, Decipher Only, Encipher Only, and Certificate Sign.</li>
                                <li>The DigiCert CA page has been enhanced with a new menu 'Show' that has four options, Expired, Revoked, Rejected, and Others, used to filter the DigiCert CA list view.

                            <ul>
                                <li>No inherited permissions are allowed for data and configurations directories.</li>
                                <li>"<strong>Authenticated Users</strong>" permission has been excluded entirely.</li>
                                <li>Only the CREATOR OWNER, SYSTEM, Installation User, NT AUTHORITY\Network Service and Administrators groups will have the Full Control over the directories and also can start PostgreSQL.</li>

                                <li><strong>Integration with DigiCert SSL</strong><br> Password Manager Pro integrates with DigiCert a leading TLS/SSL, IoT and various other PKI solutions provider. Users can request, acquire, create, deploy, renew and automate
                                    the end-to-end management of SSL/TLS certificates issued by DigiCert, all directly from the Password Manager Pro portal.</li>
                                <li><strong>CSR Templates</strong><br> It is now possible to create and use predefined templates for CSR (Certificate Signing Request) generation.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Option to Exclude Certificates</strong><br> Users can now choose to ignore certain certificates during the SSL discovery or manual addition of certificates into the Password Manager Pro repository. A new option
                                    is added under '<strong>Admin
                                        &gt;&gt; SSH/SSL &gt;&gt; Exclude Certificate</strong>', which you can utilize to add the certificates to be excluded, by specifying their Common Name and Serial Number.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Support for RFC2136 DNS Updates</strong><br> Password Manager Pro now supports RFC2136 DNS updates to complete domain control validation while acquiring certificates from public certificate authorities (CAs). Option
                                    to modify the email id of the Let's Encrypt account, used by Let's Encrypt to send email alerts of expiring certificates.</li>

                                <li>Earlier, it was possible to associate a SSH key with a user account only when the target system was reachable from the Password Manager Pro server. This was troublesome when the target system was inaccessible. Now, from
                                    the Password Manager Pro build 10400, an option is provided for Linux resource types that users can opt to force map SSH keys to user accounts, even if the target systems are not reachable.
                                </li>
                                <li>Users can now use Password Manager Pro to sign CSRs (either using your internal Microsoft CA or a root certificate) as and when they are generated.</li>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro now supports file-based discovery for scheduled SSH and SSL discovery tasks.

                                <li>A new dashboard widget to provide data about SSL configuration vulnerabilities has been added.</li>
                                <li>Support is enabled for the discovery of SSH keys with ECDSA and ED25519 signature algorithms.
                                </li>
                                <li>A new REST API to view the private key passphrase of SSL certificates has been added.

                            <p>The Password Manager Pro (PMP) agent is used to connect with and manage remote resources that are not attached to the PMP server. Earlier, the agent was downloaded from the PMP console and straight away deployed in target systems.
                                Now, from build 10302, each time while installing the agent on a remote server, you will have to provide a unique 'Agent Key', generated and copied from the PMP console while downloading the agent. The keys are for single
                                use only and will be automatically revoked after that. If you wish to install a key in multiple servers, you can keep the key active for the number of hours specified.

                                Plus integration brings about out-of-the-box analytics on resources, user accounts and audits. Analytics Plus sources data from PMP via its API using user login credentials. The reports are generated automatically with
                                up-to-date data, and you can gain a complete overview of the reports from the PMP-specific dashboard of Analytics Plus. You can also set timeline filters.

                            <p><strong>Password Manager Pro Plugins for Chef and Puppet</strong><br> Introducing new plugins for Chef and Puppet CI/CD platform, in addition to Jenkins and Ansible. Both Chef and Puppet use the Master-Slave architecture, where
                                communication happens via an SSL-based secure encrypted channel. Dedicated external app plugins are provided for both the plugins, so that the code pulls the passwords directly from Password Manager Pro during run time,
                                instead of storing them as plain texts within script files. This combats security threats to resources, enhances the security of passwords and eliminates the need for users to modify the code when passwords are changed.
                                The plugins thereby improve the overall security in organizations' DevOps pipeline and also impose consistent rotation and automatic update of the new passwords in the respective remote devices.

                                <li><strong>Bulk Resource/Account/Resource Group Sharing</strong><br> Previously, it was possible to share only a single resource, or an account, or a resource group, with user(s) or user group(s). Now, users with proper permission
                                    can share resources, accounts and resource groups, in bulk, with user(s) or user group(s).

                                        <li>Earlier, it was possible to set only two admins as approvers for password request under Resource Actions &gt;&gt; Configure Access Control &gt;&gt; Miscellaneous Settings. From now on, Admins can set 'n' number
                                            of admins (5 by default and 10 as maximum) as approvers for password request. The default approver count can be altered under General Settings.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Admins can now configure auto-approval for different days with different time configurations (Maximum of 3 different time configurations per day), under Resource Actions &gt;&gt; Configure Access Control &gt;&gt;
                                            Auto Approval. It is possible to configure the same time for every day and also different time configurations for different days.

                                </li>
                                <li>Formerly, when multiple certificates were discovered from a single resource, and when the DNS name of one of the certificates was changed, the DNS names of all the other certificates also got changed. This has now been
                                    fixed.

                                <li>Earlier, when the scheduled discovery operations for SSH and SSL failed, there were a few instances, where the audit records were not updated properly. This has now been fixed.</li>

                                <li><strong>Integration with ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (ADSSP) </strong> <br> Earlier, when the ADSSP's privileged domain account password was reset in PMP, the new password had to be manually updated in ADSSP. If not,
                                    ADSSP still retains the old password, thereby restricting the AD users from performing tasks such as password reset, account unlock, etc. With PMP-ADSSP integration, the privileged domain account details of ADSSP will
                                    be mapped with the domain account details in PMP. So, whenever the password reset of ADSSP's privileged domain account is performed in PMP, the new password will be automatically updated in ADSSP as well.</li><br>

                                <li><strong>Integration with ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus (SDP)</strong><br> Technicians using SDP often need to access target machines (or resources) manually to resolve issues, which involves security-related challenges,
                                    such as sharing sensitive passwords for authentication, etc., especially while using the privileged accounts. They also had the pain of jumping between machines to perform different tasks. With this integration, accessing
                                    the remote systems from the ServiceDesk Plus portal is just a click away for the Technicians. Administrators can now provide the advantage of secure remote access to the target machines (or resources) only to the authorized
                                    Technicians, without sharing the credentials. The Technicians can remotely access the target endpoints (or resources) from the ServiceDesk Plus portal without having to log in to PMP each time to fetch the credentials.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>In PMP build 10101, when a custom resource type was created (under Admin &gt;&gt; Resources &gt;&gt; Resource Types &gt;&gt; Add) using the "Existing Resource Type" category and applied to the resources, the password reset
                                    failed for the Domain accounts in the resource. This issue is fixed now.</li>
                                <li>While handling a security fix in build 10102, the URL of PMP Agent was mistakenly blocked along with a few other URLs. This interrupted the communication between the Agent and the PMP server, which in turn suspended the
                                    Agent-related activities in PMP. This issue is fixed now.</li>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro provides the option to configure remote password reset through a landing server for Cisco devices such as Cisco Catalyst, Cisco IOS, and Cisco CAT OS. From PMP build 10001 onwards, when an existing
                                    landing server was selected to perform the remote password reset for a resource, the settings though appeared to be saved did not get saved actually. This issue is fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>In addition to using account credentials to launch a remote SSH connection, Password Manager Pro also allows the remote connections to be tunnelled through private keys. From PMP build 10001 onwards, when the private key
                                    option is enabled or disabled for a Linux-based resource type (Linux, Cisco IOS, Cisco CatOS, Cisco PIX, Juniper NetScreen OS, HP Procurve and VMware ESXi), the auto-logon helper option for that resource got disabled,
                                    thereby entirely removing the option to launch a remote connection. This issue is fixed.

                                <li>PMP - MSP Edition is designed to create a Resource group named "Default Group" when an MSP Admin is assigned to manage any client ORG. In our earlier versions, if an MSP Admin is removed from managing a client ORG and then
                                    re-added, another "Default Group" was created under their ownership, causing duplication. This issue has now been addressed. When an MSP admin is removed and readded to manage a Client ORG, PMP will match the existing
                                    "Default Group" of this admin and continue to retain the same without creating a duplicate group.</li>

                            <p>It's been long since we started using "C:/ManageEngine" as the default installation directory. But, this gave rise to the vulnerability that any locally authenticated user was able to view/add/delete/modify files under "C:/ManageEngine".
                                Hence, as a security practice, we have switched to "C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\PMP" as the default installation directory. We recommend all our customers to have their installations under "C:\Program Files\ManageEngine\PMP"
                                only. Instead, if you wish to install Password Manager Pro under any other folder, please go through our <a href="https://download.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/password-management-best-practices.pdf" target="_blank">best practices guide</a>                                for the necessary precautions to be taken.

                                    <strong>Integration with public Certificate Authorities (CAs)</strong><br> Password Manager Pro facilitates end-to-end life cycle management of certificates obtained from trusted certificate authorities (CAs), enabling
                                    users to request, consolidate, deploy, renew and track certificates issued by multiple commercial CAs, all from a single interface. This functionality, powered through a seamless API integration with The SSL Store one
                                    of the largest platinum partners of world's leading CAs, provides the users with the option to acquire the certificates from the following third-party CAs and manage them directly from Password Manager Pro's web interface:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro supports Active Directory-based Single-Sign-On that works via NTLMv2. While this was working fine in older versions, the NLTMv2 authentication against the Computer Object was failing in version 10.0.
                                    This issue is now addressed and the AD SSO feature works fine now. </li>
                                <li>In Password Manager Pro version 10.0, the "Advanced Search" field did not return the intended results for the keyword entered using the AND/OR-based search criteria. This issue is fixed and the "Advanced Search" is fully
                                    functional now.</li>
                                <li>From Password Manager Pro version 9.7, when a user was deleted from AD / LDAP / Azure, instead of a single notification email, there was a continuous triggering of emails from Password Manager Pro, during every sync. This
                                    issue is fixed. </li>
                                <li>From Password Manager Pro version 9.8, in specific cases, while viewing the resources under a Dynamic Group, other resources out of the group (belonging to the logged-in user) were also displayed along with the resources
                                    belonging to the selected group. This issue is fixed.</li>

                                <li>From Password Manager Pro version 9.9, when the local authentication for AD users was disabled (under "Admin &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; User Management"), the local authentication got disabled
                                    for "all users". This restricted the users from accessing Password Manager Pro using their local admin credentials and an 'Incorrect Username/Password' error was thrown. This issue is fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>In Password Manager Pro version 10.0, the "Download" button did not work while transferring a file from a remote machine to a local machine via RDP connection. This issue is fixed.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Linux Resource Discovery using SSH</strong><br> Earlier, Password Manager Pro supported Telnet-based discovery alone for Linux endpoints. Now it supports SSH protocol as well for resource discovery. By providing
                                    SSH login credentials, the Admins will be able to discover the Linux endpoints using an IP Address / IP Range.<br>
                                    <strong>Note</strong>: Telnet-based discovery will eventually be deprecated as it is not a secured protocol.
                                </li><br>
                                <li><strong>"Let's Encrypt" Wildcard SSL Certificate Management Support</strong><br> Password Manager Pro already supports SSL certificates signing by "Let's Encrypt" Certificate Authority. Recently, they have upgraded their
                                    protocols to enable support for wild card certificate signing as well. Hence, from now on, the PMP users will be able to get their wildcard SSL certificates signed by "Let's Encrypt" CA and manage the same.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>SSL Certificate Discovery from SMTP servers</strong><br> Password Manager Pro already allows discovery of SSL certificates from Certificate Stores, Microsoft CA and Active Directory. In addition to this, the SSL
                                    certificates can now be discovered from SMTP servers as well.
                                </li><br>
                                <li><strong>SSL Certificate Discovery as a Scheduled Operation</strong><br> Earlier, importing of SSL certificates from the Microsoft Certificate Store was an on-demand operation. Now, it is possible for Admins to create scheduled
                                    tasks (under Admin &gt;&gt; SSH/SSL &gt;&gt; Schedule &gt;&gt; Add Schedule) to automatically discover and import the certificates from Microsoft Certificate Store and certificates issued by Microsoft Certificate Authority.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Import Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)</strong><br> Though it was earlier possible to import a key or a certificate inside Password Manager Pro, the Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) had to be generated inside
                                    the application only. Now, PMP allows importing (under "Certificates &gt;&gt; Create CSR &gt;&gt; Import") and managing of CSR files, generated externally, by forwarding them to trusted certificate authorities and tracking
                                    their status.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Crumbling of SSH Session Recordings</strong><br> Formerly, the SSH session recordings were stored as encoded, individual files. This might cause performance issues when the SSH session time is stretched, as the
                                    file gets constantly updated in real-time. From now on, the recordings out of extended SSH sessions will be stored as multiple files and rolled over. This should provide a smooth SSH session experience and also a zero
                                    buffer time during the session playback.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Remote Password Reset for Weblogic Server</strong><br> Apart from the endpoints listed <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/help/remote_password_reset.html" title="Remote Password Reset"
                                        target="_blank">here</a>, Password Manager Pro can now reset, verify and manage the passwords of Weblogic application servers as well. It is possible to manage the passwords of all the Weblogic server versions, as the
                                    password reset is performed with the help of JMX service.
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>RDP Gateway Enhancements</strong><br> Password Manager Pro employs "SparkGateway" from Remote Spark for establishing RDP Gateway sessions. The bundled version of SparkGateway, updated in this version, comes with
                                    enhanced file transfer functionalities. This allows users to leverage file transfer improvements while opening RDP connections using PMP.</li><br>

                                        vault</strong><br> Heretofore, when an SSH key was deleted from the Password Manager Pro vault, the same was removed from the associated Unix/Linux endpoints as well. From this version, Admins have the option (in
                                    the SSH key delete confirmation window) to choose whether to remove a key from the endpoint, while deleting it from inside the vault.</li>

                            <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While using Internet Explorer, the RDP sessions had intermittent freezing issues and lag, especially when the sessions were idle for 10-15 mins.</li>
                                <li>Due to an encoding issue, the SSH sessions did not work, when the users whose AD username begins with the character 'u' logged into the Password Manager Pro.</li>
                                <li>When the option "Generate unique password for every account(Recommended)" was selected under "Groups &gt;&gt; Actions &gt;&gt; Periodic Password Reset", new passwords generated were based on the resource group password
                                    policy, instead of account password policy. This has been fixed now.</li>
                                <li>From version 9000, the "User Authentication Failed" report under "Dashboard &gt;&gt; User Dashboard &gt;&gt; User Activity" displayed 'No audits found' message due to a filter issue. This has been fixed now to show the
                                    valid data.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, a new web app connection always replaces an existing connection (when launched through the "Connections" tab). This is fixed now, and each connection launches in new tabs.</li>
                                <li>Password Manager Pro uses SCP protocol for deploying SSH keys in target end-points. Previously, only the "To" file information was sent along the SCP request which worked fine. But in the recent SCP versions, the "From"
                                    file information has also been made mandatory. So now, Password Manager Pro sends both "To" and "From" information of the SSH key files, thus ensuring proper completion of file deployment.</li>
                                <li>In earlier versions of Password Manager Pro, while deploying SSL certificates in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server, the private keys exported along with the certificates were corrupted. This is fixed
                                    now.
                                </li>
                                <li>Previously, while signing a certificate using custom Root CA, a security error was thrown when the "SAN" field was blank. This is now fixed, and the certificates can be signed, even when the SAN field is left empty.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Security Fix</strong></p>
                            <p>We have renovated the security framework of Password Manager Pro. The following are some of the major changes and enhancements:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In earlier versions, Password Manager Pro primarily relied on "Blacklisting" for securing the product URLs from Injection and other script attacks. With this release, the security framework has been updated to use "Whitelisting"
                                    of the necessary URLs, which maximizes product security.</li>
                                <li>The validation of JSON array parameters has been intensified for optimal security.
                                </li>
                                <li>A few checks with respect to file uploads (e.g., limit and size) are included to keep load attacks at bay.
                                </li>

                            <p>This release introduces DevOps support in Password Manager Pro with new plugins for Jenkins and Ansible pipelines. Additionally, provisions to perform password resets for SSH-based resources through custom command inputs have
                                also been added amid other new features and enhancements.</p>
                            <p><strong>New Features &amp; Enhancements</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Plugins for DevOps Containers - Jenkins and Ansible</strong><br> The Password Manager Pro plugins developed for credential management in Jenkins and Ansible help improve security in organizations' DevOps pipeline.
                                    The plugins ensure that required credentials are retrieved securely from Password Manager Pro's vault every time when an automation schedule is run through the tools, instead of being embedded in plain text within script
                                    files. Moreover, with the credentials stored in Password Manager Pro, you can also enforce regular rotation and automatic update of the new password in the respective remote device.<br><br>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Build Password Reset Workflows with SSH Commands</strong><br> Now extend Password Manager Pro's reset provisions to support remote password changes for SSH-based resources in your environment without the need for
                                    a CLI terminal. Quickly build command workflows using built-in or customized SSH sets and map them to respective SSH device accounts to execute password resets in a simple and effective manner. This new addition to
                                    Password Manager Pro's reset capabilities enables you to enforce automatic password updates for resource types that are not supported out-of-the-box by the application.

                                <li>From v9200 till v9803, passwords checked out under a time-sensitive access request did not get checked back in automatically upon access expiration if a Password Manager Pro server restart took place in between. This has
                                    been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9802 till v9803, users could not raise password access requests when they and the environment in which Password Manager Pro server was installed were in different time zones. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>[MSP Edition] From v9802 till v9803, while configuring access control for a resource in a particular client organization, the user groups list in the configuration window also displayed the user groups that belonged to
                                    other client organizations. This has been fixed.</li>

                                <li>Earlier, while configuring remote password reset and auto logon actions for Windows, Windows Domain, and Linux resources, administrators could view the accounts of resources that they had no access to. However, only the
                                    account names were visible in this case and there was no password exposure involved. This was applicable for bulk configurations as well. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9700, the PDF file for user activity, user access and password inventory reports that were scheduled had file corruption error when delivered as an email attachment. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9700, during service startup, a server-side action resulted in Password Manage Pro's system properties getting printed in the log files. The keystore password of the certificate that was used for HTTPS connections
                                    from the web server was also printed in plain text in the captured logs. This has been fixed.

                            <p>This release strengthens SSL certificate management in Password Manager Pro by introducing GoDaddy integration and certificate sharing. Other enhancements include support for Traditional Chinese in multi-language editions as
                                well as the provision to auto logon to Cisco resources using Windows domain accounts.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>New Features &amp; Enhancements</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GoDaddy integration for SSL certificate lifecycle management</strong>: Password Manager Pro now supports management of SSL certificates issued by GoDaddy certificate authority. This enhancement, powered through
                                    a seamless integration with GoDaddy's API, allows administrators request, consolidate, deploy, renew, revoke and manage life cycles of certificates issued by GoDaddy certificate authority from a single interface.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>SSL certificate sharing among users</strong>: Password Manager Pro now allows sharing of SSL certificates or certificate groups with users and user groups. This will enable administrators to share required SSL certificates
                                    with technicians and allow them to track the validity and expiration dates for their server certificates. The feature further allows the technicians to also raise a request with the administrator to provision access
                                    to the private key of the shared certificate whenever required.</li>
                                <li><strong>Localization Support for Traditional Chinese</strong>: Introducing localization support for Traditional Chinese in Password Manager Pro's multi-language editions, besides Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French,
                                    Turkish, and Polish languages.</li>
                                <li><strong>RESTful API:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>New REST API to add dynamic resource groups.</li>
                                        <li>REST API to create resources enhanced with the option to enable key-based authentication for Linux resources.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9802 onwards, Password Manager Pro's auto logon feature will list the Windows domain accounts that the user has access to, besides the local user accounts in Cisco resources. If the Cisco resource is already set up
                                    to accept Windows domain account credentials for authentication, users can launch SSH sessions to that resource using the domain accounts as well.</li>
                                <li>From v9802 onwards, XLS exports of password inventory reports (both canned and custom) will include a new column that displays resource owner information.</li>
                                <li>A new option has been added under Admin &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; User Management to restrict users from adding privileged accounts to Password Manager Pro via browser extensions.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when two-factor authentication (TFA) was enabled, the login screen of Password Manager Pro's mobile applications and browser extensions asked for the username first and the primary password and TFA credential were
                                    then requested together in a fresh second screen. Henceforth, the user has to input the username and password (first-factor) in the login screen and then the TFA credentials in a new screen upon successful primary authentication.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>From v8604, when an administrator edited resources in bulk from the Resources or Groups tab and saved the changes, the action also reset the password reset configurations to default for the selected resources. This has
                                    been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9702, while copy-pasting values stored as custom text fields (non-password) in the Personal tab, special characters were converted to their hexadecimal values during the action due to decoding issues. This has been
                                    fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9600, API user accounts with 'Full Access' permission over a resource were unable to add a new account under that resource using 'Create Resource' REST API. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>[IE browser only] From v9400, users were unable to view an account's password in clear text from that account's 'Passcard' link as well as in the 'Account Details' window. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, the symbol 'exclamation mark' ( ! ) was not included in the set of special characters available for password policies. Due to this, associating resources/accounts with a password policy that enforced the usage
                                    of only the symbol 'exclamation mark' ( ! ) under special characters resulted in passwords being set as 'unknown' during auto-generation. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, if the Password Manager Pro administrator had disabled the local authentication option for all users, users could still bypass the restriction provided that they used a valid local account username and password.
                                    This has been fixed.</li>

                                <li>From build 9700, Password Manager Pro moved to Apache Tomcat v8.5.27 which required the URLs to be encoded in all the incoming requests, but, the Password Manager Pro agent kept sending plain URLs. When the URLs had special
                                    characters such as backslash ('\'), the requests kept dropping continually, causing the agent to repeat the process again and again. The same process occurred for thousands of agents and ended up in a DOS attack on
                                    the Password Manager Pro server, thereby resulting in a busy CPU. This issue is now fixed by encoding the URLs used by the agent in all its requests. <span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bolder;"><strong>Hence, it is mandatory to
                                            re-deploy the agents
                                            while upgrading to any build after 9800.</strong><br>

                                <li>From v9700, when the Password Manager Pro server starts and is not able to access the encryption key, it resulted in the passwords of the built-in 'admin' and 'guest' accounts being reset to their default values. This condition
                                    existed only for installations running with PostgreSQL as the back-end database and is now fixed. It is always recommended to remove both these built-in accounts in production installations of Password Manager Pro.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Data encryption and protection with SafeNet HSM</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro (PMP) now provides out-of-the-box support for SafeNet Luna PCIe HSM which gives administrators the option to enable hardware-based data encryption for the application. This update helps administrators ensure increased data security
                                    levels by leveraging the integration to securely store PMP's encryption key in the SafeNet HSM appliance available in their environment.

                                            unsupported resource types</strong></p>
                                    Password Manager Pro (PMP) now allows manual addition of custom reset plugins (created in the form of an implementation class) that can be invoked from PMP server to carry out remote password resets for platforms that are not supported out-of-the-box,
                                    such as legacy resource types, in-house applications, etc. Administrators can leverage this update to also configure access control for unsupported resources and enforce automatic reset of their passwords instantly
                                    upon usage.

                                    <p><strong>Integration support for YubiKey two-factor authentication</strong></p>
                                    From v9800 onwards, Password Manager Pro readily integrates with YubiKey a physical key made by Yubico, which ensures secure and strong user authentication, to provide two-factor authentication support for application login.

                                    Password Manager Pro now enables administrators to sign and issue SSL certificates to end-servers within the network environment, based on a root certificate that is trusted within the network.

                                    The REST API to create a new resource now additionally supports inclusion of "Domain Name" for the resource being created. Also, the REST API to get a user's ID now supports special characters in the passed username.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Henceforth, REST API calls to the PMP server will have a threshold policy. When a specific 'API' call reaches the threshold number of 150 calls/IP address within a span of one minute, that API will be locked for a minute. However, this policy is not applicable
                                    to the 'GET' calls.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Users imported from Active Directory (AD) to Password Manager Pro will hereafter be provided the option to launch an RDP connection to Windows resources using their AD credentials even during cases when other authentication methods (such as SAML SSO,
                                    local authentication) are used by the user in addition to AD authentication.
                                </li>

                                    Password Manager Pro now expedites domain validation for Let's Encrypt certificate renewal through automated verification of DNS-01 challenges (for Azure and Cloudflare DNS).
                                </li>

                                    Audit logs for bulk password resets triggered at resource group level and modification of dynamic resource groups have been revised to include more information. The bulk password reset log now also captures the name of the resource group for which the
                                    reset action has been triggered, either on-demand or scheduled. The second log now thoroughly captures the criteria value changes carried out for the selected dynamic resource group.

                            <ul>
                                <li>From v9600 till v9702, both on-demand and scheduled remote password resets for Oracle resources failed due to server-side issues. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9700 till v9701, when the MSP administrator imported an organization from a CSV file that also included information for Account Manager, the detail was not added to PMP during the import. As a result, operations like
                                    manage organization, edit, and delete organizations could not be performed for the imported organization. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9500 till v9702, if the user conducted a custom search in the Resource Audit section, cleared the results, and then tried to carry out a PDF export of all the audit logs in that section, the action did not work and
                                    instead a new tab with a blank white screen opened. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9600 till v9702, the search options in both User and Resource trash did not work. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, if a user had checked out the password of an access controlled resource for a specified duration and the PMP server is restarted within that duration, the condition was automatically revoked and the user was able
                                    to continue using the password beyond the given time. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when an administrator created a new API user and saved the details in Password Manager Pro, the saved host name was automatically changed to that user's IP address which led to connection issues during API calls.
                                    This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, Linux resources added to PMP via REST API were not displayed in the list of available resources for "Public Key Association" in the SSH Keys tab. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, while trying to fetch the IDs of a resource and its account via REST API by providing the resource and account names, resource names containing special characters were not allowed. This has been fixed.

                                <li>Earlier, a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in Password Manager Pro's landing server configuration tab allowed the administrator to upload any file to any location in PMP server via the image file upload field.
                                    This has now been restricted to only image files, which can be saved only in the predestined location.

                                    restart. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In v9700, if AD user import was configured via LDAP integration with synchronization enabled, the Password Manager Pro accounts of a specific set of users in that AD domain were accidentally locked by the application when

                            <p>This release introduces strong controls in Password Manager Pro for protecting personal data stored and processed in the product, in compliance with privacy regulations.</p>
                            <p><strong>New Features &amp; Enhancements</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Additional protection in web GUI while displaying personal data</strong></p>
                            <p>Form fields that contain personal data such as Username, DNS Name, Email ID, Server Name and more will henceforth be masked at all times to enhance protection. Additionally, when a specific user unmasks and views any of the

                            <p><strong>Canned report to demonstrate GDPR compliance stature</strong></p>
                            <p>Password Manager Pro now comes with a canned report that tells you the stature of your compliance with specific requirements listed in Chapter 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in terms of how users' personal
                                data is handled within the product. This report, apart from providing a holistic view of how personal data is handled, will also prove useful while preparing for privacy audits.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Provision to authorize selective administrators with privacy administration
                                    privileges</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>From v9700 onwards, a new "Authorized Administrators" option will appear under Admin &gt;&gt; Settings. This option can be used to authorize only the desired administrators with the privilege to view, access, and modify the
                                following Password Manager Pro settings:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Privacy Settings</li>

                            <p>
                                <span><strong>Note:</strong></span>
                                <br> When you upgrade to v9700 from earlier versions, users with the following roles will be automatically assigned as authorized administrators:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Custom role with permission to access and modify "PMP Server Settings" under PMP Settings category.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Password protected exports</strong></p>
                            <p>Administrators can now include an additional layer of password protection for export operations across Password Manager Pro. This applies to,</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Resource and resource group exports (XLS file)</li>
                                <li>Audit exports (PDF and CSV files)</li>
                                <li>Report exports (XLS and PDF files)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The authorized administrator can either set a global passphrase which will be uniformly used for the aforementioned export operations or allow the users to define their own passphrase for their exported files.
                            </p>

                            <p>Henceforth, when the Password Manager Pro administrator sets up integration with the services mentioned below, the administrator will be required to acknowledge the data transfer from Password Manager Pro server for each respective
                                integration.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Support for Encryption at Rest (EAR) while using MS SQL server as the backend
                                    database</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>For Password Manager Pro installations that function with a MS SQL server as the backend database, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is supported henceforth to achieve EAR. TDE encrypts all the data and log files stored in
                                the SQL server and the key used to encrypt the database is also secured further with a certificate to enhance protection.</p>
                            <p><strong>Backup file encryption</strong></p>
                            <p>Database backup (.zip) files in Password Manager Pro-both on-demand and scheduled, will hereafter be encrypted with the Password Manager Pro master encryption key and stored in the destination directory securely. In case of
                                Password Manager Pro installation running a remote MS SQL server database, the backup file will be encrypted only if the specified backup destination is within the server in which Password Manager Pro is installed and not
                                the remote machine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Privacy controls for canned reports</strong></p>
                            <p>Password Manager Pro now allows authorized administrators to configure privacy settings for canned reports. Administrators can choose from an exhaustive list of personal data, deciding whether each input in the list should
                                be completely omitted from the reports or included as masked information.</p>
                            <p><strong>IP restrictions</strong></p>
                            <p>IP-based restrictions are now supported to limit inbound connections and minimize unwanted traffic to Password Manager Pro server. Restrictions can be configured for web access, API calls, communication from native mobile applications,
                                browser extensions, and Password Manager Pro agents deployed on target machines. The IP restrictions can be set at various levels and combinations, such as defined IP ranges or individual IP addresses. The authorized administrator
                                can either whitelist or blacklist the set of desired IP addresses.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Trash can for delete operations</strong></p>
                            <p>Users and resources in Password Manager Pro can now also be moved to trash alternatively instead of permanent deletion, along with the option to restore from trash when needed. The trashed users and resources will be retained
                                by Password Manager Pro only until the next rotation schedule is carried out for the master encryption key.</p>
                            <p><strong>Purging selective session recordings</strong></p>
                            <p>Earlier, session recordings and chat logs could only be purged in bulk by configuring to delete recordings that are older than a specified number of days. From v9700 onwards, session recordings can also be individually selected
                                under Audit &gt;&gt; Recorded Sessions and purged. Additionally, chat logs for a specific session recording can also be deleted while retaining the recording itself and vice versa.</p>
                            <p><strong>Managing unidentified email addresses in Password Manager Pro</strong></p>
                            <p>A new provision has been added to enable administrators to track and remove unidentified email addresses in Password Manager Pro which do not belong to any of the users in the application. This provision currently allows management
                                of unidentified email addresses which are captured in "User Sessions" audit as well as those that are configured as notification email recipients for scheduled tasks' completion statuses and license expiry alerts.</p>
                            <p><strong>Emergency Measures</strong></p>
                            <p>In the rare scenario that a suspicious activity is sensed within Password Manager Pro but has not yet been identified, a set of recommended best practices that can be carried out have been added under Admin &gt;&gt; Manage
                                &gt;&gt; Emergency Measures. The illustrative list of incident response actions give the administrator a head start on stopping all inward and outward communication to and from Password Manager Pro server respectively,
                                such as stopping API calls, blocking agent communication, and stopping the SSHD server.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Under rebranding, Password Manager Pro now provides an additional option to configure and display a customizable privacy policy banner in the login page.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, the "Total Passwords" count displayed in the dashboard did not include resources of the type File Store, Key Store, and License Store. From v9700 onwards, the count will include the aforementioned resources as
                                    well.
                                </li>
                                <li>While setting up user import from LDAP directories, Password Manager Pro administrators now have the choice to also define the corresponding attribute labels for department and location as used in the LDAP directories.
                                </li>
                                <li>A new option has been added to Password Manager Pro MSP version under Admin &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; User Management, which can be used to display the organization names of the client orgs in the organization
                                    drop down list (at the top right corner) instead of the orgs' display names.</li>
                                <li>The option to delete client organizations has been added to Password Manager Pro MSP version. When a client organization is deleted, all the resources and users added under it will also be deleted.</li>

                                <!--li>In v9601, SSH connections to remote systems failed if Password Manager Pro was running on an Ubuntu server. This has been fixed.</li-->
                                <li>In v9600 and v9601, due to an issue in Windows resource discovery, when the administrator tried to import OU A, OU B was wrongly imported. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9601, the password expiry date for accounts in the Passwords section was wrongly displayed in the quick info beside each account. For instance, if the expiry date for account's password was May 25, it was
                                    shown as June 25 even though it did not affect the password from expiring on May 25. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9601, the owner of a criteria resource group was sometimes unable to view the password of an account associated with a member resource in that resource group. This happened when the specific resource is
                                    owned by another user who's a member of a user group with which the criteria resource group has been shared and the former owner is not a member of that user group. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v8700 till v9601, if the administrator had disabled the default roles, Password Administrator and Password User using Role Filter in their instance, the disabled roles were automatically enabled when their Password
                                    Manager Pro server was restarted.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, user import from Active Directory groups did not work if Password Manager Pro secondary server was up instead of primary server. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when an additional password field was added and used as an account attribute, the option to copy the password to clipboard for that additional field was not available in the resource and account details windows
                                    as well as in the Passcard screen. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, "Change Password" option was shown in the My Profile drop down menu for AD, Azure AD, and LDAP users even though it was not applicable to them. The option has now been removed.</li>

                            <p>Version 9600 introduces a revamp to the 'Synchronization Schedules' screen under Active Directory (AD) configuration. The screen now includes a sidebar navigation tab that lists the AD domains that have synchronization schedules
                                configured and also offers a separate view of synchronization schedules configured for users and resources respectively. The enhancements include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provision to schedule separate synchronization intervals for import of users and resources respectively, for any given domain.</li>
                                <li>Provision to schedule separate synchronization intervals for multiple groups in a domain, for import of users and resources.</li>
                                <li>Provision to schedule separate synchronization intervals for multiple organizational units (OUs) in a domain, for import of users and resources.</li>
                                <li>Provision to set a custom display name for groups/OUs imported from AD domains. The original AD names of the groups/OUs will also be retained.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Microsoft CA Certificate Signing</strong></p>
                            <p>Password Manager Pro now allows users to get certificate requests signed from Microsoft Certificate Authority, thereby facilitating complete life cycle management for certificates issued by Microsoft Certificate Authority.</p>
                            <p><strong>CMDB Integration for SSL Certificates Synchronization</strong></p>
                            <p>Administrators can now sync SSL certificates stored in Password Manager Pro's repository with ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus CMDB and map certificates to specific servers / applications in the CMDB. This allows them to monitor
                                their usage and expiration from ServiceDesk Plus' CMDB.</p>
                            <p><strong>SSL Certificate Groups</strong></p>
                            <p>This enhancement allows users to organize SSL certificates into logical groups based on various criteria and execute actions in bulk for the groups.</p>
                            <p><strong>Localization Support for Turkish</strong></p>
                            <p>Introducing localization support for Turkish in Password Manager Pro's multi-language editions, in addition to Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, and Polish languages.

                            <p><strong>Disable Password Resets for Privileged Accounts</strong></p>
                            <p>This enhancement to account creation and edit actions under Resources tab allows administrators to disable both local and remote password resets for all or a specific set of accounts associated with a resource.

                                <li>Administrators can now set a non-administrative role-either system-owned or custom made, as the default user role in their Password Manager Pro installation. The default role will also be assigned automatically to users
                                    imported from CSV files/AD/Azure AD/LDAP, unless manually specified otherwise by the administrator.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, when the Password Manager Pro server (PMP) had a firewall or load balancing configuration, the PMP audit trails showed the IP address of the firewall/load balancer instead of the IP address of the user's machine.
                                    From v9600 onwards, PMP will log the IP address of the machine, from which it was accessed, in the audit trails instead of the firewall/load balancer IP address.</li>
                                <li>For Password Manager Pro's MSP editions, the audit trails under Resource, User, and Task Audit tabs now also display the name of the respective MSP or client organization associated with the related operation.

                                <li>From v9200 till v9502, when a resource had access controls enabled and multiple users later requested access to that resource with different timeframes for password checkout, the timeframe of the last logged request alone
                                    was recognized and every user could get access to that resource only during that timeframe. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9200 till v9502, when a resource has access controls enabled for a particular user group, the access controls did not apply to any new user(s) added to that user group later. Similarly, the access controls still applied
                                    to a user even after they had been removed from that user group. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9502, when users who were either Password Users or Password Auditors launched an SSH or a SQL session, the option to initiate a chat with the administrator monitoring the session was not displayed in the
                                    session terminal window for the aforementioned users. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v8700 till v9502, under custom roles, the permission to add resources to a resource group in Password Manager Pro was attached to the operation 'Add Resource Group'. This has been changed; the permission is now attached
                                    to the operation 'Edit Resource Group.'</li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9502, under any sections of the Audit tab such as Resource Audit, User Audit etc., when the user runs a filter or keyword search for a specific set of audit trails and later tries to export the obtained
                                    results alone, the exported PDF or CSV file instead contained all the audit trails. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9502, if the users were enforced to provide a reason for password retrieval under General Settings, the users could submit a blank space in the reason field and still retrieve the password. This has been
                                    fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, remote password reset did not work for Oracle user accounts if the respective accounts' names began with a number or a special character. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, if a resource's DNS name contained more than a hundred characters, the corresponding Resource Actions icon did not work under the Resources tab. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when users tried to manually change the password for an existing account of any resource, they were able to set a password that did not comply with the password policy defined for that resource if password visibility
                                    is set to 'Show' under 'Show/hide Password'. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when generating certificate signing requests with SAN names, the SAN names were not updated. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, there were issues with fetching the system locale on Microsoft CA discovery. This has been fixed.

                                <li>Password Manager Pro's master encryption key generation process, which was identified as being weak and vulnerable due to relatively less entropy, has now been made stronger with the inclusion of a higher entropy rate.
                                    This addresses and fixes the said vulnerability-the ability to roughly identify the character pattern used to generate the master encryption key (provided that one has direct physical access to the server in which PMP

                                    for 'Domain Name' fields. This has been fixed.</li>

                                <li>Earlier, while trying to add a new value or edit the existing value of a resource-level additional field via RESTful API, the action also reset the values of other additional fields of that resource and the fields became
                                    empty. This has been fixed now.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, in the MSP edition, while revoking a client org's 'Manage Permission' for a set of admins, the action could not be completed if the number of selected admins exceeded 25. This has been fixed.</li>

                                <li>Password Manager Pro now uses captcha services during application login to enhance security. The users will be required to resolve a captcha when they enter an invalid username/password for five continuous login attempts.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, out of the remote sessions (RDP, SSH, and SQL) launched via Password Manager Pro's session gateway, one or more of the sessions at random still continued to show under the 'Active Privileged Sessions' tab even
                                    when those sessions had already been terminated by respective users. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, the results for 'Find Out of Sync Passwords' action executed for a resource group showed that all passwords were in sync even when passwords for one or all of the Windows resources in that group were not in sync.
                                    The wrong results were captured in the audit records as well. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, when a user clicked on the 'Forgot Password?' link in the Password Manager Pro (PMP) login screen to set a new password via email, the email could not be validated if the recipient's email address contained an
                                    apostrophe. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v8600 till v9200, in Azure AD user/user groups import, only a maximum of 100 users/user groups could be imported. This has been fixed to allow users/user groups import without any count limitation.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v8700 till v9200, users faced blank page issues when the custom role assigned to them did not allow specific actions in that page. For instance, under dashboard provisions, if a user is allowed to access only the user
                                    dashboard and not the password dashboard, clicking on the 'Dashboard' button in the left navigation pane displayed a blank white screen upon loading. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9200, under 'Resources' tab, the users faced specific search and page navigation issues after they had accessed a resource group displayed in the 'Password Explorer' tree view. The following bugs have been
                                    fixed:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>In case of search, when a user used the in-line search option available for 'All My Passwords' (or any other tab under 'Resources'), then navigated to a resource group via the tree view and returned back to 'All
                                            My Passwords' page, the typed-in search term and the respective results were still retained and displayed.</li>
                                        <li>When a user navigated between pages under tabs such as 'Passwords' or 'Favorites', then clicked on a resource group via the tree view and returned back to the tab accessed earlier, the page number (2 or above) that
                                            had been selected previously was launched instead of the first page.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9200, the global search option in the top pane did not work properly when the search term contained the ampersand sign ( '&amp;' ). For instance, if the search term was 'AT&amp;T', search results were returned
                                    only for 'AT', i.e. only for the characters before the sign. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9200, when the account name of a resource contained more than 140 characters, the corresponding Account Actions and Resource Actions icons did not work for that account. This has been fixed.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9200, when the URL length of a resource was more than 700 characters, the corresponding Resource Actions icon did not work. This has been fixed.

                                        <li>Earlier, some users can be excluded from access control. Now, you have an option to exclude both users and user groups from access control.</li>

                                        <li>Auto check-in time can be specified when the request is approved by the administrator.

                                    was launched. In addition, start and stop audit for RDP remote session has been enhanced now.

                                <li>Earlier, addon failed to auto-fill passwords to the websites in client org. This has been fixed now.
                                </li>

                                <li>SparkGateway that comes bundled with Password Manager Pro has been upgraded from v4.6 to v5.0. With this update, RDP sessions can now be launched over TLS 1.2 to machines in which previous TLS versions have been disabled.
                                </li>
                                <li>Earlier, while integrating Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) with Password Manager Pro under 'Mail Server Setting', secure connections over SSL or TLS could not be configured. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v8500 till v9100, Active Directory Single Sign-on could not be enabled if the 'Secondary Domain Controllers' field held more than 100 characters. This is now changed to accept up to 250 characters.
                                </li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9100, any resource/account/resource group access permission changes for user groups were not notified via email despite the alert configuration under General Settings. This has been fixed.

                                <li>From v9000 till v9100, the 'Edit User' screen did not load the Duo Username for Duo TFA-enabled users. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9100, duplicate names could be assigned for two user groups by changing the name of one group in 'Edit Group Attributes' to match the other group's name. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>From v9000 till v9100, users were unable to download files stored under the 'File Store' resource type. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>When Password Manager Pro (from v9000 till v9100) was launched on Firefox 54, checkboxes weren't displayed across multiple tabs such as Resources, Users, and Groups. This has been fixed.</li>

                                <li>Earlier, while retrieving the list of resources that are owned/shared to an API user with RESTful API, only those resources with at least one account associated under them were retrieved. This API has now been enhanced

                                <li>In v9000, while editing resources in bulk, if any of the selected resources had notes stored under them, the notes field of that resource became empty once the edits were saved. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In v9000, when an existing custom report was edited and saved, the 'Mail Report as' option under Schedule Report settings for that custom report was automatically reset to PDF from earlier configured setting if any. This

                                <li>Earlier, when a resource was shared with a user and the user eventually marked that resource as their favorite, the resource still showed up in the user's 'Favorites' and 'Recently Accessed' lists even after its share permission
                                    had been revoked. This has been fixed.</li>

                                    not apply in such scenarios and the report was generated from all the audit records available. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, while fetching the list of services that are run using a Windows Domain user account, if the name of a particular Windows service consisted of a colon symbol ( : ), the characters present after the colon in that
                                    name were not fetched. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, MS SQL server replication for High Availability could not be configured if the username or password of either the primary or secondary backend database contained a single quote ( ' ). This has been fixed.

                                <li>Earlier, to reset the login password of one's Password Manager Pro account through 'Forgot Password' method, the user had to click on the given link in the login screen, provide username and email details, and then the
                                    new password was directly sent to the provided email address. Henceforth, after providing username and email details, the user will only receive a link to their inbox and will be able to access the new password upon
                                    clicking that link.</li>
                                <li>The third party Java software library that comes bundled with Password Manager Pro to support NTLM authentication has been upgraded from v1.1.22 to the vendor's latest release v1.2.0, which now uses TCP transport instead

                                    owned by the user who is creating the group and on the ones shared with "Manage" permission. Shared resources are being excluded in the new version. Once you move to the latest version, some resources that were part
                                    of a criteria-based dynamic group created by you would have been removed from the group due to this change.<br><br> In the new design too, administrators who have access to a dynamic group with "Manage" permission (henceforth
                                    known as "Full Access" permission) shall be able to add the resources owned by them to that group. That means, the resources owned by them shall become part of the dynamic group upon satisfying the criteria.<br><br>
                                    <strong>Note</strong>: This change was introduced in PMP 8.0 for those who installed the full version afresh. That means, for customers who have directly installed builds 8000 and above, this behavior remains the same.
                                    The above change will be felt only by customers who have been using Password Manager Pro before the 8000 build was released.

                                <li><strong>MIB Update for SNMP Trap Settings</strong><br><br> This version includes an update to the MIB (MANAGEENGINE-PMP-MIB), which is integral to SNMP trap configuration in Password Manager Pro. As part of the update,
                                    the OIDs used to identify the VarBinds have been revised.</li>
                                <li>In v7000 and above, while retrieving passwords, if the user was enforced to provide a reason as configured by the admin, the user was able to retrieve passwords from "Pass Cards" and "All My Passwords" UI by adding just
                                    a space in the reason field. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In v8600 and above, when Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication was configured and enabled for users, users from only one specific AAD tenant were able to log in to Password Manager Pro using their AAD credentials
                                    while users in other tenants faced login errors. This has been fixed now, by updating the value of the endpoint to which the sign-in requests are sent from Password Manager Pro.</li>
                                <li>In v8700 and above, role summary report could not be generated for a role if the respective role name comprised Japanese characters. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In v8700 and above, admins using Password Manager Pro's Premium edition were unable to create API users even though XML-RPC API/SSH CLI access and related operations were allowed in the premium edition. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>In v8700 and above, if an admin disables the "Personal" tab for users by unchecking the respective option under General Settings, the option itself disappeared from view the next time when the admin accessed General Settings.
                                    This has been fixed. </li>
                                <li>Earlier, in MSP editions, client organizations that had been marked as favorite by respective users were not displayed at the top of the list as they should be. Instead, the client org that one user had most recently marked
                                    as their favorite was globally displayed at the top for all users. This has been fixed. </li>
                                <li>Earlier, while importing users from AD/Azure AD, when the admin specifies the users to be imported as comma separated values, the action resulted in error if there was spacing after the commas. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, when users share their resource group with other users, the former faced resource group duplication issues in their UI dashboard whenever the latter added a new resource to that shared resource group. This has
                                    been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, while adding an account under a resource, the account could not be saved if the user had earlier enabled a custom password field under "Account Additional Fields" and entered a password containing specific special
                                    characters including Greater Than/Less Than ( "&lt;", "&gt;" ) symbols in that field. This has been fixed.</li>
                                <li>Earlier, during manual resource addition operation, the user was able to add two different accounts under the same name but different casing. However, while saving the added accounts, the second account's user-provided
                                    password was automatically replaced with the first account's password. This has been fixed. </li>
                                <li>Customers who upgraded to 8700 from any of the older versions faced an issue with the "Personal" tab, i.e. if they had earlier disabled the Personal tab for users, the provision was automatically enabled for users after
                                    the upgrade. This has been fixed. </li>

                            <li>Earlier, when a scheduled password reset was carried out for a Windows domain account after password expiry, the reset action results were at times audited as failed even though the password was successfully reset in the resource.
                                This happened if the domain account had services and IIS app pools associated with it. This has been fixed.</li>

                            <li>In v8700, under custom roles feature, when a group of users were moved in bulk from their current roles to an administrator-type role using "Change Roles", the operation failed during certain circumstances owing to insufficient
                                number of administrator licenses even though adequate licenses were in fact available. This has been fixed now.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when super administrators carried out edits to their own profile such as password policy or email ID changes, they lost their super administrator privilege automatically when they saved the edits; and they were reverted
                                to their old role. This has been fixed now.</li>
                            <li>In v8700, when an administrator viewed the list of users who were members of a user group, the database values of the users' "Role" column were displayed in the web UI table view. This has been fixed now.

                            <li>Earlier, while importing resources from a CSV file, when "Overwriting of existing resources" is enabled by a user along with a configuration setting to overwrite a resource only when it is owned by that user resources owned
                                by other users were overwritten in certain circumstances despite the owner check. This has been fixed now.</li>

                            <li>A function level access control vulnerability resulted in unauthorized permission which allowed a user to change their current role to another administrator-type role. When a user was assigned a custom role with operational
                                scope only to "Change user roles" and no other administrator privilege, that user could change their own role to another administrator-type role that contained higher operational scope. This has been fixed now.</li>

                            <li><strong>Custom Roles :</strong> Option to create custom roles for users, with provision to define operational scope for each role in a fine-grained manner. You can allow or restrict operations for the custom role (from a list
                                of 100+ options like adding resources, allowing remote access to resources, creating policies etc.) and assign the role to desired number of users.

                            </li>
                            <li>In v8000 and above, while exporting password inventory report in .xls format for two or more resource groups, the report was generated for only one random group instead of all selected groups. This has been fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>In v8603 and above, when a user selected a group of resources and attempted to bulk edit one/many of the resources' attributes, there was an issue while saving the edits. Specifically, the values present in the Notes field
                                of all accounts associated to the selected resources were automatically overwritten with a blank value, even when no edits were carried out by the user to that effect. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v6300 and above, while integrating Password Manager Pro with a PhoneFactor system for two-factor authentication, the option to 'Test Agent Connection' returned an error if the user had manually specified account credentials
                                and agent service URL (this issue did not occur when the credentials had been stored in Password Manager Pro). This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, when a password user tries to export in plain-text the resources in a resource group shared with him/her, the exported spreadsheet (.xlsx) was blank. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v8505 and above, the 'Copy to Clipboard' option across the GUI did not work in Chrome browser. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v8601 and above, when a user tried to update password for scheduled tasks from Password Manager Pro, the reset failed due to a double quote missing in the reset command. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, users were unable to launch RDP connections from Password Manager Pro's web-interface when the respective username contained a space or the password contained a percent sign ( % ). This has been fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, when details such as name, description etc. were provided in Japanese for resources, the Japanese characters were not displayed in the PDF version of Canned and Query reports generated for the respective resources.
                                This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, in the MSP edition, there was a configuration issue with the Replicate Settings option available under Organization actions. The issue caused the User Group Settings to replicate time and over in the client org, with
                                respect to the number of times the user clicks on Replicate Settings. This in turn interfered with the workflow of various options under User Group Settings. This has been fixed.

                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, integrity checks for password synchronization once enabled was carried out for all passwords on a daily basis by default. The administrator could only adjust the time at which the check should be carried. Henceforth,
                                integrity checks can be scheduled to be run at desired time intervals.</li>

                            <li>Earlier, in the Japanese version of Password Manager Pro, text inputs in the 'Reason' field syslog messages sent from the tool were either incomplete or comprised of garbled characters. This has been fixed now.

                            <li>Earlier, if the option 'unique password generated through email' is configured for two-factor authentication in Password Manager Pro, the OTP generated and sent to a user's email id during a login attempt did not expire instantly
                                upon one-time usage. The OTP could be reused multiple times for login from different systems as long as the primary login session remained active. This has been fixed now.

                            <li>In order to negate the possibility of DOS attacks, threshold limits have been introduced for HTTP operations (using POST method) from the web console. The threshold limits restrict the number of times that a particular HTTP

                        <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lock Password Manager Pro Users</strong><br> Option to temporarily prevent any user from accessing Password Manager Pro by locking down the respective account. The user accounts can be unlocked anytime, with all user
                                settings intact including share permissions.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>New REST APIs</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To edit resources.</li>
                                    <li>To edit/delete accounts</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Support for Duo Security Two-factor Authentication</strong><br> Support for Duo Security two factor authentication for login to Password Manager Pro. Already, Password Manager Pro supports Google Authenticator, PhoneFactor,
                                RSA SecurID, a one-time, randomly generated unique password, and any RADIUS-compliant two factor authentication mechanism as the second level of authentication for two factor authentication.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Add Secondary Domain Controllers to a Windows Domain Resource<br>
                                </strong> While creating a Windows Domain resource, users can add the DNS Name / IP Address details of secondary (or multiple) domain controllers associated with the resource. Once added, they can also auto log on to all
                                associated domain controllers using the same Windows Domain account.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>MSP Edition</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Earlier, the "Import Organization from CSV file" feature did not provide the option to attribute an "Account Manager" for the organization during the import itself. As a result, once organization details were imported
                                        from the CSV file, the MSP admin had to separately assign an administrator in Password Manager Pro as the Account Manager. Henceforth, an Account Manager column containing the administrator "username" can be added
                                        in the CSV file itself and directly attributed to the new organization during import.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Earlier, when the administrator configured "Replicate settings across client orgs," the saved settings were applicable only for new client orgs and not for existing orgs. As a result, resource/user groups, share settings,
                                        and additional fields were not replicated in the existing orgs. Now, a new option has been introduced to sync the newly configured replication settings (except additional fields) across existing client orgs as well,
                                        either all or desired.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>While creating new users via RESTful API, they can now also be added to a new or existing user group.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, while adding a new resource with Password Manager Pro via RESTful APIs, API users had default permission to specify another existing user as the resource owner. The API user could also edit a resource owned by other
                                users. Now, an option has been introduced to disable API users from adding/editing resources under other user's ownership.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, while adding a new Windows Domain resource, the "Configure password reset for associated service accounts and IIS AppPool accounts" section did not give further options for the user to enable/disable password resets
                                separately for service accounts, scheduled tasks, and IIS AppPool accounts. Password resets could be configured either for all or none of them, regardless of whether services/IIS AppPools were run using the domain account.
                                Now, new options have been introduced which allows the user to exclusively choose required password resets"among service accounts, scheduled tasks, and IIS AppPools as well as service restart options.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when password resets for Windows Scheduled Tasks were carried out, users faced version compatibility issues for Task Scheduler if the target Windows server edition was different from that of server in which Password
                                Manager Pro was running. To solve such platform issues, the Scheduled Tasks password reset mechanism has been enhanced to also support Task Scheduler 2.0.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when two-factor authentication (TFA) was enabled, Password Manager Pro's login screen asked for the username first, and both primary password and TFA credential were requested together in a fresh second screen. Henceforth,
                                the user has to input both username and password (first level of authentication) in the login screen. Only when the primary authentication succeeds, the user will prompted for the TFA credential in a new screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, while importing resources from Active Directory under "Resource Discovery" option, comma separated values entered in the "Resources to import" field were not imported properly. Only the first value was imported.
                                This has been fixed now.</li>
                            <li>In v8600, when a user group was restricted from storing their personal passwords in Password Manager Pro, the users of that group were unable to retrieve their enterprise passwords. This happened only when the global option
                                to manage personal passwords was enabled under General Settings, but disabled for that specific user group. This has been fixed now.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Security Fixes</strong></p>
                        <p>A function level access control vulnerability resulted in unauthorized permission to edit Password Manager Pro's pre-defined password policies (Strong/Medium/Low/Offline Password Fil). In addition, the vulnerability also allowed
                            the deletion of the password policy that has been set as default. This has been fixed now.

                        </h3>
                        <p><strong>New Features &amp; Enhancements</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Azure AD Integration</strong><br> Introducing out-of-the-box integration with Azure Active Directory (AD), which allows users to login to Password Manager Pro with their Azure AD credentials, in both Windows and Linux
                                platforms. The integration also allows import of users and user groups from Azure AD to Password Manager Pro, and keeps data synchronized through Azure AD sync schedules.
                                <br><br></li>
                            <li><strong>Query Reports</strong><br> This new addition to the Reports section now allows administrators to construct reports by writing their own SQL statements. The statements can be used to directly query the Password Manager
                                Pro database and fetch required information to address unique reporting requirements.
                                <br><br></li>
                            <li><strong>Store Recorded Sessions in an External Location</strong><br> Video recordings of RDP, SSH, Telnet, and SQL sessions will hereafter be stored in an external location, instead of Password Manager Pro database. Users can
                                configure two external locations, one primary and another backup, where recorded sessions will be stored automatically once the operation is audited in Password Manager Pro, provided there is connectivity between the configured
                                locations and Password Manager Pro server. For earlier recorded sessions stored in Password Manager Pro database, export options are given to move them to the configured external location.<br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Purging of Recorded Sessions now available, as a separate operation</strong><br> Earlier, video recordings of RDP, SSH, Telnet, and SQL sessions could not be purged separately. The sessions could be purged only as a
                                part of user audit purge. But, purging user audit records just to remove sessions also removed the operations details such as user account used to launch session, date and time, and more. Now, there are alternate options
                                to configure purging of recorded sessions alone and retain the audit details of the operation.

                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, when the SSL certificate for the server was changed, RDP sessions could not launched automatically and the user had to manually install the certificate again to initiate a session. Now, the issue is fixed and new certificates
                                will be automatically verified when RDP sessions are launched.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Server JRE that comes bundled with Password Manager Pro is upgraded from v1.7.0_71 to v1.8.0_102 due to security vulnerabilities in the older version. PostgreSQL and Tomcat server have also been upgraded to the latest versions
                                9.5.3 and 8.0.20 respectively.</li>
                            <li>Maverick Legacy libraries used for SSH CLI in Password Manager Pro have been upgraded to the latest versions.
                            </li>
                            <li>OpenSSL libraries used in Password Manager Pro have been upgraded from 0.9.8g to 1.0.2j, the latest version released with vulnerability fixes.</li>
                            <li>Reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities which resulted in unauthorized permission to carry out critical operations were found in Landing Server configuration, Rebranding, and Reports features. This has been fixed now.</li>
                            <li>A vulnerability which resulted in unauthorized permission to delete Default Resource Types in Password Manager Pro has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>A CSRF vulnerability, which resulted in unauthorized permission to change the default resource type set for any resource, has been fixed.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Option to trigger a bulk password reset in one click for all the resources that a specific user has access to, i.e. resources owned by or shared with that user. This allows the administrator to reset all passwords related to
                                a specific user in case they leave the organization and then transfer those resources to another user.</li>
                            <li>While evaluating Password Manager Pro with the 30-day trial edition, users can now switch instantly between the different product editions available (Standard / Premium / Enterprise) and test the desired edition.
                            </li>
                            <li>In Windows account discovery feature, an additional check has been introduced which allows the user to choose not to import any disabled computer account in the Active Directory during the discovery process. The user also has
                                an option now to identify existing resources in Password Manager Pro that have been marked as disabled in AD and delete them.</li>
                            <li>Resources and groups can now be imported directly from KeePass (1.x and 2.x) to Password Manager Pro.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, when cross-domain authentication is used for Windows discovery tasks, local accounts and service accounts were not enumerated from the selected domain. This issue is fixed now.</li>
                            <li>A new report named "Unshared Passwords" report has been added to the 'Canned Reports' section. The report lists all the passwords that have not been shared with any user in Password Manager Pro.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Earlier, password integrity checks failed for certain target systems in agent mode as Password Manager Pro server reported connection failure. This issue has been fixed now.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, 'Rebranding' settings could not be edited when Password Manager Pro web-interface is connected using Internet Explorer. This issue is fixed now.</li>
                            <li>In 'Personal Passwords' section, after a custom category is set as default, users could not add new accounts or delete existing accounts in that particular category. This issue is fixed now.</li>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, new resource addition operations could not be completed successfully if the DNS Name / IP Address field contained the character "_" (Underscore). This issue is fixed now.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, Windows account discovery tasks could not be completed if the admin password supplied to carry out the operation contained a double quote ("). This issue is fixed now.

                            <li>Earlier, upgrade packs could be applied only to Password Manager Pro's primary installation, and high availability had to reconfigured every time after the upgrade. Henceforth, upgrade packs can be directly applied to the secondary
                                installation as well, without any need to reconfigure high availability.</li>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, when Password Manager Pro server was restarted, personal password management option was getting enabled even in cases where it had been disabled by the administrator. This has been fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, there were AD sync issues while importing users and resources from different domains. Resources/users from the wrong domain were imported for a few sync schedules when they were run again after the first import operation.
                                This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, in the MSP edition, while providing a user group with 'Manage Organization' permission for different orgs, only 100 organizations could be allotted to that user group. This limit has been removed now.
                            </li>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, while adding a new account under a resource, the add operation could not be successfully completed if the 'Notes' field contained more than 230 characters. This issue is fixed.

                            <li>Earlier, for any resource group, if the option 'Reset passwords upon expiry' was enabled, the option did not work for the resources within the group for which access control had been configured. This issue is fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>In v8500 and above, while adding a Linux resource, the add operation could not be completed if 'Private Key' field was left blank. This issue is fixed.</li>

                            <li>Earlier, when a domain admin account was shared with users for RDP auto logon to related domain member machines, the users could use that domain account credentials to log in to the domain controller as well. Now, while sharing
                                domain admin accounts with users for auto logon purposes, an optional check is given to prevent RDP connections to the domain controller resource.</li>
                            <li>A new check has been introduced, while adding a Windows resource, to restrict users from using the local account of that resource to launch RDP connection, and instead use only the domain account to connect to the resource.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when the last remaining user in an organization unit (OU) was removed in AD, the same user did not get removed from the corresponding user group in Password Manager Pro. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, in the "Show Passwords" table under "All My Passwords," the selected column sort order did not persist for non-admin users once they navigated to other tabs. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>In Password Manager Pro Japanese edition, audit log for the operation 'Discovery Task Deletion' was not captured properly in the audit records. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, under Passcard option, when the provided link is opened to access the concerned account, the password could not be viewed properly if the Resource Name or Account Name shown in the GetPasscard page contained a "space."
                                This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, for Add Resource operations, account addition step failed if the concerned account's password field contained specific characters (&lt;&gt;). This issue is fixed.

                            <li>Earlier, when users tried to reset Google Authenticator settings from the Password Manager Pro login page, the option did not work due to case-sensitive issues or if the username contained '\' (Backslash). This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v8500, users were unable to add new resources under the pre-defined type 'PostgreSQL,' if they had earlier created and saved 'PostgreSQL' as a custom resource type. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>In v8303, while importing OUs from Active Directory, all the resources in the 'Default Group' in Password Manager Pro were automatically removed if the name of any of the OUs contained a comma (,). This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, in the UI screen, Admin--&gt;Add Resource--&gt;Add Accounts, when an account was added, password of the added account was partially revealed along with the account name in the display box beneath. This happened if
                                the password contained both double quotes (") and greater-than sign (&gt;), in that order. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, under "Scheduled Password Reset," while setting Password to use, the option "Assign the same password to all user accounts, but change it during every schedule" did not work properly. Instead of a same password, unique
                                passwords were set for each account. This issue is fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, while using RESTful API to add or modify a resource, the users could not use the characters, '&lt;' and '&gt;' in the account password. This limitation has been removed now.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Password Manager Pro now comes with a comprehensive security filter that helps protect the solution against a host of vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In addition,
                                to prevent any unauthorized actions by genuine users (by manipulating the parameters in the URLs), authorization check has been enabled for every single action involving a database query through URLs (CVE-2016-1161).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Users making use of LDAP authentication were able to access their Password Manager Pro account through PMP's browser extensions by supplying a blank password. This issue was found only in PMP's browser extensions and <strong>NOT</strong>                                in the web version. However, since the fix involves changes in APIs in the web version, this security fix is being provided. Customers of all versions of PMP (till 8403), who are using browser extensions with LDAP authentication
                                should apply this fix, in addition to upgrading the browser extension separately.</li>

                            <li>Provision to customize password expiry report based on expiration date of passwords. With this option, you can now generate the list of passwords that are about to expire during a specified period of time. For instance, you
                                can find passwords that will expire in the next 5 days.</li>
                            <li>Privileged accounts can now be marked as favorites from the search result view itself.
                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, custom reports, once saved, could not be duplicated with additional edits. Now, 'Save as new' option has been added to create duplicate copies of saved custom reports. Also, a direct link to create custom reports has
                                been added under 'Audit' tab.</li>
                            <li>RESTful API to fetch account details has been enhanced to include password expiry status, compliance status and reason in case of non-compliance, and configured policy for the accounts.</li>
                            <li>Privileged accounts can now be marked as favorites from the search result view itself. Earlier, when password compliance notifications were configured for individual resource groups, in certain rare scenarios, some compliant
                                passwords were also notified as non-compliant. This issue has been fixed.

                            <li>Earlier, when the option "Allow all admin users to manipulate the entire explorer tree" had been enabled in "General Settings", all resource groups, including unshared groups were displayed in the explorer tree structure (only
                                the names of the unshared groups were displayed in grey text; the underlying passwords were not shown). Now, unshared groups can be hidden from view.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, users had to manually go to 'Resources' tab and select the resource group name under 'Show Resources of' option to view the list of resources in each group. Now, resource group names have been hyperlinked to automatically
                                take the user to 'Resources' tab and display the corresponding resources.

                            </li>
                            <li>Earlier, URL query string parameters were passed through HTTP GET method for 'Password Change' and 'Password Export' features, which was a concern since GET holds parameters in history. This has been changed now by using HTTP
                                POST for query strings instead of HTTP GET.</li>

                            <li><strong>SAML 2.0 support</strong>: User authentication mechanism in Password Manager Pro has now been strengthened with SAML 2.0 support. Password Manager Pro now integrates with federated identity management solutions for
                                single sign-on. Technically, Password Manager Pro acts as the SAML service provider, and it integrates with SAML identity providers. The new integration helps leverage the identity provider's authentication to access Password
                                Manager Pro. Users who have deployed Okta, OneLogin or any other SAML identity provider can automatically log in to the Password Manager Pro application from the respective identity provider's GUI without supplying credentials,
                                after configuring PMP with the identity provider.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Session Shadowing</strong>: Session recording capability has been extended to enable real-time monitoring of sensitive privileged sessions launched by users. Administrators may also terminate sessions in real time if
                                any suspicious activity is found, giving admins complete control over privileged sessions.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Language Selection</strong>: PMP administrator can now select the language for all users in 'General Settings'. Password Manager Pro can be localized in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Polish.

                            <li>For privileged session management, Password Manager Pro acts as the Gateway for launching Windows RDP and SSH sessions from the user's browser. These sessions are launched within a HTML5 compatible browser and the connection
                                to the end devices are tunneled through the PMP server that acts as the session gateway, while also recording the session. In the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, launching RDP sessions did not work. The screen closes
                                immediately after launching the session. This has been fixed.

                            <li>PMP v7001 was identified to be having directory traversal vulnerability. This has been fixed by updating the RDP gateway.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when PMP was installed in other language boxes, audit trails were getting recorded in the respective language though the PMP web GUI was in English. This has been fixed.

                            <li>In v7001, when PMP license key with no multi-language support was installed, PMP stopped recording audit trails after a server restart. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Possibility for an XSS vulnerability (which can be triggered during authentication), was identified in PMP v7001. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when configuring PMP to run in FIPS 140-2 compliant mode, nss libraries were required to be downloaded. Now, PMP uses nss v3.12.4 and it comes bundled with that.

                                to remote devices via SSH connections due to security reasons and network segmentation. Instead, data center admins working remotely must first connect to a landing server and then "hop" to the target system. Administrators
                                can now configure landing servers and their login credentials and then associate them with the resources being managed by Password Manager Pro. In turn, admins can launch a one-click connection with the remote resources
                                without worrying about the intermediate hops. While the admin experiences a direct connection, Password Manager Pro automatically executes all of the intermediate hops in the background, establishing a connection with each
                                landing server and finally with the remote resource.</li>

                            <li>Provision to allow admin users to manipulate the entire explorer tree structure in any manner as they wish. Once this is option enabled, PMP creates an organization wide, global explorer tree structure containing the names
                                of resource groups under a root node. Any administrator in PMP would be able to create/edit the explorer tree structure of resource groups. The tree structure will be accessible to all admins, password admins and end users.
                                Admins and password admins can add their resource groups anywhere into the global tree and the whole structure will be available for view to all the end users. If this option is disabled, users can modify only their portion

                            <li>Leveraging the power of HTML 5, PMP 6.5 brings the first-in-class auto logon mechanisms for launching Windows RDP, SSH and Telnet sessions. While current solutions require inconvenient and insecure methods like end-point agents,
                                helper programs at user desktop and browser plug-ins, the only requirement for PMP's cutting-edge solution is a HTML 5 compatible web browser. Users can launch highly secure and completely emulated Windows RDP, SSH and
                                Telnet sessions from within the browser with a single click, not requiring any access to passwords

                                it to be managed by PMP has been removed. PMP does not allow the encryption key to be stored within its installation folder. This is done to ensure that the encryption key and the encrypted data, in both live and backed-up
                                database, do not reside together. It is strongly recommend that you move and store this encryption key outside of the machine in which PMP is installed - in another machine or an external drive.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when exporting the personal passwords, the custom fields were not shown in plain-text. This issue has been fixed.</li>

                            <li>Prior to 6400, some of&nbsp;the communication between PMP server and agents was initiated by the server, which required the agents to keep a TCP port open. To eliminate this risk and the need to manipulate firewall rules to
                                allow traffic to a non-standard port on the agent side, the communication model is changed where the agents always initiate communication with the server. The agents periodically check for tasks by opening a secure connection
                                with the server and no longer need to have a port open in the system they are installed.

                            <li>Earlier, while implementing concurrency control in Password Request-Release workflow, the maximum time period up to which the password was to be available exclusively for a particular user was specified in hours. This has been
                                changed to minutes to enable granting of exclusive privilege less than one hour

                            <li>Earlier, MD5 algorithm was used for hasing the PMP user passwords for local authentication. Now, SHA 512 is being used.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when Single Sign-On was enabled, audit entries related to user login to PMP were not recorded. This issue has been fixed now</li>

                            <li>Earlier, when there were large number of passwords, loading of the dashboard took some time. This has now been optimized</li>
                            <li>Earlier, there were issues in carrying out password synchronization / verification using a single account in Linux. This has been fixed.</li>
                            <li>Earlier, when Active Directory authentication was enabled, there were problems in logging in to PMP using the local authentication when a AD user was deleted. This has been fixed.</li>
