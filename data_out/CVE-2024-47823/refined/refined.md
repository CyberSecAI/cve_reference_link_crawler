{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The file extension of an uploaded file was being guessed based on the MIME type instead of using the actual file extension from the file name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "MIME type validation bypass",
      "Insecure file handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could upload a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) but with a malicious file extension (e.g., `.php`) and execute it on the remote server if the server was configured to execute PHP files and the filename was constructed using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`.",
    "attack_vectors": "Uploading a file with a manipulated file extension and a valid MIME type.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to upload files to the server, and the server needs to be configured to execute php files, also the server code must use `$file->getClientOriginalName()` when storing the file."
