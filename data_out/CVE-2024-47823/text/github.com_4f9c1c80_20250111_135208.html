# Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads

High

[calebporzio](/calebporzio)
published
GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp
Oct 8, 2024

## Package

composer

livewire/livewire
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0-beta.1, < 3.5.2
< 2.12.7

## Patched versions

3.5.2
2.12.7

## Description

In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension.

If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack:

* Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`
* Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk
* Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files

### PoC

In the following scenario, an attacker could upload a file called `shell.php` with an `image/png` MIME type and execute it on the remote server.

```
class SomeComponent extends Component
{
    use WithFileUploads;

    #[Validate('image|extensions:png')]
    public $file;

    public function save()
    {
        $this->validate();

        $this->file->storeAs(
            path: 'images',
            name: $this->file->getClientOriginalName(),
            options: ['disk' => 'public'],
        );
    }
}
```

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47823
