### @calebporzio **[calebporzio](/calebporzio)** commented [Jul 2, 2024](#issue-2387161148)

Currently Livewire derives the extension of an uploaded file from it's MIME type.

This poses a problem for image validation, because, typically, image validation relies on two basic pillars:

1. Ensuring the mime type of the file is an image type
2. Ensuring the file extension is an image type

Currently Livewire creates an environment where you're only validating mime types and could potentially lead to a vulnerability if all of the following conditions were met:

1. You construct a stored filename based on `$file->getClientOriginalExtension()`
2. You are storing files directly on your server in a public storage disk
3. Your nginx configuration allows executing files with .php extensions that aren't index.php

To better explain, here's a potentially vulnerable Livewire component:

```
class SomeComponent extends Component
{
    use WithFileUploads;

    #[Validate('extensions:png')]
    public $file;

    public function save()
    {
        $this->validate();

        $this->file->storeAs(
            path: 'images',
            name: $this->file->getClientOriginalName(),
            options: ['disk' => 'public'],
        );
    }
```

In this scenario, a user could upload a file called `malicious.php` with a `image/png` MIME type and execute it on your server (assuming your nginx configuration allows).

This PR fixes the vulnerability by no longer deriving the temporary file upload extension from the MIME type, but rather from the actual file extension uploaded instead.

This makes it so that `extensions:png` validation will work and catch non-PHP extension files.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This looks good to me! I wasn't able to exploit the vulnerability anymore. Since we are now using the extension from the filename, Laravel's `Illuminate\Validation\Concerns\ValidatesAttributes::shouldBlockPhpUpload()` can take into action blocking PHP extensions, even if the developer only validates the mime type.  Caution  **However, I highly recommend to always validate the mime type and the file extension!** |
