# Releasenotes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Security Issue - Update as soon as possible!

It rarely happens, but with this update we are closing a critical security bug. Security Analyst Christian P√∂schl and the company usd AG (<https://www.usd.de/en/>) have informed us in with a responsible disclosure that sensitive data could be visible to third parties (when calling setup.php via the browser), especially the LDAP connection, could be visible to third parties. We have closed this gap immediately and therefore also published this release earlier.

The problem also affects earlier tine versions, which is why the still supported 2022.11 ("Pino") has also been updated.

We recommend installing the update as soon as possible, especially if the LDAP functionalities of tine are used and the call of setup.php is not protected separately, e.g. by an htaccess / basic authentication. We have also updated the Docker image to the effect that now protects the setup.php with an additional password query.

The fix can be found here: [5d556a1](https://github.com/tine-groupware/tine/commit/5d556a1225aa358cbf7cfbeae518c9386b46f516)

Information about the docker image setup.php basic auth can be found in the tine docs: <https://tine-docu.s3web.rz1.metaways.net/operators/Installation_Guide/#setupphp-ui>
