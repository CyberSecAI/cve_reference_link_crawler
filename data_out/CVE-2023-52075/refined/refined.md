- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper error caching on Cloudflare for the ReVanced API. This results in repeated requests to the API when errors occur, triggering rate limits.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient error handling and caching mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition can be triggered due to excessive requests caused by the lack of error caching, leading to a rate limiter being activated and impacting all API users.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker doesn't require any specific privileges, user interaction, or special position. The attack is triggered by a situation where the API returns an error, causing the client to retry repeatedly.
