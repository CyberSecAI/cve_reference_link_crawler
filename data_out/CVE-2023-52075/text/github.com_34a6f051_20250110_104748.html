# Probability of Denial of Service due to lack of error caching

## Patched versions

N/A

## Description

### Summary

Lack of error caching causes rate limit to be triggered thus increasing server load.

### Details

Errors are not being cached (or properly cached) on Cloudflare for the ReVanced API, with multiple requests to the API repeatedly resulting in a rate-limiter kicking in to prevent being attacked.

### PoC

In <https://revanced.app> @ [03df6ba641c0db8258b6e929208930ad86f72ffc](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-website/commit/03df6ba641c0db8258b6e929208930ad86f72ffc), when the API is down, the site will retry the accessing the API every ~3 seconds (which isn't ideal since we're just unintentionally dosing the API [#208](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-website/issues/208))

### Suggestion

Implement proper error caching for the ReVanced API.

### Impact

All users using the API

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
