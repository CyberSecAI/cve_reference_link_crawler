Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `ddfd497afd017a6946c582a1a806687fdac888bf`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the `/template-versions/:id` endpoint. The original SQL query was susceptible to leaking information, specifically template version data, to unauthorized users.  Specifically, the query to fetch the template version did not properly check if the user had the required permission to access the resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The endpoint used the `versionId` directly from the URL without ensuring that the user had the permission to access the associated project for a given template version.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The original query didn't ensure that the user has access to the project associated with the template version, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing template version details they are not authorized to view. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about projects and their configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/template-versions/:id` endpoint by providing a `versionId` value in the request path parameter.
*   An attacker could attempt to iterate through various `versionId` values to enumerate template version resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be an authenticated user on the platform.
*   The attacker needs to know or be able to guess valid `versionId` values.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code was in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/template-versions.ts`. The original query fetched a template version based on the `id` without verifying user permissions.

The following code snippet shows the fix, specifically the changes to SQL query which is updated to join with the project table and check project id against ctx.state.projectId:

  ctx.throw(401, "You do not have access to this ressource.")
  }

  select * from template where project_id = ${projectId} and id = ${version.templateId}
  `
 
  ctx.body = { ...version, template }
```
The fix introduces an additional check by joining the `template_version` table with the `template` and `project` tables and verifying the `project_id` against the `projectId` from the context.

In summary, the commit `ddfd497afd017a6946c582a1a806687fdac888bf` fixed an IDOR vulnerability by implementing proper authorization checks in the `/template-versions/:id` endpoint, ensuring that only users with the correct permissions can access template version data.
