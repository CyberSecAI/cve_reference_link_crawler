Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization and escaping of certain plugin settings within the "GS Logo Slider Lite" plugin. Specifically, the `shortcode_settings[gs_l_theme]` parameter is vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving shortcode settings, allowing a malicious payload to be stored in the database. This payload is then executed when the shortcode is displayed on a page/post.
- **Lack of input sanitization and output escaping:** The plugin does not sanitize the input before storing it and does not escape it before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page/post. This allows the attacker to perform various actions like:
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Steal session cookies.
    - Modify the content of the page.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Settings:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `shortcode_settings[gs_l_theme]` parameter when saving a logo shortcode through the plugin's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin or High-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or a user role with the ability to create and save shortcodes.
- **Access to the Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be able to access the plugin's shortcode settings page or intercept the request used to save the settings.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the "GS Logo Slider Lite" plugin prior to 3.6.9.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled, which makes the vulnerability particularly dangerous for multi-site setups.
- A proof of concept is provided, detailing the exact steps to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.5 (low), likely because it requires a high-privilege user.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79.
