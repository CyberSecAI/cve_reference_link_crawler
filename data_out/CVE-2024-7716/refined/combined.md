## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# GS Logo Slider Lite < 3.6.9 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a Logo Shortcode
2. Intercept the request when saving the shortcode
3. Insert the payload `321321"test='+onmouseover=alert(1)//` into the `shortcode\_settings[gs\_l\_theme]` parameter
4. Add the shortcode to a post or page and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
