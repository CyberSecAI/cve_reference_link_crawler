{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The website application does not properly validate user-submitted data (type, length, business parameter validity) and does not effectively filter special characters in user inputs. This allows user-controlled input to be directly incorporated into SQL queries, leading to unintended query execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ajax/getBasicInfo.php` endpoint with a malicious `username` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
  },
    "affected_software": {
        "name": "dingfanzu-CMS",
        "vulnerable_component": "getBasicInfo.php username module"
    },
  "additional_notes": [
    "The provided payload `username=1' or 1=1#` is used to demonstrate the SQL injection.",
     "The vulnerability is located in the `getBasicInfo.php` file and specifically affects the `username` parameter."
