| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2238588#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2023-09-12 15:19:30 UTC  ``` A flaw was discovered in Keycloak Core package.  When a user registers itself through registration flow, the "password" and "password-confirm" field from the form will occur as regular attributes in the users attributes. The password is also created, but the user attributes must not be there. This way, any entities (all users and clients with proper rights/roles) are able to retrieve the users passwords in clear-text.   A malicious user with minimal access reading other users attributes could have access to their password and hence jeopardize the environment.   This shall only affect Keycloak 22.0.2. While Keycloak 22.0.1 is not affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2238588#c1)  Patrick Del Bello    2023-09-12 15:22:39 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-5q66-v53q-pm35>   ``` |  |

# Plaintext Storage of User Password

High

[abstractj](/abstractj)
published
GHSA-5q66-v53q-pm35
Sep 12, 2023

## Package

maven

org.keycloak.userprofile
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

22.0.2

## Patched versions

>= 22.0.3

## Description

A flaw was discovered in Keycloak Core package. When a user registers itself through registration flow, the "password" and "password-confirm" field from the form will occur as regular attributes in the users attributes. The password is also created, but the user attributes must not be there. This way, any entities (all users and clients with proper rights/roles) are able to retrieve the users passwords in clear-text.

### Impact

Passwords for self-registered users are stored as cleartext attributes associated with the user.

### Mitigation

Disable self-registration for users in all realms until patched.

### Severity

High

8.8

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
