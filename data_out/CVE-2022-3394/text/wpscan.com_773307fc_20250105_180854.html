## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP ALL Export Pro < 1.7.9 - Authenticated Code Injection

### Description

The plugin does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.
