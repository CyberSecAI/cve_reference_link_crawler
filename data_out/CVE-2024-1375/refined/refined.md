### Summary:
The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the "Event post" WordPress plugin, versions 5.9.8 and earlier.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing nonce check in the `save_bulkdatas` function within the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of a nonce check allows attackers to forge requests that can be executed by a logged-in user without their consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Metadata Updates:** An unauthenticated attacker can update post metadata by tricking a logged-in user into performing an action (like clicking a malicious link), allowing them to modify event details or other stored information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a forged request that a logged-in user is tricked into executing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:**  The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a link or performing some other action that triggers the forged request.

**Additional Information:**

- The Wordfence description provides more technical details than the CVE description, including the vulnerable function `save_bulkdatas` and the lack of a nonce check. It also gives the name of the researcher, Francesco Carlucci, who discovered the vulnerability.
- There is no known patch available for the vulnerability as of the provided date, and it's advised to consider removing the plugin if possible.
