Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) application displays sensitive information on the ADMIN page. This information relates to backend technologies, including the JVM, database version, and application server details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The application inappropriately exposes sensitive backend technology information. This includes details about the JVM, database version, and the application server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: An attacker could potentially gain knowledge about the underlying infrastructure of the application. This could assist in further attacks by allowing the attacker to identify known vulnerabilities in those specific versions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The vulnerable information is exposed on the application's ADMIN page, which is accessible via the web.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the ADMIN page: The attacker needs access to the ADMIN page of the affected application. This might require the attacker to have some level of authentication, depending on how the application is configured.
