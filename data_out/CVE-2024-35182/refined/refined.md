Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-35182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `order` and `sort` parameters within the Meshery application's API endpoints. Specifically, the values of these parameters were directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allowed for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because the application does not validate or sanitize the `order` and `sort` parameters before using them in database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses the `order` parameter from the request to construct a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to several severe consequences:

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers could use SQL injection to write files to arbitrary locations on the server by exploiting the `ATTACH DATABASE` command and creating tables and data, leading to arbitrary file write capabilities.
*   **Data Access and Modification:** Attackers can access and modify any data stored in the database. This includes sensitive information such as performance profiles (potentially containing session cookies), Meshery application data, and Kubernetes configurations.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including session cookies and credentials, using blind SQL injection techniques.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can create arbitrary database entries or modify existing ones, potentially leading to application malfunction or data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Query Parameters:** The vulnerability is exposed via the `order` and `sort` query parameters in the following HTTP endpoints:
    *   `/api/system/meshync/resources/kinds`
    *   `/api/v2/events`
*   **Malicious SQL Payloads:** Attackers inject SQL code into the `order` and `sort` parameters. Stacked queries using commands like `ATTACH DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, and `INSERT INTO` are used to perform malicious actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Meshery server.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoints (`/api/system/meshync/resources/kinds` and `/api/v2/events`) and the susceptible parameters (`order` and `sort`).
*   **Optional Authentication Bypass:** In some cases, authentication may not be required to exploit the vulnerability, depending on the server configuration and whether authentication is implemented and enforced.  A cookie like `meshery-provider=None` can be used for local, unauthenticated attacks.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found using CodeQL's SQL injection query.
*   The vulnerability was present in Meshery versions up to v0.7.22 and was tested on v0.7.18.
*   The fix involves using a `SanitizeOrderInput` function to ensure proper sanitization of inputs.
