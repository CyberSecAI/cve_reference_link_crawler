# Lack of path validation on font through SVG inline styles

Moderate

[bsweeney](/bsweeney)
published
GHSA-f3qr-qr4x-j273
Feb 21, 2024

## Package

composer

phenx/php-svg-lib
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 0.5.2

## Patched versions

0.5.2

## Description

### Summary

php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib.

### Details

The Style::fromAttributes(), or the Style::parseCssStyle() should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the Style::fromStyleSheets might be reused :

```
                if (
                    \array_key_exists("font-family", $styles)
                    && (
                        \strtolower(\substr($this->href, 0, 7)) === "phar://"
                        || ($this->document->allowExternalReferences === false && \strtolower(\substr($this->href, 0, 5)) !== "data:")
                    )
                ) {
                    unset($style["font-family"]);
                }

```
### PoC

Parsing the following SVG :

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="200" height="200">
    <text x="20" y="35" style="color:red;font-family:phar:///path/to/whatever.phar/blaklis;">My</text>
</svg>

```

will pass the `phar:///path/to/whatever.phar/blaklis` as `$family` in `SurfaceCpdf::setFont`, which is then passed to the canvas `selectFont` as a `$fontName`.

### Impact

Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions, or even RCE, if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
