Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `view_payment.php` file of the House Rental Management System. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `view_payment.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of the application:** An attacker could potentially gain full control of the application.
*   **Access or modification of data:** Sensitive data stored in the database could be accessed, modified, or deleted.
*   **Exploitation of underlying database:** The attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `view_payment.php` file.
*   The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`id`) in the request.
*   The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerable URL is: `http://localhost/rental/view_payment.php?id=12`
* The provided proof of concept demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to exploit the vulnerability.
* The exploit author confirms the vulnerability using Kali Linux, PHP 8.2.12, and Apache 2.4.58.
* The back-end database is identified as MySQL (MariaDB fork)
* The specific database exploited is 'house_rental_latest'.
