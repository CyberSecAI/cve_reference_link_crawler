# Prevent injection of invalid entity ids for "autocomplete" fields

Moderate

[weaverryan](/weaverryan)
published
GHSA-4cpv-669c-r79x
Sep 11, 2023

## Package

composer

symfony/ux-autocomplete
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<2.11.2

## Patched versions

2.11.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain circumstances, an attacker could successfully submit an entity id for an `EntityType` that is *not* part of the valid choices.

Affected applications are any that use:

* A custom `query_builder` option to limit the valid results;

  AND
* An `EntityType` with `'autocomplete' => true` or a custom [AsEntityAutocompleteField](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-autocomplete/current/index.html#usage-in-a-form-with-ajax).

Under this circumstance, if an id is submitted, it is accepted even if the matching record would not be returned by the custom query built with `query_builder`.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in `symfony/ux-autocomplete` version 2.11.2.

### Workarounds

Upgrade to version 2.11.2 or greater of `symfony/ux-autocomplete` or perform extra validation after submit to verify the selected option is valid.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
