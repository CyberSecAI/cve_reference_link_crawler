For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sxsscsrf-2L24bBx6>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Webex Meetings, which is cloud based. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20133: Cisco Webex Meetings Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in Webex Events (classic) programs, email templates, and survey questions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwe38545](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe38545)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20133Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20180: Cisco Webex Meetings Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack against a user.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions in the context of the affected interface with the privileges of the targeted user. These actions could include joining meetings or assistance sessions, create a test, schedule a training session, and modify a meeting registration form.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
