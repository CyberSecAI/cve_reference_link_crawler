## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_23.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, July 23, 2024

The Stable channel has been updated to 127.0.6533.72/73 for Windows, Mac and 127.0.6533.72 for Linux which will roll out over the coming days/weeks. A full list of changes in this build is available in the [Log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/126.0.6478.183..127.0.6533.73?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [22](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:0-M127) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[354788491](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354788491)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/), [libFuzzer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/testing/libfuzzer/README.md), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).
