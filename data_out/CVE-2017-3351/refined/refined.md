This document is a Critical Patch Update Advisory from Oracle, released in January 2017. It includes fixes for various vulnerabilities across numerous Oracle products.

The document does not include specific details for CVE-2017-3351 but rather states it is addressed by a fix that also addresses multiple other CVEs related to Oracle E-Business Suite. The document refers to the Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix section for details. It provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability type and impact.

Here's the breakdown based on the E-Business Suite Risk Matrix, where CVE-2017-3351 is mentioned as being part of a group of CVEs fixed together:

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause isn't explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to issues in the User Interface of Oracle Marketing within Oracle E-Business Suite. This is inferred from the shared risk matrix entry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The document describes the weakness as related to "User Interface" of the "Oracle Marketing" component within "Oracle Common Applications" indicating a potential vulnerability with how the UI handles user inputs, data rendering, or session management. This may encompass cross-site scripting (XSS), injection flaws, or other UI-related issues.

**Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to "High" confidentiality impact and "Low" integrity impact.  The vulnerability does not affect system availability. This means an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (High Confidentiality Impact) and potentially perform unauthorized actions, but the overall functionality is not critically impacted (Low Integrity Impact).

**Attack vectors**: The attack vector is "Network", meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. The protocol used for the attack is HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need privileges but will need to interact with the system for the attack to succeed, as "User Interaction" is noted as "Required" in the risk matrix. The attacker would need to send a malicious request or interact with vulnerable UI elements of the Oracle E-Business Suite.
