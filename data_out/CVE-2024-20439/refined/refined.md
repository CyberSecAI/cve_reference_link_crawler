- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An undocumented static user credential for an administrative account is present in the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Static credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could use the static credentials to log in to the affected system with administrative privileges over the API of the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility application. This allows the attacker to administer Cisco Smart Licensing Utility services on a system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability by using the static credentials to log in to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system and knowledge of the static administrative credential. The Cisco Smart Licensing Utility must be running for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
