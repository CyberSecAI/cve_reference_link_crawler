Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `belong_to` parameter within the notes functionality of the Houzez CRM plugin, combined with a lack of sufficient preparation in the existing SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to append additional SQL queries into existing queries. This could allow them to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `belong_to` parameter within the notes functionality of the plugin.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with "Custom-level (seller)" access or higher. They also need to be able to access the vulnerable notes functionality within the Houzez CRM plugin.
