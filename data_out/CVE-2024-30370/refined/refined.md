**Summary:** This advisory describes a vulnerability in RARLAB WinRAR that allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) protection mechanism.

*   **Root Cause:** A crafted archive entry can cause the creation of an arbitrary file without the Mark-Of-The-Web (MOTW) flag.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of archive entries during extraction, leading to the omission of the MOTW flag.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the MOTW protection, which is typically used by Windows to warn users about files originating from untrusted sources. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user when combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted archive to the victim. The user needs to perform a specific action (e.g., extract the archive). The attack involves user interaction on a malicious page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious archive to the target system, often via a malicious website or email.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
* RARLAB has released an update to address the vulnerability.
