{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the Windows Installer service due to improper handling of junctions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Windows Installer service can be abused by creating a junction to delete a file or directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have low-privileged code execution on the target system. They can then create a junction to manipulate the Windows Installer service."
