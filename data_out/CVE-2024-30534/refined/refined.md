- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions they are not supposed to have access to. Specific impacts can vary.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user.
