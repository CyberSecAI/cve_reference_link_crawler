- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the unsafe use of `sscanf` when parsing the cpuset mask value in the `diagnose sys cpuset` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper input validation within the `sscanf` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing an excessively large cpuset mask value through the CLI. While the advisory states there is no known successful code execution resulting from this vulnerability, this is still a possibility.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a large cpuset mask value via the CLI `diagnose sys cpuset` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user to access the CLI and execute the vulnerable command.
