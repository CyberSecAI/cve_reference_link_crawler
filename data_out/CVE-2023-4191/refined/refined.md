- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows local file inclusion through the `page` parameter in `index.php`. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input provided by the `page` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insecure handling of user-supplied input, specifically the `page` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    - Allows attackers to read sensitive local files, potentially exposing credentials, source code, or configuration details.
    - Enables remote attackers to execute system commands by including `pearcmd.php` and injecting malicious PHP code within it, leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They must also be logged into the application to exploit the vulnerability.
