- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A protection mechanism failure related to XSS and CSRF protections in FortiWeb's GUI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient protections against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass XSS and CSRF protections, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the GUI component of FortiWeb, suggesting that exploitation involves interaction with the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the FortiWeb's GUI, and the CVSS vector indicates a user interaction is required (UI:R), but no specific privilege is needed (PR:N).
