**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar â€“ Amelia WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.0.98

**Root Cause:**
The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input and escape output, specifically within date parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Insufficient output escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.

- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Stealing cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing website content
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts through the `date` parameters in the plugin's URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a crafted URL)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable date parameter and then trick a user into clicking on the link
