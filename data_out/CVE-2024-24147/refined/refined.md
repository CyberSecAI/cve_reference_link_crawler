- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `parseSWF_FILLSTYLEARRAY` function in `parser.c` allocates memory for `SWF_FILLSTYLE` structures but never frees it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak due to missing deallocation of allocated `SWF_FILLSTYLE` memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting available memory through repeated allocation with crafted SWF file.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerable `parseSWF_FILLSTYLEARRAY` function can be used.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted SWF file to the vulnerable software (libming).
