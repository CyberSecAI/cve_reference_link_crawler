The BadgeOS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the delete_badgeos_log_entries function in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete the plugin's log entries.
