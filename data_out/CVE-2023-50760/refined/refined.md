Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50760:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of file uploads in the `user/update_profile_pic.php` page of the Online Notice Board System v1.0. Specifically, the system doesn't check the file's content, extension, or type when a user uploads an image, leading to arbitrary file upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure File Upload: The application does not validate the uploaded file's content, extension, and type.
- Lack of sanitization: The uploaded file's name is directly used when saving the file on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Uploading files: The attack vector involves uploading a malicious file through the `f` parameter of `user/update_profile_pic.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be a registered and authenticated user of the Online Notice Board System.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerable code is located in `profile/i.php` and it shows that the system takes the uploaded file through `$_FILES['f']`, extracts the name and stores it in the `$img` variable. The system uses `move_uploaded_file` function to save the file without proper validation.

```php
extract($_POST);
if(isset($update))
{
$img=$_FILES['f']['name'];
...
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['f']['tmp_name'],"../images/$user/".$_FILES['f']['name']);
}
```
