Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `mm/page_table_check.c` file, which performs checks on page tables. The issue is that not all pages have a `page_ext` structure allocated. Specifically, ZONE_DEVICE pages directly map PFNs (Physical Frame Numbers) and do not allocate `page_ext`, even if there is a `struct page` associated with them. This is often the case when using `devm_memremap_pages()`. The page table check logic assumed that all valid pages have a `page_ext` structure, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Assumption:** The page table check code incorrectly assumed that all pages had an allocated `page_ext`.
*   **Missing Check:** The code lacked a check to see if `page_ext` existed before attempting to access it.
*   **Kernel Bug Trigger:** When both ZONE_DEVICE and page table checking are enabled, the kernel tries to inject pfn maps on the dax device, triggering a kernel BUG.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash (specifically, a `kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!`). This crash would lead to a denial of service.
*   **System Instability:** Repeated crashes could severely destabilize the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Mapping DAX Memories:** The vulnerability is triggered when mapping DAX (Direct Access) memories with both ZONE_DEVICE and page table checks enabled.
*   **Page Faults:** The crash occurs during the resolution of page faults when the kernel attempts to set Pxx mappings using `set_pxx_at()` for ZONE_DEVICE pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to map DAX memory:** An attacker needs to be in a position to map DAX memory using ZONE_DEVICE and have page table checks enabled in the kernel. This implies a degree of system access or control over memory management.
*   **Trigger page faults:** The attacker needs to trigger a page fault on a DAX memory region to activate the vulnerable code path.

**Summary of Fix:**

The fix implemented in the provided commits addresses the issue by adding a check for the existence of `page_ext` before accessing it in the `page_table_check_clear`, `page_table_check_set`, and `__page_table_check_zero` functions in `mm/page_table_check.c`. If `page_ext` does not exist, the function now returns early, avoiding the kernel bug and the associated crash. The core of the fix is the addition of the following:

```c
if (!page_ext)
    return;
```

This check prevents the code from dereferencing the null `page_ext` pointer.
