- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permission checks in Liferay Portal and DXP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient access control allowing users to modify their own permissions. Specifically, users with the "VIEW" user permission can edit their own permissions via the User and Organizations section of the Control Panel.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker (user) can escalate their privileges by editing their own permissions. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and system functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the "User and Organizations" section of the Control Panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "VIEW" permission.
