The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1521.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access control in the Illumina Local Run Manager (LRM) software. Specifically, LRM does not implement authentication or authorization by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284): The system lacks authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated malicious actor can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept sensitive data.
- The actor can potentially gain unauthorized access and manipulate system data.
- Possible compromise of system integrity and confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (remote exploitation).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a network position to interact with the vulnerable LRM instance.
- No prior authentication or user interaction is needed (unauthenticated access).
- Low attack complexity.
