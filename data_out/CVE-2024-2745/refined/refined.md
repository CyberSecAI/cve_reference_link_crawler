- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Security Console's maintenance mode login page was exposing credentials in the address bar when a login attempt was made before the page had fully loaded. This was due to a failure to properly handle the display of sensitive information during the page loading process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure. Credentials (usernames, passwords, tokens (authX), and database details) were being displayed in the browser's address bar, which is an insecure location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could obtain sensitive data including usernames, passwords, authentication tokens, and database details, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system and its data.
- **Attack vectors:** A user attempting to log in to the Security Console's maintenance mode page before it has fully loaded could expose their credentials. An attacker could observe this information through various means including: direct observation of user, observation of intercepted browser traffic, or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to observe the browser address bar while a user attempts to log in to the vulnerable Security Console page. This could involve an attacker being on the same network as the user, or through other forms of access to the user's network activity.
