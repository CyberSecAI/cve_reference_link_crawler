Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `page` function within the `/goform/frmL7ProtForm` page of Tenda routers F1202 and FH1202.

**Vulnerability Details:**
- The `frmL7ProtForm` function reads a user-provided parameter named `page`.
- This `page` parameter is then passed to the `sprintf` function without any length validation.
- Because of the missing length check, the `sprintf` function can write beyond the bounds of the stack-based buffer `v15`, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the router to crash by sending a crafted `page` parameter that overflows the buffer.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary code on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/frmL7ProtForm` endpoint with a maliciously crafted `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda router. This could be from within the local network or, if the router's management interface is exposed, from the internet.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific payload that causes the buffer overflow within `sprintf`, allowing either a crash or RCE.

**Additional Notes**
- The content provides code PoC demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable firmware versions are mentioned:  F1202V1.0BR\_V1.2.0.20(408) and FH1202\_V1.2.0.19\_EN.
- The vulnerability was reported to CVE & CNVD on 2022-06-29.
