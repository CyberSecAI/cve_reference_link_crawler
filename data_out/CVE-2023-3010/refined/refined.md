**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DOM XSS: The vulnerability allows for the execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they interact with a vulnerable WorldMap panel in Grafana.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: An attacker could potentially steal sensitive data accessible within the user's browser session, such as cookies or other session-related information.
- Addition or modification of data: An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to manipulate the data presented within the Grafana interface or potentially take actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user loading a Grafana dashboard containing a malicious WorldMap panel. The malicious code would then be executed within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to create or modify a Grafana dashboard to include the vulnerable WorldMap panel. This could involve the attacker having some level of access to the Grafana instance.
- The attacker must craft a malicious input for the WorldMap panel, designed to inject and execute JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- The victim must interact with the malicious WorldMap panel within a Grafana dashboard for the XSS to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.1.
