Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6262

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'PFG' shortcode of the "Portfolio Gallery – Image Gallery" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website's content, which is later executed in the victim's browser (DOM-based). The injected script is stored in the database (stored XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in pages using the 'PFG' shortcode.
- **Compromised User Experience:** This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Stealing sensitive information like cookies or user credentials.
  - Modifying website content
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
- The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Shortcode ('PFG'):** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's shortcode functionality, which is used to display portfolio galleries.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via the attributes of the 'PFG' shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor-Level Access or Higher:**  The attacker requires at least contributor-level access to create or modify posts/pages and insert shortcodes, so they can inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Portfolio Gallery – Image Gallery Plugin" up to and including version 1.6.4.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.6.5, which includes a fix to address the lack of output escaping by adding `esc_js` function to sanitize the title attribute in the lightbox.js file.
- The `esc_js` function escapes javascript special characters that could lead to XSS.
