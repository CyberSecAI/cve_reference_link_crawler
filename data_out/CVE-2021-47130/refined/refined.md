{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The nvme target attempts to free scatter-gather lists (SGLs) from the p2p pool even when the pool is empty, leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect resource management in the nvme target driver when handling peer-to-peer (p2p) memory. Specifically, it attempts to free memory from the p2p pool even when no memory was allocated from that pool.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a kernel crash, causing a denial-of-service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when an NVMe request is made where a p2p device is found, but the p2p pool is empty. This can occur when a p2p capable device is present, but no p2p memory has been allocated to the namespace in the nvmet target.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to make NVMe requests against a target where a p2p capable device is present. This may require the ability to configure the target and to establish p2p capabilities between target and initiator."
