- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "button image" field in the Content Type section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with high privileges such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view a post where the affected button is rendered. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the plugin's settings page as an administrator or equivalent high privilege user. They then modify the "button image" field to include a malicious script. The script is stored in the database and executed when a post with the button is rendered in a user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or equivalent high privilege access to the WordPress site where the WP ULike plugin is installed. The attacker must be able to access the plugin's settings page.
