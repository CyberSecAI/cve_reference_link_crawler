Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `manage_fee.php` file in the Sourcecodester Resort Reservation System (version 1.0) does not properly sanitize the `toview` parameter before using it in a JavaScript context. Specifically, the value of the `toview` parameter is directly inserted into a conditional operation within a JavaScript block, without any encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied input via the `toview` parameter and reflects it back to the user within the HTML output without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
   - Cookie theft
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the web page
   - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
   - Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. By manipulating the `toview` parameter, an attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the URL that will be executed in the victim's browser

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload in the `toview` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the crafted URL. This can be done by social engineering, embedding the URL in a website, or via other methods.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server or any prior access to the web application.
