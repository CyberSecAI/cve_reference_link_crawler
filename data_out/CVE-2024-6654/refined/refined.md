- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A low-privileged user can create a symlink to a specific location which prevents the ESET security product from starting correctly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how the ESET product handles symlinks during startup, allowing a low-privileged user to interfere with the product's functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack leads to a denial-of-service condition, disabling the protection provided by the ESET security product and causing a potential system slowdown.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, exploiting a weakness in the ESET software on the affected macOS system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user logged on to the system, even with low privileges, and have the ability to create symlinks.
