The provided content is related to CVE-2023-40286.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when processing requests to the BMC web interface, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness lies in the web server component of the BMC IPMI firmware, specifically how it handles user input when creating a new user.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a phishing link to a BMC administrator. When the administrator clicks this link while already logged into the BMC Web UI, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in BMC administrator to click a malicious link.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to poison the administrator's browser cookies and local storage. This enables the attacker to create a new user, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control over the system.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, manipulates the browser's cookies and local storage. This manipulation allows the attacker to inject code that creates a new user, effectively bypassing normal authentication controls.

**Affected Products:**

Supermicro BMC in select X11, H11, B11, CMM, M11, and H12 motherboards.

**Remediation:**

The recommended remediation is to update the BMC firmware to the latest version. Additionally, Supermicro advises following the BMC Configuration Best Practices Guide and configuring session timeout as an immediate workaround to reduce the attack surface.
