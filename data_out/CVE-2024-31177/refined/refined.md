- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fluid_msg::of13::TableFeaturePropActions::unpack` routine within the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) libfluid library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target component.
- **Attack vectors**: A network attacker can trigger the vulnerable code by sending malicious network traffic to the affected component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a network position to send crafted network packets to the vulnerable component.
