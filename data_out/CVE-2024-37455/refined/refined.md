- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a privilege escalation issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin has a broken access control that allows low-privileged users to gain higher privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can escalate their privileges from a low privileged account (Contributor) to something with higher privileges. This can lead to taking full control of the website if high privileges are gained.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not mentioned but it can be inferred it involves the plugin's access control mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with Contributor-level privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability.
