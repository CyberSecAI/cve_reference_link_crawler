The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47016.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of timer configuration bits on m68k architecture, specifically the mvme147 and mvme16x platforms. When clearing the timer interrupt flag and counter overflow, the code was also inadvertently clearing the timer 1 configuration bits. This prevented subsequent timer interrupts from being delivered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect bit clearing during interrupt handling.
- Failure to preserve the necessary timer configuration bits when clearing interrupt flags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Timer interrupts are not delivered after the first one.
- System initialization hangs in `calibrate_delay` because the `jiffies` counter is not updated.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability would manifest upon normal operation of the affected systems. There is no specific user interaction or external attack required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would require the ability to run code on the vulnerable m68k systems.
