Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wp_ajax_route_url()` function within the "Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress" WordPress plugin. This function is called via a `nopriv` AJAX action, meaning it can be accessed without any authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of a capability check before executing the `wp_ajax_route_url()` function. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the function.
*   **Direct Function Access:** The `nopriv` AJAX action makes the function directly accessible to any user, bypassing WordPress's access control system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform various actions, including:

*   **Including random templates:** This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information or unexpected behavior.
*   **Injecting malicious web scripts:** This could enable cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially compromising the security of other users.
*   **Executing arbitrary plugin functions:** The `wp_ajax_route_url()` function acts as a dispatcher to call other controller functions within the plugin. Lack of authorization check allows attackers to call these functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who can make HTTP requests to the WordPress site, as no authentication is required.
*   **AJAX Request:** Attackers craft an AJAX request targeting the `wp_ajax_route_url()` function, including specific parameters to trigger vulnerable code paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or specific permissions on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 2.3.8.
*   The patched version is 2.3.9, which introduces a capability check before executing the function, specifically requiring the `edit_posts` capability.
*   The fix also includes capability checks for other admin functionality, such as import/export, help, and settings pages.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on April 21, 2020.
