# Improper Access Control

Moderate

[bergmania](/bergmania)
published
GHSA-hrww-x3fq-xcvh
Aug 20, 2024

## Package

nuget

Umbraco.Cms
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

> 14.0.0

## Patched versions

14.1.2

## Description

### Impact

As authenticated I can access a few unintended endpoints

### Explanation of the vulnerability

Few endpoints in Umbraco Management API was not protected by a specific section. These just required you to be authenticated. Due to the fact that a member is also just authenticated, it was possible to get info from these endpoints using a member token.

### Severity

Moderate

5.4

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-43377
