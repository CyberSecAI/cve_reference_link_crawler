The plugin itself is A+
But the Devs are E-
Also your staff are using rather confusing excuses instead of actively trying to solve the request
The issue is NOT related to either Elementor OR is solved via a shortcode.
That is simply unrelated and unprofessional to make that claim, when a noobie dev like me could find the solution within a few hours.
Please cancel my plan and give me a FULL REFUND as you were UNABLE to assist me to the ONLY request I had as a PAID subscriber.
