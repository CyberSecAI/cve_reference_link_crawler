*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High (C:H) because of the potential for sensitive data exposure.
*   **Integrity Impact:** None (I:N), because the vulnerability is related to information disclosure, not modification.
*   **Availability Impact:** None (A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **URL Modification:** An attacker modifies the URL to download files from unintended locations, implying that the system is not properly validating or sanitizing URL input related to file access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any prior access or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the device via the network.
