The provided content describes a fix for a memory leak vulnerability in the Apple NVMe driver within the Linux kernel. This issue is addressed by commit `b9ecbfa45516182cd062fecd286db7907ba84210` and backported in subsequent commits.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The apple NVMe driver failed to properly call `nvme_uninit_ctrl` after a successful `nvme_init_ctrl` when the allocation of the admin queue failed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Device memory leak: When the driver failed to allocate the admin queue using `blk_mq_alloc_queue`, it would jump to `put_dev`, freeing the device reference, but would not call `nvme_uninit_ctrl`, leading to a leak of the controller device memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated failures to allocate the admin queue due to various reasons, would cause a memory leak, leading to potential exhaustion of resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the driver initialization, specifically the path where `blk_mq_alloc_queue` fails, via a malformed or specific device configuration during probing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to control or influence the device configuration that the driver is using and thus, cause a failure in the allocation of the admin queue. This would require local access to the system or the ability to modify the ACPI table.
