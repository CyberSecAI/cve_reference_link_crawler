- Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, retrieval of confidential information, arbitrary file upload, backdooring the application, and compromising the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack complexity is low.
- An authenticated attacker is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with the application.
- The attacker can have limited privileges.
- The attacker can exploit this issue remotely, since the affected endpoint is exposed over the network.
