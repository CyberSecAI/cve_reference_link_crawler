Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3439:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3439
*   **Affected Product:** Oracle E-Business Suite
*   **Component:** CRM Wireless
*   **Sub-component:** Call Phone Number Page

*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth?:** No, the attacker needs to be authenticated.
*   **CVSS v3.0 Risk:**
    *   Base Score: 8.2
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Required (for access to affected functionality)
    *   User Interaction: Required (to execute the malicious script)
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: High
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies within the "Call Phone Number Page" of the Oracle CRM Wireless component in Oracle E-Business Suite. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information from other users of the system.
*  The scope is changed, meaning the attacker can potentially affect parts of the application beyond the directly vulnerable component
*   The integrity of the data is at risk
*   Confidentiality of user data is at risk.
*   The availability of the application is not directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (HTTP).
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the exploit. A user must load a page with the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the affected Oracle E-Business Suite system.
*   The attacker needs a valid account within the Oracle E-Business Suite system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript code into the "Call Phone Number Page" parameter(s) to be successfully exploited.
* The attacker will need to entice another user to view the malicious page

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3439 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite's CRM Wireless component. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "Call Phone Number Page", potentially stealing sensitive information from other users. This requires the attacker to entice a user to trigger the malicious script, as it is not immediately executed when the page is loaded.
