Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of input validation in `register_case.php` at line 212. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application's database. The injected data is later retrieved and displayed without sanitization in `case_report.php` at lines 77-94.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. User-supplied data is not validated and is directly stored in the database, which is later displayed on a different page (`case_report.php`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database via the `register_case.php` page.
- When a user accesses `case_report.php`, the injected JavaScript will execute within the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying fake content or modifying the page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code via the `register_case.php` page, likely through form inputs related to case registration.
- The injected code is then triggered when the application renders the data in `case_report.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to submit data to the `register_case.php` page. This implies the attacker needs access to the application's user interface that allows case registration.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in as a specific user, since the XSS is persistent once the data is stored in the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes screenshots that pinpoint the vulnerable lines of code and demonstrate a sample payload.
- The vulnerability exists in "SourceCodester Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System 1.0".
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability, not a reflected XSS one.
