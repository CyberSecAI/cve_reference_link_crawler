- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory pointer is exposed within a property of the Ducktape object, which allows direct memory access and manipulation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Direct memory access and manipulation leading to various vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing a user with limited access (single item configuration) to compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation is possible, requiring only access to a single item configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to configure a single item within the Zabbix monitoring system.
