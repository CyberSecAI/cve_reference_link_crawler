Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `Funadmin\addons\curd\app\curd\controller\Table.php` file, specifically within the `list` method. The code directly concatenates the user-supplied `id` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct concatenation of the `id` parameter into the SQL query, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This lack of input sanitization or prepared statements makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, deletion of data, or complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `/curd/table/list` endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any other specific permissions to exploit the vulnerability, as evidenced by the provided `sqlmap` request and the fact that an admin session cookie is being passed in the request, likely from a logged-in admin user. The admin role might be necessary to have access to the vulnerable endpoint itself.

**Additional details:**

- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (POC) using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the exploit. The POC confirms the successful injection of SQL commands.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `list` method of the `Table.php` controller within the `curd` addon of the Funadmin application, specifically version 5.0.2.
- The vulnerability is present in the "Curd One Click Command Mode" plugin.
