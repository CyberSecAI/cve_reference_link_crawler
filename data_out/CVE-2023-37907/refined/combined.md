# MSI installer allows LPE

Moderate

[overheadhunter](/overheadhunter)
published
GHSA-9c9p-c3mg-hpjq
Jul 24, 2023

## Package

Cryptomator-1.9.1-x64.exe
(exe)

## Affected versions

<= 1.9.1

## Patched versions

1.9.2

Cryptomator-1.9.1-x64.msi
(msi)

<=1.9.1

1.9.2

## Description

### Summary

The MSI installer provided on the homepage allows LPE for low privileged users, if allready installed.

### Details

The problem occurs, as the repair function of the MSI is spawning two administratice cmds. If catched, a simple LPE is possible via a very simple breakout.

### PoC

As a low privileged user do the following steps to reproduce.

* Locate the msi installer under `c:\windows\installer\` . The Installer get cached here for almost forever. To easily locate the installer, use either the timestamp or the script from Mandiant: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/msi-search/main/msi_search.ps1>
* Run the located installer with

  `msiexec.exe /fa C:\Windows\Installer\2847d63.msi`
* When the installer runs, note that there are two cmd windows flickering.
* Catch the cmd, by quickly selecting some text
* Spawn a new SYSTEM cmd via: cmd -> properties -> "legacy console mode" Link -> Internet Explorer -> STRG+O -> cmd.exe

[![LPE_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47333109/254923199-c8778899-ef1a-4e16-a4c4-78f7ba6c1556.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47333109/254923199-c8778899-ef1a-4e16-a4c4-78f7ba6c1556.png)

### Impact

Local Elevation of Privileges. On every machine, where the msi installer still can be found. Rolling out the software via SCCM typically also keeps the msi file.

### Notes

Please let me know, if you have any questions here and keep me updated about the progress and if you can replicate this.

I would like to get a CVE assigned for this, if you agree.

Best Regards,
