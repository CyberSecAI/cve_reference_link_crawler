Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the Windows MSI installer of Cryptomator. Specifically, the repair function of the MSI spawns two administrative command prompt (cmd) windows during the repair process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unprotected Administrative Command Prompts:** The MSI installer spawns command prompts with SYSTEM privileges without proper protection or restrictions.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization or Security Checks**: The spawned cmd prompts did not prevent the injection of further commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can perform any action on the system, including installing malware, accessing sensitive data, and modifying system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Locate Cached MSI Installer:** The attacker needs to find the cached MSI installer of the vulnerable Cryptomator version (<= 1.9.1) typically located in `c:\windows\installer\`.
2.  **Initiate MSI Repair:** The attacker runs the installer with the `/fa` (force repair) option via the command: `msiexec.exe /fa C:\Windows\Installer\2847d63.msi` (where the MSI path may vary).
3.  **Catch the cmd window:** Quickly select text within the flickering cmd windows to pause it.
4.  **Exploit cmd Window:** Use the command prompt properties to launch a new SYSTEM cmd via the legacy console mode, and "internet explorer" link to spawn a new cmd.exe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to a Windows system where the vulnerable version of Cryptomator was previously installed and the MSI installer is cached.
*   **Low Privilege Account:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a low-privilege user account.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker must have some technical skills to execute commands in a cmd window, locate the cached installer, and perform the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by PfiatDe.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Cryptomator version 1.9.2.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-37907.
*   The weakness is associated with CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
* The advisory mentions that rolling out the software via SCCM could also leave the MSI file available to be exploited.
