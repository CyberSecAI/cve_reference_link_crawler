# WordPress 6.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

**Note: Due to an issue with the initial package, WordPress 6.5.1 was not released. 6.5.2 is the first minor release for WordPress 6.5.**

This security and maintenance release features [2 bug fixes on Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&id=!60398&milestone=6.5.2&group=status&order=priority), [12 bug fixes for the Block Editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/60577), and 1 security fix.

**Because this is a security release, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.** Backports are also available for other major WordPress releases, 6.0 and later.

You can [download WordPress 6.5.2 from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.5.2.zip), or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”. If you have sites that support automatic background updates, the update process will begin automatically.

WordPress 6.5.2 is a short-cycle release. The next major release will be [version 6.6](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-6/) and is currently planned for 16 July 2024.

## Security updates included in this release

The security team would like to thank the following people for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities, and allowing them to be fixed in this release:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Avatar block type; reported by [John Blackbourn](https://johnblackbourn.com/) of the WordPress security team. Many thanks to [Mat Rollings](https://twitter.com/stealthcopter) for assisting with the research.

## Thank you to these WordPress contributors

This release was led by [John Blackbourn](https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/), [Isabel Brison](https://profiles.wordpress.org/isabel_brison/), and [Aaron Jorbin](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/).
