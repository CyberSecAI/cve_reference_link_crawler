* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2841

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: Mail may load remote audio and video content when remote image loading is disabled

  Description: When WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element pointing to an external resource, it does not issue a resource load callback to determine if the resource should be loaded. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. As an example, the sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine that the message was read. This issue is addressed by generating resource load callbacks when WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element.
