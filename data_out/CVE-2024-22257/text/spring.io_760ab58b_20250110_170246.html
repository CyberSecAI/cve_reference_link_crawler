# CVE-2024-22257: Possible Broken Access Control in Spring Security With Direct Use of AuthenticatedVoter

HIGH | MARCH 18, 2024 | CVE-2024-22257
# Description

In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.12, 5.8.x prior to 5.8.11, versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.9, versions 6.1.x prior to 6.1.8, versions 6.2.x prior to 6.2.3, an application is possible vulnerable to broken access control when it directly uses the `AuthenticatedVoter#vote` passing a `null` Authentication parameter.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable if:

* The application uses `AuthenticatedVoter` directly and a `null` authentication parameter is passed to it resulting in an erroneous `true` return value.

An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

* The application does not use `AuthenticatedVoter#vote` directly.
* The application does not pass `null` to `AuthenticatedVoter#vote`.

Note that `AuthenticatedVoter` is deprecated since 5.8, use implementations of `AuthorizationManager` as a replacement.
