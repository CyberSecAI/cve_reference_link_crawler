# CVE-2024-42915: Host Header Injection in Forgot Password of APSIT Staff Appraisal System

A host header injection vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of APSIT Staff Appraisal System. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords.

PoC:

* We trigger the forgot password functionality for an existing user, such as `staff1@email.com`, and provide a malicious host header: `Host: attacker-controlled.com`.
* This sends a password reset email to `staff1@email.com` that contains the following:

```
You are receiving this because you (or someone else) have requested the reset of the password for your account.
Please click on the following link, or paste this into your browser to complete the process:
http://attacker-controlled.com/forgot/reset/faculty/<token>
If you did not request this, please ignore this email and your password will remain unchanged.

```

* Note the host being `attacker-controlled.com`.
* When `staff1` clicks the link and attempts to use the password reset token, the token is leaked to the attacker which would allow resetting `staff1's` password and taking over his account.

Discovered by Sourajeet Majumder, August 2024.

# Staff Appraisal System

## Description

**Staff Appraisal System** is an open source application. With a growing list of installable modules, the **appraisal system** allows faculty to self assess themselfs and give their report to the higher authority in this case it will be the **HoD**. Super user **Manager** can create and view all the users like HoD and Faculties. Manager have access to a graphical representation of faculties showing progress over the years. **Staff appraisal system** is built by:

* **Debashish Choudhury** (<http://github.com/deb1398>)
* **Utkarsh Naik** (<https://github.com/utkarsh17naik>)
* **Anagha Devade** (<https://github.com/adevade16>)

Under the guidance of:

* **Anagha Aher**
* **Vishal Badgujar** (<https://github.com/vishal003>)

Staff Appraisal System focuses on a modular plugin system and uses NodeJs for server side script, Hbs tamplate engine along with MongoDB to store data.

## Installation

#### Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version.
2. Clone the repository and check out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/deb1398/staff-appraisal-system`
3. Enter the repository: `cd staff-appraisal-system/`
4. Install and run the app with: `npm install && npm start`

   For **Server Only** use: `npm install && node serveronly` .

**Important:** Make sure to add .env file in the root of the application. Make sure that you whitelist the interface/ip (`ipWhitelist`) in the server config where you have created the mongodb collection, otherwise it will not be allowed to connect to the server. You also need to set the local host `address` field to `0.0.0.0` in order to make it open for all the ports.

**Important:** Changes that need to be done in .env file is as shown below:

```
HOST = 5000 // or enter your own port
PASSWD = // Enter the password of your organizations gmail account.
DBPASS = // Enter your mongodb user password

```

PASSWD is required for password reset. A mail will be sent to user for password reset link. This mail will be sent by the Organization's email id, hence password is required.

## IEEE Paper Publications

### 1) IEEE ic-ETITE, VIT Vellore.

First paper was selected in **International Conference on Emerging Trends in
Information Technology and Engineering, VIT Vellore** of the topic *Study on Feasibility of Uniform Appraisal System*. Here is the link of the paper published:
<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9077847>

### 2) IEEE ICACCS, Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, Coimbatore.

Second paper was selected in **6th International Conference on
Advanced Computing and Communication Systems, Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, Coimbatore** of the topic *Study on Semi Automation in Uniform Faculty Appraisal System*. Here is the link of the paper published:
<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9074383>

## Configuration

### General

If you want to update your Appraisal System to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your BEIT-PROJECT\_04\_Staff-Appraisal-System folder and type the following command:

```
git pull && npm install
```

If you changed nothing more than the config or the modules, this should work without any problems.
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.

## Contributing Guidelines

Contributions of all kinds are welcome, not only in the form of code but also with regards bug reports and documentation.

Please keep the following in mind:

* **Bug Reports**: Make sure you're running the latest version. If the issue(s) still persist: please open a clearly documented issue with a clear title.
* **Minor Bug Fixes**: Please send a pull request with a clear explanation of the issue or a link to the issue it solves.
* **Major Bug Fixes**: please discuss your approach in an GitHub issue before you start to alter a big part of the code.
* **New Features**: please please discuss in a GitHub issue before you start to alter a big part of the code. Without discussion upfront, the pull request will not be accepted / merged.

Thanks for your help in making Staff Appraisal System better!
