Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `task_id` parameter within the `edit-task.php` file of the SourceCodester PHP Task Management System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `task_id` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:**  Important user and system data can be leaked by exploiting the SQL injection.
- **Compromised System Security:** The vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of system security, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted `task_id` parameter in the URL when accessing the `edit-task.php` file.
- **Payload Example:** The provided payload `task_id=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(10),0))XOR'Z` demonstrates an example of how the injection can be performed. This particular payload uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique by inserting a sleep command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** An understanding of how to send HTTP GET requests and manipulate URL parameters.
- **SQL Knowledge:**  Basic knowledge of SQL syntax and injection techniques is necessary to craft effective payloads.
