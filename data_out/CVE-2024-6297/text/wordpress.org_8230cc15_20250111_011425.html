  The WordPress.org Plugin Review Team was notified that a malicious actor had taken over Social Sharing Plugin – Social Warfare. As a result, versions 4.4.6.4 to 4.4.7.1 of the plugin [created users](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/social-warfare/tags/4.4.6.4/trunk/social-warfare.php#L54) with administrative privileges.

  The Plugin Review Team has disabled it and released a “clean” updated version: **4.4.7.3. Please update immediately**.

  If you have used versions 4.4.6.4 to 4.4.7.1 of the Social Warfare plugin, we strongly recommend you do an in-depth review of your site’s activity and user account details.

  I am having vulnerability issues / created users with administrative privileges with 4.4.8, so it would appear this issue hasn’t been resolved.

  The issue should be patched by updating to 4.4.7.3.

  [@sarahsbakestudio](https://wordpress.org/support/users/sarahsbakestudio/), are you 100% sure these new users were not added (and possibly edited manually by the attacker) prior to the update?

  I am absolutely certain that the new user didn’t show up until AFTER I already had the patched update. Jetpack has been telling me that SW has vulnerabilities for the last month and I have been contacting SW weekly in regards to it, so I’ve been very watchful of new unauthorized users. The only way I can get rid of the user is by getting rid of SW.

  I could be wrong about this, but I was also under the impression that if I had unauthorized users with versions 4.4.6.4 to 4.4.7.1 (which I did not), that the updated version would have gotten rid of them AND stop future vulnerabilities.
