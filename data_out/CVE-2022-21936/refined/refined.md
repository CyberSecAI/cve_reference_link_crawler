The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-21936.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication. The affected software does not properly validate user identity claims.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system insufficiently validates user identity claims, allowing an Active Directory user to execute validated actions without a valid password.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an Active Directory user to execute validated actions without providing a valid password. This could lead to unauthorized access and control within the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and has low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires network access to the affected system and a valid Active Directory user account. They do not need a valid password for that account to exploit the vulnerability.
