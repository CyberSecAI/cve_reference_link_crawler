- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected software does not properly validate user identity claims, which is categorized as an Improper Authentication issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287). The software insufficiently validates user identity claims.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an Active Directory user to execute validated actions without providing a valid password. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the system and its functions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, with a low attack complexity, meaning that an attacker could exploit this over a network with relative ease.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an Active Directory user with network access to the affected system.
