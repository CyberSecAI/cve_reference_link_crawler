Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks in the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. Specifically, there were insufficient restrictions on who could add a registration form and set a custom registration role when using the Elementor page builder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is that the plugin does not properly verify user capabilities before allowing them to add a registration form and specify a user role. This allows users with lower privileges (Contributor+) to potentially create a registration form and set the default role to "administrator."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with Contributor or higher access can exploit this flaw to gain administrative access to the WordPress site. By creating a registration form with the administrator role, they can register a new account with full privileges. This would allow them to take full control over the website, potentially causing significant damage, data loss or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploitable via the web interface. An attacker needs access to the WordPress admin dashboard with the ability to use the Elementor page builder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with "Contributor" role or higher. This user must also be able to access the Elementor page builder. This means they must be a logged-in user to the site.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided changelog indicates that version 4.6.5 of the plugin addresses the "Security Enhancement" related to "AJAX requests", and a vulnerability that allows privilege escalation was publicly disclosed on May 5, 2021 by Wordfence.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.6.5 of the plugin
