- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Import Users from CSV plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, leading to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and more if a proper POP chain is present.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrator privileges.
