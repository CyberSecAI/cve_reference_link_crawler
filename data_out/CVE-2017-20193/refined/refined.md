Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-20193

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `vendor_description` parameter within the Product Vendors plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the 'vendor\_description' parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user clicks a malicious link, the injected script will execute within the user's browser session.
*   This can lead to session hijacking, potentially granting the attacker control of the user's account, including administrator privileges if the user is an administrator.
*   While the XSS is reflected and not persistent, it allows attackers to target visitors and potentially gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `vendor_description` parameter.
*   Attackers could distribute this URL via email or other means, tricking users into clicking on it.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user, who is already logged into the WordPress site, to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerable plugin is Product Vendors for WooCommerce, versions up to and including 2.0.35.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher at Wordfence and responsibly disclosed to Automattic.
*   The issue was patched in version 2.0.36 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability exists in a field on the sign-up form available for new vendors through the plugin.
