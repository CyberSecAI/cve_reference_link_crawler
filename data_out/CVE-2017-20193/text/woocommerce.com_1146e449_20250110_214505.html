## Turn your store into a multi-vendor marketplace

Do you have an existing site and loyal community and would like to find ways to **diversify your revenue**? Or would you like to start an eCommerce business without investing in creating your product line? With **Product Vendors for WooCommerce** you can **instantly** turn a Woo store into a marketplace with multiple vendors, products and payout settings.

Allow multiple vendors to sell via your site and, in return, take a commission on sales to cover the costs of managing the site while you focus your efforts on building a community.
