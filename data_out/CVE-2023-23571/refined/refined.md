- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer over-read occurs in the `eventcore` binary when handling network requests. The `recv_data_thread` function receives data into a buffer named `chunk_buff` and then appends it to a `message` buffer. The `memcpy` operation attempts to copy more data from `chunk_buff` than is available, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer over-read (CWE-126) vulnerability exists in the `memcpy` operation within the `recv_data_thread` function. The function receives at most 0x1ff bytes into `chunk_buff`, but copies `0x800 - message_strlen` bytes from it, which can exceed the buffer's bounds, especially during the first `memcpy` operation, where it copies 0x800 bytes.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, the over-read causes a segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`), leading to a crash of the `eventcore` binary. Since this binary is responsible for performing actions after an event occurs, crashing it will prevent the router from performing those actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network request to the Milesight UR32L router on UDP port 9001.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the vulnerable device's IP address on port 9001. No authentication or prior privileges are required.
