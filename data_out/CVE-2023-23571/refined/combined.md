# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1696

## Milesight UR32L eventcore access violation vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-23571

##### SUMMARY

An access violation vulnerability exists in the eventcore functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted network request can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-126 - Buffer Over-read

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The router can be set up to trigger an action after a particular event occurs. For instance, it is possible to send an e-mail or an SMS after a device reboots. Other actions and events exist. The binary that actually performs the action, after a particular event occurs, is `eventcore`.

The `eventcore` binary has a thread that waits for data that seems to be used to query the SQLite3 database used to archive the various event-related information.
Following the `recv_data_thread` function that manages the reception of the data:

```
undefined4 recv_data_thread(int *socket)

{
 [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  memset(chunk_buff + 4,0,0x1fc);
  [... variable initialization ...]

  if (socket == (int *)0x0) {
    syslog(3,"param is null\n");
  }
  else {
    socket_ = *socket;
    if (socket_ < 1) {
      syslog(3,"udp fd less than 0.\n");
    }
    else {
      message = (char *)malloc_and_memset(0x800);
      if (message != (char *)0x0) {
        memset(message,0,0x800);
        do {
          while( true ) {
            memset(chunk_buff,0,0x200);
            message_strlen = strlen(message);
            recv_length = recv_wrap(socket_,chunk_buff,0x1ff,&src_addr);                                [1]
            if ((chunk_buff[0] == '\0') || (recv_length != 0x1ff)) break;
            memcpy(message + message_strlen,chunk_buff,0x800 - message_strlen);                         [2]
          }
          [...]
        }
      }
      [...]
}

```

The function executes a loop where it received at most 0x1ff bytes into the `chunk_buff` buffer, then the content of the `chunk_buff` is appended into the `message` buffer.

The `chunk_buff` buffer is correctly sized with 512 bytes available, so the read at `[1]` is correct. At `[2]` the `memcpy` copies the size `0x800 - message_strlen` from `chunk_buff` into `message`. So, the first `memcpy` will copy 0x800 bytes from a buffer of 0x1ff bytes. This leads to a buffer over-read. Furthermore, the thread starts with a fresh stack, which implies that the stack buffer `chunk_buff` is close to end of the stack and a buffer over-read will cause a SIGSEGV.

Debugging the process, it is easy to understand this problem:

```
memcpy@plt (
    $r0 = 0x00043730 → 0x00000000,
    $r1 = 0x76de4b0c → "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]",
    $r2 = 0x00000800,
)  The `$r2` register contains the address of the `chunk_buff` buffer; in this case, it is  `0x76de4b0c`. Following the thread stack region and the region adjacent:

0x76bf0000 0x76de5000 0x00000000 rw-
0x76de5000 0x76de6000 0x00000000 ---

```

The bytes between `chunk_buff`, at `0x76de4b0c`, and the end of thread’s stack region, at `0x76de5000`, is 0x4f4 bytes. So, reading 0x800 bytes from `chunk_buff` implies it will try to access outside the stack region.

The router can be set up to trigger an action after a particular event occurs. For instance, it is possible to send an e-mail or an SMS after a device reboots. Other actions and events exist. The binary that actually performs the action, after a particular event occurs, is `eventcore`.

The `eventcore` binary has a thread that waits for data that seems to be used to query the SQLite3 database used to archive the various event-related information.
Following the `recv_data_thread` function that manages the reception of the data:

```
undefined4 recv_data_thread(int *socket)

{
 [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  memset(chunk_buff + 4,0,0x1fc);
  [... variable initialization ...]

  if (socket == (int *)0x0) {
    syslog(3,"param is null\n");
  }
  else {
    socket_ = *socket;
    if (socket_ < 1) {
      syslog(3,"udp fd less than 0.\n");
    }
    else {
      message = (char *)malloc_and_memset(0x800);
      if (message != (char *)0x0) {
        memset(message,0,0x800);
        do {
          while( true ) {
            memset(chunk_buff,0,0x200);
            message_strlen = strlen(message);
            recv_length = recv_wrap(socket_,chunk_buff,0x1ff,&src_addr);                                [1]
            if ((chunk_buff[0] == '\0') || (recv_length != 0x1ff)) break;
            memcpy(message + message_strlen,chunk_buff,0x800 - message_strlen);                         [2]
          }
          [...]
        }
      }
      [...]
}

```

The function executes a loop where it received at most 0x1ff bytes into the `chunk_buff` buffer, then the content of the `chunk_buff` is appended into the `message` buffer.

The `chunk_buff` buffer is correctly sized with 512 bytes available, so the read at `[1]` is correct. At `[2]` the `memcpy` copies the size `0x800 - message_strlen` from `chunk_buff` into `message`. So, the first `memcpy` will copy 0x800 bytes from a buffer of 0x1ff bytes. This leads to a buffer over-read. Furthermore, the thread starts with a fresh stack, which implies that the stack buffer `chunk_buff` is close to end of the stack and a buffer over-read will cause a SIGSEGV.

Debugging the process, it is easy to understand this problem:

```
memcpy@plt (
    $r0 = 0x00043730 → 0x00000000,
    $r1 = 0x76de4b0c → "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]",
    $r2 = 0x00000800,
)  The `$r2` register contains the address of the `chunk_buff` buffer; in this case, it is  `0x76de4b0c`. Following the thread stack region and the region adjacent:

0x76bf0000 0x76de5000 0x00000000 rw-
0x76de5000 0x76de6000 0x00000000 ---

```

The bytes between `chunk_buff`, at `0x76de4b0c`, and the end of thread’s stack region, at `0x76de5000`, is 0x4f4 bytes. So, reading 0x800 bytes from `chunk_buff` implies it will try to access outside the stack region.
