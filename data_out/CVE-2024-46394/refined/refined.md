The provided content is relevant to a potential vulnerability in FrogCMS V0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `/admin/?/user/add` component of FrogCMS V0.9.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add a new administrator user to the system.
- By successfully adding an admin user the attacker gains administrative access to the target system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to `/admin/?/user/add`.
- The victim, who is logged into FrogCMS, is tricked into visiting this page.
- The victim's browser automatically sends the malicious request, creating a new user without their knowledge or consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver the malicious HTML page to the victim.
- The victim must be logged into FrogCMS for the attack to succeed.
