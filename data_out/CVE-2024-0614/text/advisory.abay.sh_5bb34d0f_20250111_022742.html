# CVE-2024-0614 — Events Manager <= 6.4.6.4 Administrator+ Stored Cross-Site Scritpting via Settings

  Feb 28, 2024   Feb 28, 2024  abay

The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

### Proof of Concepts

2. Under Privacy tab, input XSS Payload in Consent Text form `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>I consent to my submitted data being collected and stored as outlined by the site %s.`
3. Create new event and check “Enable registration for this event”

XSS Payload will triggered on Event Page

### Impact
