### Description

The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

  Feb 28, 2024   Feb 28, 2024  abay

The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.

### Proof of Concepts

1. Go to plugin’s setting page `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=event&page=events-manager-options#general`
2. Under Privacy tab, input XSS Payload in Consent Text form `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>I consent to my submitted data being collected and stored as outlined by the site %s.`
3. Create new event and check “Enable registration for this event”

XSS Payload will triggered on Event Page

### Impact

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
