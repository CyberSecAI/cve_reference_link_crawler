### @fredericdalleau **[fredericdalleau](/fredericdalleau)** commented [Jun 24, 2021](#issue-929420326)

This series add some fixes for various cases that have been reported that allow the guest to trigger a crash of the virtual machine.

The first two are NULL pointer dereference and are already handled in bhyve.

<https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/usr.sbin/bhyve/virtio.c#n606>

<https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/usr.sbin/bhyve/virtio.c#n725>

The other two are unhandled returned errors in vq\_getchain. For now, trace and return as in pci\_vt9p\_notify.

Let me know what you think.

Sorry, something went wrong.
