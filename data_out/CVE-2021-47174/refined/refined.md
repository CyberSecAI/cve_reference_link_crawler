- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `nft_pipapo_avx2_lookup()` function was using FPU instructions without checking if the FPU was usable in the current context. This led to a crash when the function was called from a softirq that interrupted a kthread also using the FPU.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing check for FPU availability using `irq_fpu_usable()` before using FPU instructions.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Kernel crash, leading to denial of service.

- **Attack vectors:** Triggering a network traffic pattern that causes the `nft_pipapo_avx2_lookup()` function to be executed in a softirq context while a kthread is using the FPU.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send network packets that would cause the vulnerable code path to be executed.
