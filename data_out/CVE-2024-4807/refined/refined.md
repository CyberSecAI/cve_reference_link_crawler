Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `delete_user.php` file of the Kashipara College Management System.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter used in the `delete_user.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker could potentially leak sensitive user data or system information.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can compromise the security of the system by gaining unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Complete control:** With a successful SQLi an attacker can gain access to modify, delete, and create information on the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `delete_user.php` file.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The injection point is the `id` parameter in the URL or request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQLi:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQLi payload
*   **No authentication required:** The provided information does not mention authentication as a requirement, indicating that the attack can be performed without prior authentication.

**Additional Information**
*   The provided payload `id=(select(0)from(select(sleep(8)))v)` uses a time-based SQL injection technique to test the vulnerability by introducing a delay, which can be observed.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `delete_user.php` file of Kashipara College Management System that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands through a crafted `id` parameter, leading to potential data leakage and system compromise.
