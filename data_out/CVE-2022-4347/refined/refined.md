- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `WebUtils.java` file in xiandafu beetl-bbs does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controlled input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page. Specifically, the manipulation of the `user` argument with an unknown input leads to the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can affect integrity of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `user` argument in `WebUtils.java`. The attack is remote, and the victim needs to interact with the manipulated output.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `user` argument.
