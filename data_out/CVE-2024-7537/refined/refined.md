- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing SMS message lists in oFono.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which can lead to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can disclose sensitive information by triggering a read past the end of an allocated buffer. The attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the affected system. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
