A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC Traffic Analyzer (6GK8822-1BG01-0BA0) (All versions < V2.0). The affected application mounts the container's root filesystem with read and write privileges. This could allow an attacker to alter the container's filesystem leading to unauthorized modifications and data corruption.
