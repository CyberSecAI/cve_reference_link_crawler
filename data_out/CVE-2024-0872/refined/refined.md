Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0872

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `watu-userinfo` shortcode in the Watu Quiz plugin. This shortcode allows retrieval of user profile fields. The vulnerability exists because the shortcode didn't properly sanitize the user meta data before displaying it, leading to sensitive information exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The plugin exposes sensitive user meta data (including session tokens and user emails). This data can be retrieved by an authorized user utilizing the `watu-userinfo` shortcode.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Although the attacker must be authenticated, the vulnerability allows users with contributor-level access or higher to access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive user data like session tokens and emails by exploiting the vulnerability. This could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Abuse:** Attackers leverage the `watu-userinfo` shortcode to extract user meta data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
- **Access to Content Editor:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify content where shortcodes can be inserted (e.g., posts or pages).
- **No special skill required:** The attacker needs to be able to insert the `watu-userinfo` shortcode, which is a basic task in WordPress.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved disabling the `watu-userinfo` shortcode.
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.4.1.
- The patched version is 3.4.1.1.
- The `watu-userinfo` shortcode was removed in version 3.4.1.1 of the plugin, effectively fixing the issue.
- The code diff shows that the `userinfo` function within the `shortcodes.php` file was modified to always return an empty string (`return '';`), disabling the vulnerable functionality.
