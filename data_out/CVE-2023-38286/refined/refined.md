{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the use of Thymeleaf for HTML rendering in Spring Boot Admin. Thymeleaf has a sandbox bypass vulnerability that, when exploited with a malicious HTML template, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Additionally, the ability to modify the MailNotifier template via the actuator endpoint allows loading of malicious HTML from a remote server or local files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Thymeleaf",
      "Insecure use of reflection in the template engine",
      "Lack of input validation on MailNotifier template configuration",
      "Exposed actuator endpoints allowing modification of application behavior"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running Spring Boot Admin, or arbitrary file reading. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system and sensitive data exposure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending POST requests to the `/actuator/env` endpoint to enable MailNotifier and set a malicious template URL.",
      "Sending POST requests to `/actuator/refresh` to apply the changes.",
       "Sending POST request to `/instances` to trigger notification."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the `/actuator/env` and `/actuator/refresh` endpoints of a Spring Boot Admin instance. They also need a web server to host the malicious HTML file. Write access to the `/env` endpoint is necessary to exploit the vulnerability, and the attacker needs to know the location of the HTML template.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Spring Boot Admin Server",
        "Thymeleaf Template Engine",
        "MailNotifier",
        "Actuator Endpoints"
      ],
       "poc": "The provided document includes multiple proof-of-concept (POC) HTML templates that demonstrate how to leverage Thymeleaf's sandbox bypass to achieve RCE. The steps to reproduce the vulnerability using these POCs, including how to enable MailNotifier, set the malicious template URL, trigger a notification, and perform arbitrary file read, are described."
