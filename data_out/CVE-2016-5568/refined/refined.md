Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) component of Oracle Java SE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The AWT component is susceptible to a security flaw that can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system running the vulnerable Java version. This may lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable through network access.  It's triggered by loading and running untrusted code, such as a Java applet or Java Web Start application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to get the user to run a malicious Java applet or Web Start application. This could be through social engineering (convincing the user to click a link) or by hosting a malicious page on a website that the user visits.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is applicable to Java deployments, typically clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code and rely on the Java sandbox for security.
*   The vulnerability does *not* apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
*   The CVSS score assumes that the user has administrator privileges (which is typical in Windows). When this is not the case the impact scores are lower.
*   The vulnerability is found in Oracle Java SE versions 6u121, 7u111, and 8u102.  It's also present in Java SE Embedded 8u101.
*   Multiple vendors acknowledge this CVE and its impact on their products.

This information goes into more detail than the standard CVE description by specifying the vulnerable component (AWT), the vector of attack (untrusted code via applets or Web Start), and the contextual information that impacts the severity score.
