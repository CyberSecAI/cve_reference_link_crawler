The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47382.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missed error path in the `qeth_do_reset` function within the s390/qeth driver.
-  Specifically, when a qeth channel path is configured offline, a race condition can occur between `qeth_do_reset` and `ccwgroup_remove`.
- The `qeth_do_reset` function, in its error handling path, was still taking the `discipline_mutex` which could lead to a deadlock situation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Deadlock:**  The core issue is a potential deadlock. This happens because of the incorrect locking order, where `discipline_mutex` was taken in the error path of `qeth_do_reset` leading to a deadlock when this function races with the `ccwgroup_remove` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a system deadlock. This can lead to denial of service as the system will be unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves configuring a qeth channel path offline. This triggers the race condition between `qeth_do_reset` and `ccwgroup_remove`, leading to the deadlock.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would require the ability to configure qeth channel paths and trigger an error condition which would cause qeth_do_reset to be called. This would typically require root or administrative privileges.

**Summary of the fix:**

The fix involves the following changes:
1.  **`ccwgroup_set_offline` Modification:** The `ccwgroup_set_offline` function was modified to accept a boolean parameter `call_gdrv`. This allows calling the registered `gdrv->set_offline` only when needed.
2.  **Error path adjustment:** The `qeth_do_reset` function was modified to, upon error, call `qeth_set_offline()` first, and then `ccwgroup_set_offline()` with the `call_gdrv` flag set to `false`, thus avoiding the `discipline_mutex` in the error case.
