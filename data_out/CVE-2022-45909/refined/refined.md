Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-45909

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read.
- It occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a long Request-URI in an INVITE request. Specifically, the code uses a fixed-size buffer of 255 bytes to copy the Request-URI, but does not check if the URI exceeds this length, leading to a buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**:  The code reads beyond the allocated buffer when handling a long Request-URI, due to the use of `strncpy` with a fixed-size buffer.
- Inadequate input validation: The code does not validate the length of the Request-URI before copying it to a fixed-size buffer, leading to the over-read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Critical Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.1.
- **Confidentiality Impact: High:** An attacker may potentially read sensitive information from the heap memory.
- **Availability Impact: High:** The over-read can lead to a crash of the application, causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- An attacker can send a specially crafted INVITE request with a long Request-URI that exceeds the buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges or user interaction is required for exploitation.
- An attacker only needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in `drachtio-server` version 0.8.18.
- The fix involves increasing the buffer size for the Request-URI to `MAX_SIP_URI_LEN` (1024), which was done in commit `a63d018`. This also included an additional check on the length of the URI.

- The vulnerable code snippet was in the `normalizeSipUri` function in `drachtio.cpp`, where a fixed-size buffer was used with `strncpy`:
```c++
char buf[255]; // vulnerable code
s = strncpy( buf, uri.c_str(), 255 ) ; // vulnerable code

char buf[MAX_SIP_URI_LEN]; // fixed code
s = strncpy( buf, uri.c_str(), MAX_SIP_URI_LEN ) ; // fixed code
```

- The code was also updated in the function `replaceHostInUri` using the same method as above.
- The issue was reported and fixed in pull request #238.
