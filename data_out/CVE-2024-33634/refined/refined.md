Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The Piotnet Addons For Elementor Pro Plugin (versions <= 7.1.17) allows a malicious actor to cause the website to make requests to an arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker.

**Weaknesses:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input that is used in making server-side requests, allowing for the manipulation of the request target.

**Impact:**
*   A malicious actor could make requests to internal services or other services running on the same network as the WordPress installation, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
*   The attacker could also use the vulnerable website as a proxy to scan ports or interact with internal infrastructure.
*   This could expose sensitive data of other services running on the system.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack is done through manipulating user-provided input that controls the destination of server-side requests made by the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, suggesting the vulnerable functionality is exposed to unauthenticated users.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin in some way in order to trigger the SSRF vulnerability.
