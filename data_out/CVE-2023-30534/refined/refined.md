Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-30534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `unserialize()` function in PHP without proper sanitization of user-controlled input. This occurs in two distinct locations within the Cacti application:
    *   `graphs_new.php` within the `host_new_graphs_save` function, where the `selected_graphs_array` parameter is unserialized.
    *   `managers.php` within the `form_actions` function, when `action_receiver_notifications` is set, the `selected_items` parameter is unserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is insecure deserialization, where user-provided serialized PHP objects are directly passed to the `unserialize()` function. This allows an attacker to potentially control the structure and content of the object being deserialized.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data before passing it to `unserialize()`, allowing for arbitrary serialized objects to be processed.
*   **Bypass of "Safe Deserialization":** Cacti has a "safe" deserialization function, but it is not used in these vulnerable locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** Although the article states that exploitation is not possible in a standard installation, insecure deserialization *can* lead to remote code execution if a suitable "gadget chain" is available. This involves using specially crafted serialized objects that trigger a series of actions within the application to achieve arbitrary code execution. The provided texts note that the Cacti vendor directory has a gadget chain through PHPSecLib, but it is unusable because Cacti does not include the necessary files in its standard installation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even without achieving remote code execution, an attacker could potentially disrupt the application's operation by supplying malicious serialized data that causes errors or crashes during deserialization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerable code is reachable via HTTP POST requests.
*   **Manipulated POST Parameters:** Attackers can inject malicious serialized PHP objects into the `selected_graphs_array` parameter in `graphs_new.php` and the `selected_items` parameter in `managers.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Cacti application.
*   **Knowledge of PHP serialization:** The attacker needs to be able to create a serialized PHP object.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cacti versions prior to 1.2.25 and has been fixed in versions 1.2.25 and 1.3.0.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity because, while the insecure deserialization exists, a viable gadget chain is not available by default to make it directly exploitable for RCE.
*   A Nuclei template has been created to help detect this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`. This indicates a network-based attack, with low complexity, requiring low privileges, no user interaction, with a potential for low impact on confidentiality but no impact on integrity or availability.
