# Insecure deserialization of filter data

Moderate

[netniV](/netniV)
published
GHSA-77rf-774j-6h3p
Sep 5, 2023

## Package

Cacti
(PHP)

## Affected versions

< 1.2.25

## Patched versions

1.2.25, 1.3.0

## Description

### Summary

There are two instances of insecure deserialization in Cacti version 1.2.24. While a viable gadget chain exists in Cacti’s vendor directory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included, making them inaccessible and the insecure deserializations not exploitable.

### Details

Each instance of insecure deserialization is due to using the unserialize function without sanitizing the user input. Cacti has a “safe” deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and check for specific values before calling unserialize, but it isn’t used in these instances.

#### In graphs\_new.php

The vulnerable code lies in graphs\_new.php, specifically within the host\_new\_graphs\_save function. The following code is taken from the beginning of the function in Cacti 1.2.10:

```
function host_new_graphs_save($host_id) {
        $selected_graphs_array = unserialize(stripslashes(get_nfilter_request_var('selected_graphs_array')));
        $values = array();

```

This function unserializes the user controlled parameter ‘selected\_graphs\_array’. While stripslashes is run first, this simply removes extra slashes that are needed in strings during pre-processing (e.g. &rdquo; to “). In order to reach this function, the user makes a request to graphs\_new with two parameters: action=save and save\_component\_new\_graphs, which causes the vulnerable function to be called, as shown in the two code snippets below:

```
switch (get_request_var('action')) {
        case 'save':
            form_save();
            break;
        case 'query_reload':
            ...
        ...
        ...
function form_save() {
	...
        ...
	...
	if (isset_request_var('save_component_new_graphs')) {
		host_new_graphs_save(get_filter_request_var('host_id'));

		header('Location: graphs_new.php?host_id=' . get_filter_request_var('host_id') . &header=false');
	}
}

```
#### In managers.php

The vulnerable code lies in managers.php, specifically within the form\_actions function. The following code is extracted from the function in Cacti 1.2.10:

```
function form_actions() {
	global $manager_actions, $manager_notification_actions;

	if (isset_request_var('selected_items')) {
		if (isset_request_var('action_receivers')) {
			...
			...
			...
		} elseif (isset_request_var('action_receiver_notifications')) {
			get_filter_request_var('id');
			$selected_items = unserialize(stripslashes(get_nfilter_request_var('selected_items')));
			...
		}
	...
}

```

By setting the request variable action\_receiver\_notifications, we can control the code flow to hit the unserialize call in form\_actions. In order to reach form\_actions, we need to set the action variable to actions, as shown in the extracted code snippet below:

```
switch (get_request_var('action')) {
	case 'save':
		form_save();
		break;
	case 'actions':
		form_actions();
		break;
	...
	...
}

```
### PoC

#### In graphs\_new.php

To hit the vulnerable code, an authenticated user sends a POST request that looks like the following:

[![graphs_new_example_request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965672-d691ccfa-b5ec-4544-87f0-79e3503a2b2f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965672-d691ccfa-b5ec-4544-87f0-79e3503a2b2f.png)

If we put an invalid object (e.g. one that is malformed or includes a class Cacti does not know about) as the value for the selected\_graphs\_array, we can see Cacti attempting to unserialize the payload in the logs:

[![graphs_new_unserialize_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965578-b666cc9b-ca09-4590-9b05-f65f87faee29.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965578-b666cc9b-ca09-4590-9b05-f65f87faee29.png)

At this point, we can easily control code flow to call unserialize on an arbitrary injected object.

#### In managers.php

To hit the vulnerable code, an authenticated user sends a POST request that looks like the following:

[![managers_example_request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965787-3237a8d9-63b2-4e25-bb6b-3ee4eb1276d5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965787-3237a8d9-63b2-4e25-bb6b-3ee4eb1276d5.png)

If we put an invalid object (e.g. one that is malformed or includes a class Cacti does not know about) as the value for the selected\_graphs\_array, we can see Cacti attempting to unserialize the payload in the logs:

[![managers_unserialize_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965808-8653b5cc-bf14-43c2-8d2c-20b4b29f74d2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9121784/219965808-8653b5cc-bf14-43c2-8d2c-20b4b29f74d2.png)

At this point, we can easily control code flow to call unserialize on an arbitrary injected object.

### Impact

#### Searching for Gadget Chains

There is one known usable gadget chain in Cacti’s PHP vendors, PHPSecLib. However, Cacti does not require or include any of the necessary php files that are needed in order to use the PHPSecLib gadget. Thus, these deserialization vulnerabilities can not be exploited in a vanilla installation of Cacti.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
