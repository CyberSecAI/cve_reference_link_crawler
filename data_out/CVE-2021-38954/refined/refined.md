- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Sterling B2B Integrator B2B API has a vulnerability that discloses sensitive version information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain knowledge of the software version being used, which could then be leveraged to further attacks if vulnerabilities associated with specific versions are known.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is through the B2B API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to interact with the B2B API to exploit the vulnerability.
