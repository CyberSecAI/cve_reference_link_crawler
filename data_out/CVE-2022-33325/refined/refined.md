The provided content is related to CVE-2022-33325.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of user-provided parameters in format strings within the `sfmt` or `sysprintf` functions, leading to command injection when the formatted string is passed to the `system` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection').
- Unsafe usage of `system` function with user-controlled data.
- Use of `sfmt` and custom `sysprintf` functions that format strings without proper sanitization, leading to injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system by injecting malicious commands within the parameters provided to the vulnerable endpoints. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted network packets to the vulnerable `/ajax/clear_tools_log/` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to send a POST or GET request with the malicious parameters

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
