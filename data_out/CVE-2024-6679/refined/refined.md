{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of `${}` to directly splice SQL statements with user-controlled input (`params.dataScope`) in the `mybatis-mappers/RoleMapper.xml` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to insecure handling of user input in SQL queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `api/role` endpoint by manipulating the `params[dataScope]` parameter within the HTTP request.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and control the `params[dataScope]` parameter. The specific SQL injection technique demonstrated is bool blind injection."
