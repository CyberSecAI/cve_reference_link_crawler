The content is related to CVE-2022-33326.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `sysprintf` function with user-controlled input, specifically the `archive_param` variable, in the `/ajax/config_rollback/` API endpoint. This leads to OS command injection because the user-supplied input is used within a `tar` command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS command injection: The `sysprintf` function constructs a command string with user-supplied input (`archive_param`) which is then passed to the `system()` function for execution. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands.
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a system command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, including data theft, denial of service, or further attacks on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/ajax/config_rollback/` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `archive` parameter.
- Network-based attack (since it's a web interface)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running on the Robustel R1510 device.
- The attacker would also need to know the format for the API request and have knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the web interface. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs to have High privileges to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that they need to already have an account that can access the device's web interface
