"Who decides" can be a tricky question.

Several organizations issue CVEs, like Red Hat and Gentoo. A bug
usually has to meet a criteria, like falling into a CWE category, to
be issued by the organization.

You can also get them from Mitre's site. In the case of Mitre, it is
the person who requests the CVE.

Some CVE's are tenuous or questionable. You often see this from folks
trying to pad their resume. For example, a researcher may request a
CVE for a behavior that requires elevated privileges. In this case,
someone who is Root on Linux or Administrator on Windows can already
do the damage, so the behavior in question that happens with
privileges is not really interesting.

In the case of HTTP::Tiny, the default configuration and behavior is
running afoul of <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html> and
<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html>. In this case, the
industry believes comms should use HTTPS and the name hostname should
be validated.

# Perl HTTP::Tiny has insecure TLS default, affecting CPAN.pm and other modules

15/04/23 â sgo

**UPDATE 2023-06-12:** [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) has been released with a fix.

[CVE-2023-31486] [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny) v0.082, is a http client included in
Perl (since v5.13.9) and also a standalone CPAN module. It [does not verify TLS
certificates by default](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny#SSL-SUPPORT) requiring users to opt-in with the `verify_SSL=>1` flag to verify the identity of the HTTPS server they are communicating with.

The module is used by
[many](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) distributions on
CPAN, and likely other open source and proprietary software.

> **NOTE:** This post summarizes security problems caused by the insecure default
> and how it affects code relying on it for https. For a
> discussion on how this is being addressed upstream, please see
> [RFC: Making SSL\_verify safer](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152)

## Affected CPAN Modules

After
[PSA: HTTP::Tiny disabled SSL verification by
default!](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/111tadi/psa_httptiny_disabled_ssl_verification_by_default/) was posted on Reddit, we were reminded that this might be a bigger problem than first thought.

So we searched trough
[metacpan-cpan-extracted](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-cpan-extracted)
to find distributions using HTTP::Tiny without specifying the cert verification
behaviour. Distros using it without mentioning `verify_SSL` somewhere in the code was flagged. See [hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) for the full list.

Most distributions we found did not enable the certificate verification feature, potentially exposing users to [machine-in-the-middle](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-machine-in-the-middle-attacks/Machine-in-the-middle) attacks via a [CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) weakness.

* [CVE-2023-31484] [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN) v2.34 downloads and executes code from
  `https://cpan.org` without verifying server certs. Fixed in [v2.35-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/ANDK/CPAN-2.35-TRIAL).
  ([patch](https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/9c98370287f4e709924aee7c58ef21c85289a7f0))
* [CVE-2023-31485] [GitLab::API::v4](https://metacpan.org/dist/GitLab-API-v4) v0.26 exposes API
  secrets to a network attacker. Fixed in [v0.27](https://metacpan.org/release/BLUEFEET/GitLab-API-v4-0.27)
  ([patch](https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/pull/57))
* [Finance::Robinhood](https://metacpan.org/dist/Finance-Robinhood) v0.21 is
  maybe exposing API secrets and financial information to a network
  attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/sanko/Finance-Robinhood/pull/6))
* [Paws (aws-sdk-perl)](https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws) v0.44 is
  maybe exposing API secrets to a network attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/pull/426))
* [CloudHealth::API](https://metacpan.org/pod/CloudHealth%3A%3AAPI) v0.01 is maybe
  exposing API secrets to a network attacker.
  ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/cloudhealth-api-perl/pull/2))

â¦ and more. We have done a search of CPAN and generated a list of [381 potentially problematic distributions](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/).

## Mitigations

~~Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has not provided a patch or mitigation. Suggestions to change the insecure default has been turned down several times over the years due to backwards compatibility concerns~~.

Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has [merged a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/pull/153) that changes the insecure default from `0` to `1`. It is available in the development version [HTTP::Tiny v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) on CPAN, and the change is [planned to be included in perl-5.38.0](https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2023/06/this-week-in-psc-109.html).

> An escape hatch environment variable `PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT=1` has been provided for users who need to restore the previous insecure default after updating.

For additional information, please see the upstream discussion in [RFC: Making SSL\_verify safer](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152).

To mitigate the risk caused by the [CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) weakness, you have some options:

* Ensure that `HTTP::Tiny` in your include path is [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) or newer.
* Modify affected code using `HTTP::Tiny` and set `verify_SSL=>1`.
* Modify affected code to use a http client with secure defaults, like
  `Mojo::UserAgent` or `LWP::UserAgent`.
* Patch `HTTP::Tiny` on your system with [a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/commit/77f557ef84698efeb6eed04e4a9704eaf85b741d.patch) that changes the default to `verify_SSL=>1`.

> Itâs recommended that users update [Mozilla::CA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mozilla%3A%3ACA) as well, since `HTTP::Tiny` defaults to trusting certificates provided by that module. Alternatively the environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` can be set to point to the system trust store.

The `verify_SSL` flag is missing from `HTTP::Tiny`, and allows a network attacker to MITM the connection if it is used by the CPAN client.

~~Luckily, CPAN.pm seems to prefer `curl` (and maybe `wget`) over `HTTP::Tiny` when doing https. Those tools verify server identity by default.~~

Problem has been verified using [mitmproxy](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/) on CPAN v2.34

| I'm assuming there still are systems out there that don't use certificates properly (e.g. the may use self-signed certs and failed to place introduce them correctly into their setup).  Since CPAN.pm often is used for bootstrapping Perl, would it be more sensible to introduce a warning and/or environment variable override first, and perhaps change the verify\_SSL attribute at some later point?  FWIW, I'm in favor of using this module as a tool to prod developers in the right direction when it comes to security issues (including certificate validation), but it seems to me that we may be asking a bit much if we expect a functioning CA chain of trust on a typical stripped-down minimal OS installation.  I'm happy if I'm proven wrong though; For example, if we can find out that most common & reasonably recent minimal OS images (e.g. container images) have /etc/ssl set up correctly, then I'd love to see verify\_SSL set to 1.  Still I'm also wondering how much actually can break with this change.  Would you mind sharing some of your own thoughts on this, [@stigtsp](https://github.com/stigtsp)? 🙂 |

| The concern is that HTTP::Tiny is used in some configurations to download packages from CPAN over https, without certificate verification.  Here is an example using the Perl image from Docker Hub. Note that this image has ca-certificates installed.  ``` $ docker run --rm -it registry.hub.docker.com/library/perl bash -c "echo | cpan CPAN" [..] Fetching with HTTP::Tiny: https://cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz [..] Fetching with HTTP::Tiny: https://cpan.org/modules/03modlist.data.gz [..] Fetching with HTTP::Tiny: https://cpan.org/authors/id/A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-2.34.tar.gz  ```  I'm unfamiliar with the bootstrap problem you are describing, but wouldn't it be possible to use plain http for those edge cases? It should be equally insecure as unverified https for downloading CPAN packages, imho. |

| The bootstrap problem I'm thinking of is related to a new developer's experience when trying out Perl for the first time. This is a PITA when SSL isn't set up correctly, and at this used to be the rule back in the day, when one really only had the choice to self-sign certificates or pay big money for a proper one. The situation has probably changed massively since letsencrypt became a thing, but may very well still be an issue in some situations... |

| I think this issue demonstrates that whenever CPAN.pm decides to use HTTP::Tiny for HTTPS requests, these are insecure and can be MITM'ed even if proper ca-certificates are installed on the system.  In addition to the official Docker perl image example, here is an example from Debian 11 with CPAN 2.34 installed (and autoconfigured):  ``` root@debian:~# cpan Mojolicious [..] Fetching with HTTP::Tiny: https://cpan.org/authors/id/S/SR/SRI/Mojolicious-9.31.tar.gz [..]  ```  Output from mitmproxy:  ``` >> GET https://cpan.org/                                                       ← 200 text/html 8.35k 71ms    GET https://cpan.org/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz                                ← 200 application/x-gzip 259.29k 79ms    GET https://cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz                      ← 200 application/x-gzip 2.36m 141ms    GET https://cpan.org/modules/03modlist.data.gz                              ← 200 application/x-gzip 248b 50ms    GET https://cpan.org/authors/id/S/SR/SRI/Mojolicious-9.31.tar.gz            ← 200 application/x-gzip 833.18k 99ms    GET https://cpan.org/authors/id/S/SR/SRI/CHECKSUMS                          ← 200 113k 106ms  ```  While wget correctly rejects a mitm'ed request against cpan.org:  ``` root@debian:~# wget -O - https://cpan.org/ --2023-04-12 09:10:08--  https://cpan.org/ Resolving cpan.org (cpan.org)... 151.101.193.55, 151.101.65.55, 151.101.1.55, ...

| I find this a very reasonable patch, thank you. Given that we have a switch to turn off https altogether, we can afford to make https, where it is turned on, as best as we can. I'll make a 2.35-TRIAL release over the weekend. |

	* backport Parse::CPAN::Meta patch from trunk (Steffen Mueller, David Golden)

	* The CPAN::PERL5INC experiment didn't work and all related code was

	in a session, which resets the list of directories added to PERL5LIB
	(David Golden)

	* address #34062: regain lost 'cpan .' command (reporter Slaven Rezic)

	* shut up "exited subroutine via last" warning in an expect loop

	* address #34102: wrong diagnostic message when no META.yml was there
	(reporter Slaven Rezic)

	* CPAN::PERL5INC now also used in available_file() so that testers that
	do not install can continue to work as before this module was introduced

	* new protection against subtly broken META.yml files (testcase provided
	by Form-Processor-Model-DBIC-0.01)

	* cleanup some files on whitespace, notably CRLF files that could
	confuse some svn clients

	* experimental support for optional_features in META.yml (pre-alpha)

	CPAN::SQLite is active

	* added 'halt_on_failure' config option to halt queue processing after
	the first failure rather than processing all remaining items
	(patch by David Golden; requested by Andrew Hampe and Matisse Enzer)

	* address #33505: allow empty passwords in the config and pass proxy
	data through to curl (suggestions by kevinarpe)

	* new diagnostics when CPAN.pm is required a second time. Introduce a
	sleep period when it is required several times because then a loop might
	be the cause and this might provide a clue to the user.

	* address #32525: when running the 'r' command, try to display the
	module name that is best suited for the distribution name (suggestion
	and prove of concept implementation by imacat)

	skip tests for a distribution and rely on test report results if a prior

	* protect against the infamous bug in Safe 2.13 that causes data
	corruption and ugly error messages like unknown method version::("")) or
	some such

	* let people disable the direct usage of gzip and tar by supplying a
	whitespace config variable

2007-04-07  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.90

	* new commands upgrade, is_tested, install_tested

	* improved visual navigation by colorized output and improved diagnostic
	messages

	* improved installation support for scripts without tarball

	* improved config management of internal variables

	* much more serialization of internal data into YAML, switchable between
	YAML and YAML::Syck

	* optional persistence between sessions

	* support for pseudo "dot" distros (local directories having nothing to
	do with CPAN)

	* reworked force pragma and new fforce pragma

	* new configuration variables auto_commit, build_requires_install_policy

	* improve diagnostics when gpg fails

	* bugfix persistence: do not restore pragmas

	* do the eval $VERSION tango for $CPAN::VERSION only when needed
	(allowing "1.90" with a trailing zero)

	* bugfix: if a dependency has been installed successfully but did not
	install the expected module, issue a warning and do not install again to
	prevent endless loops.

	* release 1.88_75: stable release candidate III

	* Win32 fix for 31sessions.t by Randy Kobes

	* flush non-archival files when the mirror changes (thanks for the

2007-01-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_71: this does not yet qualify as a release candidate for
	1.89 because it incorporates a major bugfix; but otherwise I think this
	is feature complete for a release

	* document treatment of requires and build_requires declarations

	others, like 'look', continue to work; at the same time make recursion
	detection a serious error that throws an exception and does not try to
	continue to execute

2007-01-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_69

	* bugfix: when determining unsatisfied prereqs, honour is_tested area

	* improve documentation about has_inst and dontload_list

	* several distropref files finetuned

2006-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_67

	* Redesigned 'force' pragma: only force at the level of the given

	Still a lot to do for 1.89.

	* address #23315: there were still some uncought exceptions in
	CPAN::Tarzip that broke megainstalls by Steve Peters; now hopefully all
	fixed

	* address #22584: do not set VERSION to "undef" when 0

	* bugfix: delete backups during downloading of new index files

	* bugfix: dirname(undef) can die: protect against it when an entry in
	FTPstats has no associated file

	* the failed command now prints its rows sorted by command (as before)
	but within each command by time.

	* the prereq check under the Module::Build installer is now performed by
	reading the _build/prereqs file instead of calling Module::Build
	directly. (Suggested by Ken Williams)

	* cleanup of the cache directory is now disabled for batch jobs;
	documentation is updated about the lock file the shell is holding

	distroprefs/00.README for details and distroprefs/ABH.XML-RSS.yml for an
	example (alpha)

	* small portions of patches from Randy Kobes applied to support
	CPAN::SQLite (pre-alpha; see Makefile.PL how to invoke)

2006-11-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_62

	* bugfix in randomize_urllist introduced in 1.88_61: setting the value

2006-11-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_61

	* This release is dedicated to imacat.

	package file (Thanks to imacat for the report)

	* new command 'hosts' to display some recent download statistics

	* new config parameter 'randomize_urllist' brings some randomness into
	the URL selection

	* if yaml_module not YAML and not available, fall back to YAML

2006-11-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_59

	* Note: the build_dir has got a major reworking with regard to how
	individual directories below it are being named. The names are now
	generated by File::Temp and contain a random part. This has the
	advantage that concurring users of CPAN.pm cannot disturb each other and
	the disadvantage that it is more difficult to identify which directory
	contains which build environment. If YAML is installed, then each
	directory is accompanied by a YAML file that stores a lot of state about
	the directory.

	The filename of the YAML file is C<< <directoryname>.yml >>

	* This release represents work in progress: new features marked as alpha
	below are still in flux and may change or be removed in the future.

	* Large chunk of documentation added about the many 'o conf' variants
	(after a smart kick From Marc Lehmann)

	* fix a bug reported by Sujith Emmanuel to survive when urllist contains
	illegal URLs

	* new bundle Bundle::CPANxxl with CPAN::Reporter, Module::Signature,
	Expect, etc.

	* many new sample distroprefs files (alpha)

	* new keyword "disabled" in distroprefs (alpha)

	* sanitize the behaviour after an Expect.pm timeout (alpha)

	* make running concurrent batch jobs safe (alpha)

	* lock the shell more granular to let many CPAN shells coexist (alpha)

	* several small bugfixes to the persistent distro state feature
	introduced in 1.88_58 (alpha)

	* very early incarnation of new install_tested command (alpha)

2006-10-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_58

	* new config option build_dir_reuse for persistent distro state in
	build_dir inspired by Ilya Zakharevich. (alpha!)

	* a few new and rewritten distropref files.

	* add distribution name to every OK/NOT OK; also inspired by Ilya.

	* bugfix on a rare bug related to the deletion of metadata after using a
	pragma on a distribution.

2006-10-24  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_57

	* address #22396: add a diagnostic warning at cleanup time when people
	have changed their config but forgot to safe it (Tina Mueller, Alberto
	Manuel Brandao Simoes).

	* workaround for a weird interaction with a dated version.pm in
	a probably dated Module::Build and UNIVERSAL::VERSION.

	* document the config variables that are overridable via distroprefs.

	* add prefer_installer to the list of overridable config variables.

	* new and updated prefs files for DBI, Coro, etc.

2006-10-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_56

	* add the ability to patch random distros both with local patches and
	with patches from CPAN. Demo patches to UNIVERSAL::require, Expect,
	Math::Pari, etc. are uploaded to my CPAN directory, corresponding YAML
	files are in the distroprefs directory. Heavily inspired by an old patch
	from Ilya Zakharevich.

	* fixes from Ilya Zakharevich to the PERL5LIB environment handling for
	not yet installed modules from a 3 year old patch.

	* work around a Module::Build issue with Build.PL files that are
	subclassing Module::Build like Error.pm and HTML::Mason. For now we fall
	back to the META.yml file. Needs further discussion with Module::Build
	people.

	* in the distroprefs system allow for YAML files with an arbitrary
	number of sections.

	* document how to integrate local distribution directories into the CPAN
	shell. See section 'Integrating local directories' in the manpage.

	* reporting of errors during unpacking is now integrated into the
	report section at the end of each command and the 'failed' command.

	* applied a patch by smpeters to silence an unini warning (RT #22277).

	* address #20979: trailing backslashes in MyConfig variables with test
	(Lars XXX via David Golden)

2006-10-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_55

	* new command 'report' as requested by Schwern in #22118.

	* extend the Distribution object to local directories. Gives a meaning
	to the 'cpan .' command. Suggested by Slaven Rezic.

	* removes the linux centric behaviour of t/30shell.t.

	* do not complain THAT often about uninstalled YAML or YAML::Syck; once
	is per distro enough.

2006-10-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_54

	* New option 'yaml_module' to switch between YAML.pm and YAML::Syck
	Try 'o conf init /yaml/' to use it.

	* New distroprefs system that lets the user store arguments, environment
	variables, individual answers to questions asked by Distributions when
	being built, and config overrides. Try 'o conf init /prefs/' for more
	information.

	* address #21144 major documentation bug: $obj->install is NOT the same
	as CPAN::Shell->install($obj) as soon as a queue of dependencies comes
	into play.

	* fix "o conf defaults" which was broken in 1.88_53.

	* protect us against Module::Build errors with an eval around the
	requires() and build_requires() calls.

2006-10-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_53

	* wrapping Module::Build calls into an eval to catch external errors
	with the right consequences.

	* 'reload cpan' now based on timestamps and always jumps into a fresh
	shell when needed.

	* display the version during loading of our own modules.

	* address #21692: make the "isa perl" case less noisy (Gabor Szabo)

	* new tests

	* fix old bug in CPAN::Version wrt installed developer versions

2006-09-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_51

	* dependencies declared as 'build_requires' are now treated according to
	a new policy option: try 'o conf init build_requires_install_policy' for
	more info. (Suggested/Requested by Johan Vromans)

	* fixed a bug where successful tests were repeated if things were not
	being installed like during the 'test' command itself.

	* address #21724: document that the 'r' command takes arguments; support
	the same arguments for the 'upgrade' command (Adam Kennedy)

	* address #21716: fix the broken 'recent' command (Phil Pennock)

	* fixed a rare but extremely unpleasant bug with deep recursion in
	AUTOLOAD during the 'reload cpan' command.

2006-09-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.8801

	* trivial bugfix: init dialog had a tweak that made it impossible to set
	'ncftp' when 'ncftpget' was installed and configured.

2006-09-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88

	* For detailed changes since 1.87 see the entries in the Changes file.
	For finer grained change log see the ChangeLog.svn file. The highlights
	of this release are:

	* convenient configuration: dialogs for individual items or groups of
	items can be accessed with a single command (Courtesy Jim Cromie)

	* experimental support for CPAN::Reporter: try
	    o conf init /test/
	(Courtesy David Golden)

	* make installation of scripts easier: try something like
	    install	SREZIC/pingomatic-1.012
	(Courtesy Slaven Rezic)

	* colored output for better separation of process output, messages from
	CPAN and warnings from CPAN: to turn colorization on/off try
	    o conf init /color/

	* formatting of lists of modules now features a column to indicate
	installed and updateable modules

	* signature checking can now be turned on and off with 'o conf check_sigs'

	* new command 'upgrade' installs newest version of all installed modules

	* Please note a minor incompatibility: the init dialog now has reversed
	semantics: it suggests automatic configuration that can be confirmed
	with 'yes' instead of suggesting manual configuration that can be denied
	with 'no'.

2006-09-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_65

	* Hunting missing documentation with Test::Pod::Coverage because my
	first try to use it started with a wrong copy&paste.

	* regex in "o conf init MATCH" must now be enclosed in slashes as in all
	other commands that allow regexes

	* again tested with 5.8.0, this time with an UTF8 locale and it did
	indeed not pass the 30test: turning LANG=C now for the 30shell test,
	unconditionally

	* all supported config variables now documented in the POD and added a
	test to monitor changes in the future

2006-09-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_63

	* release 1.87_62

	* make term_ornaments switchable while running (was only checked during
	initialization)

	the urllist dialog. (Address debian bug #380551)

2006-09-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_61

	* configuation of urllist uses a local urllist instead of the global

	go through the dialog with RETURN only

	* new options to get colored output: colorize_output, colorize_print,
	colorize_warn

2006-09-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_59: "o conf init MATCH" finally works and can be used to
	jump into the configuration dialog and select an arbitrary subset of
	questions.

	* perl -I. -MCPAN ... now works because we replaced C<no lib .> with
	rel2absing the INC (suggested by Slaven Rezic)

2006-08-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_58: work is still in progress to get "o conf init MATCH"
	working (finishing the epochal Jim Cromie patches) but all tests pass

	configuration can be confirmed with 'yes' instead of having to deny
	manual configuration with 'no'

	* fix a bug reported by David Golden, that Bundle::CPAN is never
	uptodate. Fixing it by special-casing readline.pm in the inst_file
	method. See also #17963.

	* Address #18196 once again because people have still MakeMaker < 6.18

	have no author or no distro and added some tests for these cases

2006-07-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_54

	* fix #18165: new config option term_ornaments

	* fix #20272: FirstTime::init did not preserve the space that signifies
	"disabled program"

2006-07-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_53

	* make *scripts* (as opposed to modules) installable when the path of
	the distro is given: you can now 'install ANDK/keepcool-0.344' and it is
	stored as 'keepcool'

	* the m command displays one column more: an equals sign if we have this
	version installed, a less-than sign if our installed version of the
	module is smaller and a space if we do not have this thing installed

	* fix #18438: weird dependency chain issue that broke
	amavis/SpamAssassin

	* fix #20168: when a user has neither Module::Signature nor gnupg, do
	not warn them

	* patch by Matisse Enzer to support authenticating proxies

	* new command "upgrade" installs newer versions of all installed modules
	if there are any (feature requested by Martin Sluka)

	* release 1.87_52

	* add support for check_sigs configuration option (turn signature
	checking on and off any time)

	* fix #18011: improved initial configuration according to suggestions by
	Vassilii Khachaturov

2006-03-06  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_51

	* patch by Max Maischein to quote commands that contain spaces as is
	often the case on Windows systems (addresses #17877)

	* do not display DSLIP_STATUS when it is empty; same thing for MANPAGE

	* add a security advice to the manpage

	* do not advertise Bundle::CPAN when a new CPAN is available, CPAN alone
	should do

2006-02-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87

	* new method dslip_status for Module objects

	* no t/dot-cpan/ directory in the distro anymore and removed after test

	* bugfix: when make clean failed, we did not list this as a fail

	* more tests in t/30shell.t, sub coverage on CPAN.pm now >75%

2006-02-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_53

	* t/30shell emits two test headers (fixes #17816; Adam Kennedy)

	* make Tarzip work better on uncompressed files; fixes test failure of
	test t/12cpan.t work under some conditions

	* t/30shell now skips tests that need uninstalled prerequisites and so
	passes all tests on a bare 5.8.8 for me when CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST is set

2006-02-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_52

	* simplification of the concepts of home and of the CPAN/MyConfig.pm and
	the CPAN/Config.pm. There were too many places that tried to do the same
	thing. Should now be centralized and consistent.

2006-02-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_51

	* replace the concept of $ENV{HOME} with File::HomeDir (fixes #17759;
	Adam Kennedy)

	* remove a spurious CARRIAGE RETURN in the Todo file: it broke
	Module::Signature on Windows (fixes #17746; Adam Kennedy)

	* return empty string instead of undef when HAVE_MAKE is false (fixes
	#17768; Adam Kennedy)

	* do not try to use $CPAN::Frontend before it exists (fixes #17770; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* t/12cpan.t now behaves on 5.004 and 5.005

	* t/30shell.t now can be run without Expect; needs to be enabled with
	environment variable CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST in this case

	* more testing in 30shell.t

2006-02-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86

	* quick fix for a bug in the Checksums checking code: if the cache had
	an old copy, it was in some cases not updated and if the file-to-check
	was newer, a false alarm was triggered.

	* I expect a 1.87 soonish, because we have open bugs: test 12cpan.t not
	suited for old perls; test for the above bug missing.

2006-02-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.85

	* Fix for 'install Bundle:CPAN' on Windows machines (closes #17699; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* Make a separate distro for Bundle::CPAN (works around the bug for
	older versions of CPAN)

	* Another fix for bundles: in some cases CPAN.pm installed an older
	bundle than the most recent

	* more tests: CPAN.pm subroutine coverage now at 71.4%

2006-02-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.84

	* see detailed release notes for releases 1.83_51 upto 1.83_69 below

	* highlights of the changes between 1.83 and 1.84: better error handling
	with new "failed" command and in many other places; new config variable
	ftp_passive is on by default; new command mkmyconfig; Module::Build
	support should now work on Windows and work better on all platforms; new
	methods for programmers CPAN::Module::distribution and
	CPAN::Distribution::author; improved docs; prettier output; and last not
	least a heavy dose of refactoring, bugfixing, and testing

	* Thanks to the bunch of helpful contributors and bug reporters (you
	know who you are:)

2006-02-14  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

2006-02-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_64 (potential release candidate for 1.84)

	* bugfix: when M:B specifies both requires AND build_requires AND then
	has no YAML to write the META.yml file, THEN we did not merge the two
	requiries. Seen in KCLARK/Text-RecordParser-v1.0.0.tar.gz.

	* release 1.83_62 came out today before this entry was written

	* rename the LC_ALL macro so that it does not infect the whole
	environment (Ken Williams)

	* new command mkmyconfig: patch supplied by Tyler MacDonald

2006-01-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_61

	* After a bugreport from Randy Kobes, another few small fixes to make
	sure that mbuild_install_build_command cannot make it through to be used
	anywhere.

	* release 1.83_60

	* bugfix: Do not use ./Build directly on Windows, it must be called
	together with the perl (fixes #17313; thanks to carl at fireartist for
	the report and a patch skeleton)

	* feature: 'o conf commit' now drops unknown config variables

	* bugfix for very rare cases: do not use CPAN::Distrostatus object
	methods on strings left over from the current session before a 'cpan
	reload' introduces the CPAN::Distrostatus class

	* bugfix: better switches for the call to curl

	* bugfix: more checks after lynx if the command was successful or not

	* docs: revisited the FAQ section

	* bugfix: if a META.yml specified a prerequisite module that we do not

	set; fixes #17266 (Adam Kennedy)

	* have 2 Default Hosts instead of one; fixes rt #17238 (Adam Kennedy)

	fixes rt #17237 and #17241 (Adam Kennedy)

	* give the cwd command more flexibility (stimulated by Ashley M. Kirchner)

	* bugfix: honour build_requires

2006-01-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_58

	* command processor tweak on Win32 (Jan Dubois, Gisle Aas)

	* README production was broken

	* Ongoing heavy refactoring of FirstTime, currently still without
	becoming visible to the user (Jim Cromie)

	* More tests for CPAN::Version with output comparing the results with
	Sort::Versions and version.pm

	* bugfix: double check the "later" attribute before you excuse and unset
	it if it is obsolete; fixes a bug where a postponed distro could be lost
	from the queue

	* output of as_glimpse more space efficient

2006-01-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_57

	* bugfix rt #17131 (Lee Goddard): better error messages on two
	unrecoverable errors that require user intervention

	* shell.t improved again: now the output reads really similar to a shell

	* improve error handling on Net::FTP connections (R. Hauser; fixes rt
	#1572)

	* shell.t starts working on installations that have a CPAN/Config.pm

2006-01-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_54

	* conveniently handle $Config->{make} on systems that often switch
	between dmake and nmake, like ActiveState's perl (Gisle Aas)

	* better choice for command processor on Win32 (Gisle Aas)

	* newest cpan script (1.51) from brian d foy

	* "force ls" now refetches the CHECKSUMS files

	* shell.t now conforming to Test-Anything-Protocol and hopefully working
	on more platforms.

2006-01-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_53

	* bugfix: if we have no YAML and no Makefile, we could not determine
	prereqs. Now fixed by using Module::Build.

	* bugfix: b command on unpublished bundles was broken due to wrong

	dressage of the FirstTime. It actually contains shell.t.

2006-01-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_51 brings

	* restructure FirstTime in a way to enable us to ask single questions RSN
	(Jim Cromie)

	* envariable CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL now available for subshells (Slaven Rezic)

	* enable date/time warnings without the help of HTTP::Date (inspired by
	a bogus bugreport on perl monks that was only due to wrong system time)

	* bugfix: hide CPAN::Config from the indexer

	* provide a more traditional style ChangeLog and Changes file

2006-01-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.82 and 1.83 are quick bugfix releases.

2006-01-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.81 adds on top of 1.80_58:

	* bugfix: completion of debug options was not case insensitive

	* bugfix: installation of distributions was broken for distros
	not mentioned in the index

	* include a hint that su might work as well as sudo in the dialog
	about make_install_make_command and mbuild_install_build_command

	* add Module::Signature to the Bundle and move Digest::SHA higher
	up so they start working as soon as possible

	* improve the dialog that ensues when bad signatures are
	encountered

2006-01-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_58 was a quick bugfix release

2005-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_57 adds on top of 1.80_56 the following:

	* prerequisites fixed: File::Temp was missing in PREREQ_PM and
	Bundle

	* reduce noise when $Debug is on

	* improved handling of whitespace in filenames (Roland Bauer;
	rt.cpan.org #3201)

	* add the Module::Build configuration parameters to the required
	parameters (thus users are relayed to the init dialog)

	* import less symbols

	* enhanced robustness if cwd gets removed while we're running
	(Rhet Turnbull; rt.cpan.org #321)

	* add "notest" to the completion table

	* enhanced robustness when untar is failing or poses permission
	problems

	* iron out some buglets in the "ls GLOB" code

	* enhanced robustness on "reload cpan" when the path to CPAN.pm
	has changed

	* replace some hash accesses with method calls for a cleaner
	interface (Work in Progress; no user-visible changes)

	* do not fail anymore when finding empty files left over from a
	previous unsuccessful download

	* uptodate message more descriptive (Adam Kennedy; rt.cpan.rg
	#15580)

2005-12-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_56 is a release candidate for 1.81

	* integrate release 1.5 of brian's cpan script from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/

	* Support for Module::Build: to set the preference for
	Module::Build over MakeMaker, run

	  o conf prefer_installer MB
	  o conf commit

	* ls command supports globbing; these work nicely:

	  ls KWILLIAMS/P*
	  ls JV/make*

	this works too but is slow:

	  ls */*make*

	* META.yml data replace the Makefile parsing code if YAML
	available (compensating for the frequent wrong usage of the
	requires element)

	* support SHA256; stop using MD5

	* support bzip2 compression; can be tested with 'install
	ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2'; the CPAN indexer does
	not yet index bz2 distros but will probably start to do so as soon
	as CPANPLUS supports bzip2

	* tiny tweaks to make CPAN.pm run on a busybox (Guillaume Filion)

	* bugfix: major speedup on all commands that need expansion of
	regular expressions to module names

	* prettier r command output: the 4th column of the 'r' command
	drops the redundant X/XX/ prefix

	* tolerant when you type one colon instead of two on module names

2005-12-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* this is release 1.80

	* support for Module::Signature courtesy Autrijus Tang

	* separated out new module CPAN::Version that has muchly improved
	support for multidot version notation that should make the
	deployment of version.pm easy for everybody. During the last weeks
	the indexer on PAUSE also got improved version.pm support and
	spits out numified versions. This release is optimized for the new
	version handling, regardless if used with or without version.pm
	(Thanks to John Peacock and to Graham Barr for their help)

	* new pragma 'notest' courtesy Slaven Rezic

	* support for sudo in the config variable
	'make_install_make_command' courtesy Michael Richardson

	* new commands 'recent' and 'perldoc' courtesy Toni Prug

	* improved wget support for Windows users courtesy Daniel

	* cleanup internal use of CPAN::Frontend courtesy David Storrs

	* fixes to distro bugs by Adriano Ferreira

	* runs under 5.004_05 courtesy Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni

	* new feature 'show_upload_date': if set to true, all 'm' and 'd'
	commands will display the upload date

	* fix bug in FirstTime causing endless loop under some conditions

	* better completion for config variables and a new warning if an
	unregistered config variable is being set

	* improved some error messages

	* improved help menu (Thanks to David Golden for the suggestion)

Actually, Gentoo is NOT a CNA, and thus cannot issue CVEs.

Subject: Perl's HTTP::Tiny has insecure TLS cert default, affecting CPAN.pm
 and other modules

HTTP::Tiny v0.082, a Perl core module since v5.13.9 and available
standalone on CPAN, does not verify TLS certs by default. Users must
opt-in with the verify_SSL=>1 flag to verify certs when using HTTPS.

We grepped trough CPAN to find distributions using HTTP::Tiny that
didn't specify cert verification behaviour, possibly exposing users to
mitm attacks. Here are some examples with patches:

- CPAN.pm v2.34 downloads and executes code from <https://cpan.org>
  without verifying server certs. Fixed in v2.35-TRIAL.
  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/9c98370287f4e709924aee7c58ef21c85289a7f0>

- GitLab::API::v4 v0.26 exposes API secrets to a network attacker.
  <https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/pull/57>

- Finance::Robinhood v0.21 is maybe exposing API secrets and financial
  information to a network attacker.
  <https://github.com/sanko/Finance-Robinhood/pull/6>

- Paws (aws-sdk-perl) v0.44 is maybe exposing API secrets to a network
  attacker.
  <https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/pull/426>

- CloudHealth::API v0.01 is maybe exposing API secrets to a network
  attacker.
  <https://github.com/pplu/cloudhealth-api-perl/pull/2>

... and more. We have generated a list of over 300 potentially affected
CPAN distributions.

certificates when downloading distributions over HTTPS. CPAN 2.35 - Add
verify\_SSL=>1 to HTTP::Tiny to verify https server identity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Mon May 15 2023 Jitka Plesnikova jplesnik@redhat.com - 2.36-1
- 2.36 bump
\* Tue May 2 2023 Jitka Plesnikova jplesnik@redhat.com - 2.35-1
- 2.35 bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
