# Laragon

## Modern & Powerful - Easy OperationProductive. Portable. Fast. Effective. Awesome!

I was using Xampp for local development until about a year ago when I found Laragon & I haven't looked back since. This is seriously the most powerful local development tool I have in my entire "developer toolkit".
I started working for a new company about 2 months ago & their entire team was using various setups for local dev and were always encountering problems. Setting up a new project locally was always a nightmare for them due to mysql version conflicts, having to change php versions, etc. When I introduced Laragon to them, they were amazed at how easy it was to install, maintain and how flexible it was to update/switch their dependencies. My manager told me that since the team has started using Laragon for local dev, **project setup time has gone down from an average of 6 HOURS, to less than 30 mins**. AMAZING.

Laragon is the best - and fastest - local server by far! [@SniffleValve](https://forum.laragon.org/topic/667/laragon-is-the-best-and-fastest-local-server-by-far "Laragon is the best - and fastest - local server by far!")

I used WAMPP & XAMPP with the known headaches that result from certain configuration issues such as being left in red or orange and not allowing work. Laragon works from the first minute and has well-coordinated tools. [@BLGNet](https://twitter.com/BLGNet/status/1121486920532541440)

Hey @leovn, thank you very much for Laragon, I just convinced some hard core Linux fans to take a look and they were extremely impressed!
Keep up the great job you're doing

This is the best web server software. I've abandoned xampp. Laragon is very easy to use (switching PHP versions etc), light weight and the most important part is, I love the auto create virtual hosts feature and cmder. Thanks for providing this superb tool!

Since I used Laragon a few months ago, I fell in love right away.

Developing with Laragon is just awesome ;) You don't need Docker anymore.
