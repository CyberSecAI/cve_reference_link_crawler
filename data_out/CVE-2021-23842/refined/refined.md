- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The communication between the AMC2 and the host system utilizes the Blowfish algorithm for symmetric encryption. The cryptographic key is hardcoded within the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt and modify network traffic, decrypt the device's firmware, and change the device configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs access to the local network, typically within the same subnet as the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network (or a connected network) as the device to intercept network traffic. They do not require any authentication credentials.
