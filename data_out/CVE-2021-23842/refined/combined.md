## Summary

The Bosch AMC2 (Access Modular Controller) is an door access controller. It takes access control decisions for a group of up to eight access points. These access points may consist of doors, gates, barriers, turn stiles, revolving doors, man-traps, ID card readers, door opening elements and sensors. The device is designed for fully process the access logic at the assigned entrances.

Two discovered security vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to decrypt network traffic and change device configuration. This affects Bosch products Building Integration System (BIS), Access Management System (AMS), Access Professional Edition (APE), and Access Modular Controller (AMC2).

For more details please see the description of the vulnerabilities in this advisory.

Bosch rates the vulnerabilities CVE-2021-23842 and CVE-2021-23843 with a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 5.7 (Medium) and 8.8 (High) respectively. The actual rating depends on the individual vulnerability and the final rating on the customerâs environment.

Customers are strongly advised to update to the fixed versions or consider listed mitigation.

Both vulnerabilities were discovered by external security researcher Alexander Nochvay of Kaspersky.

## Affected Products

* Bosch AMC2
* Bosch AMS < 4.0
* Bosch APE <= 3.8.x
* Bosch BIS < 4.9.1

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the affected Bosch software to an improved version. The latest versions BIS 4.9.1 and AMS 4.0 are immune against the discovered vulnerabilities CVE-2021-23842 and CVE-2021-23843. This update will change the communication between controllers and backend and will introduce DTLS communication for AMS and BIS.

Please note that AMS and BIS will update AMC2 controllers with a strengthened firmware automatically. Please refer to technical documentation in the software release for more details.

There is a patch for APE addressing CVE-2021-23843. If you want to address also CVE-2021-23842 then we recommend to migrate the APE installation to AMS 4.0 or BIS 4.9.1.

### Mitigations

We recommend to update AMS and BIS to version 4.0 resp. 4.9.1 immediately as described in section Software Updates. This will address both vulnerabilities CVE-2021-23842 and CVE-2021-23843.

For AMS and BIS installations which cannot be updated to version 4.0 resp. 4.9.1 immediately, Bosch has prepared patches which will distribute a hardened firmware to the AMC2 door controllers. This patch addresses CVE-2021-23843.

For APE 3.8.x installations there is a patch addressing CVE-2021-23843.

Please notice that the patch will reduce convenience of the AMC2 configuration. Please refer to the patches' technical documentation for details.

If you want to reduce the security risk further, we recommend to follow general IT hardening guidelines and especially operate access control in a secured  local area network.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2021-23842

CVE description: Communication to the AMC2 uses a state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithm for symmetric encryption called Blowfish. An attacker could retrieve the key from the firmware to decrypt network traffic between the AMC2 and the host system.

Thus, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt and modify network traffic, decrypt and further investigate the device's firmware file, and change the device configuration.

The attacker needs to have access to the local network, typically even the same subnet.

* Problem Type:
  + [CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)
* CVSS Vector String:  [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
  + Base Score: 5.7 (Medium)

### CVE-2021-23843

CVE description: The Bosch software tools AccessIPConfig.exe and AmcIpConfig.exe are used to configure certains settings in AMC2 devices. The tool allows putting a password protection on configured devices to restrict access to the configuration of an AMC2. An attacker can circumvent this protection and make unauthorized changes to configuration data on the device.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the device's configuration or make it unresponsive in the local network.

The attacker needs to have access to the local network, typically even the same subnet.

* Problem Type:
  + [CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
* CVSS Vector String:  [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + Base Score: 8.8 (High)

### Remark

Vulnerability classification has been performed using the  [CVSS v3.1 scoring system](https://www.first.org/cvss/)  . The CVSS environmental score is specific to each customerâs environment and should be defined by the customer to attain a final scoring.
