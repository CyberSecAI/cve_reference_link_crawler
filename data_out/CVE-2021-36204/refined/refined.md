- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Insufficiently protected credentials. The affected versions of Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers could expose plaintext credentials through application programmable interface (API) calls under certain circumstances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of credentials accessible via API calls (CWE-522).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of credentials in plain text to unauthenticated users. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and control of the affected systems.
- **Attack vectors:** API calls to the Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to be in a position to make API calls to the vulnerable server, which is described as a local attack vector, although the specific user interface is required (UI:R) for exploitation..

The advisory indicates that no public exploits are known, and the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, which contradicts the "AV:L" (local) setting from the CVSS vector.
