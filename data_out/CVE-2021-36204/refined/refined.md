Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36204:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from the CISA advisory directly references **CVE-2021-36204** and states "Under certain circumstances, the affected versions of Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers could expose plaintext credentials through application programmable interface (API) calls." Therefore, the content is **relevant** to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficiently protected credentials within the Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way the system handles API calls.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the exposure of plaintext credentials through API calls in certain scenarios. This falls under CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to an unauthenticated attacker gaining access to sensitive credentials in plain text. This could then be used for unauthorized system access or further malicious activity. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system (C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through API calls, which implies a network-based attack vector (although not directly from the internet per se, see below). It's specified as being locally exploitable (AV:L) suggesting an attacker must have some form of access to the network where the vulnerable system is operating, and does not require a user interaction (UI:R is false).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would require network access to the system, however they don't require system privileges (PR:N), or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The attack complexity is low (AC:L) which suggest a relatively easy to execute attack.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The CISA advisory provides specific affected product versions: Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Version 10.X (all versions prior to 10.1.6) and Version 11.X (all versions prior to 11.0.3).
*   It provides mitigation steps including patching the affected systems.
*   It stresses the importance of isolating control system networks behind firewalls and restricting remote access.
*   It notes that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability, and that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely from the internet.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2021-36204 is a vulnerability in Johnson Controls Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers, where an unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network could potentially expose sensitive credentials in plaintext by crafting specific API calls. The vulnerability can lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Mitigation involves applying the vendor-provided patches for the affected versions.
