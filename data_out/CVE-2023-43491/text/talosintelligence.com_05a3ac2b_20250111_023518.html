# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1863

## Peplink Smart Reader web interface /cgi-bin/debug\_dump.cgi information disclosure vulnerability

##### April 17, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-43491

##### SUMMARY

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the web interface /cgi-bin/debug\_dump.cgi functionality of Peplink Smart Reader v1.2.0 (in QEMU). A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Peplink Smart Reader v1.2.0 (in QEMU)

##### PRODUCT URLS

Smart Reader - <https://www.peplinkworks.com/Smart-Reader.asp>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.3 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-284 - Improper Access Control

##### DETAILS

The Peplink Smart Reader is the access-control hardware associated with the PepXIM Time-Logging and Security System. It is used to manage access to buildings, workstations and public transit, as well as for employee time management.

The Peplink Smart Reader exposes a web server on port 443 intended for local configuration and control of the card reader. This web server exposes an unauthenticated endpoint at `/cgi-bin/debug_dump.cgi`. This appears to be used when Peplink support needs more significant diagnostic information to troubleshoot an issue and the device is in a situation where the ‘REMOTE\_ASSISTANCE’ functionality is not feasible. This endpoint is handled by a standalone shell script located at `/web/cgi-bin/debug_dump.cgi`, which does not implement any form of authentication.

The shell script initially runs a series of commands (output collected in `/tmp/debug.dump`), then executes a final `tar` command that creates an archive of the diagnostic output in `/tmp/debug.dump`, as well as specific files and directories as listed in the below command.

```
(tar cf - /etc/software-release \
          /etc/build \
          /etc/build_timestamp \
          /etc/wifi*[._]* \
          /etc/ap*[._]* \
          /etc/wapi*[._]* \
          /etc/portal_* \
          /etc/model \
          /etc/*product* \
          /etc/hardware* \
          /etc/hw_ver \
          /etc/variant \
          /etc/masterconfig* \
          /etc/last_reboot_reason \
          /etc/resolv.conf \
          /etc/icclient.cfg \
          /etc/net/* \
          /etc/mac/* \
          /etc/ppp/* \
          /etc/cwmp/* \
          /etc/hostapd* \
          /etc/nfc.conf \
          /var/log/submit_cloud.log* \
          /var/log/message* \
          /var/log/vpn_daemon.log* \
          /var/log/vpn/* \
          /var/log/nfc-*.log \
          /var/run/* \
          /var/spool/* \
          /tmp/debug.dump/* \
          |gzip - -c 2> /dev/null | xor)

```

Lastly, the archive is gzip compressed and piped through a binary named `xor`, which is responsible for enciphering the archive. This application implements a byte-by-byte XOR encoding, where every byte of the archive is XOR’d with the value 0x32.

An unauthenticated attacker who submits an HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/debug_dump.cgi` endpoint can decode, decompress and unarchive the file, granting them access to significant information about the device, including sensitive information such as the administrative user’s username and MD5 password hash.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

```
wget --no-check-certificate https://${TARGET}/cgi-bin/debug_dump.cgi

```
