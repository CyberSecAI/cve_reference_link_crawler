Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `userName` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `userName` parameter.
*   **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Query:** The application constructs the SQL query using string concatenation with user-provided data, rather than using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Exposure:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential Server Compromise:** In severe cases, successful exploitation of SQL injection could lead to full server compromise depending on database configuration and privileges.
*   **Database Name Disclosure**: As mentioned, the database name was successfully extracted using SQLMap.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `userName` parameter in the GET request: `r=bishe/register?userName=`.
*   **Direct SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `userName` parameter with SQL syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application where the vulnerable endpoint is accessible.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable parameter is `userName` in the route `r=bishe/register?userName=`.
* The injection occurs within the `selectAllListPage()` method of the mapper layer, where user input is directly used in constructing the SQL query.
*  The vulnerability allows for database name enumeration.
