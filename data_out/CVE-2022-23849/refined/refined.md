Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-23849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the implementation of the biometric application lock (FaceID) within the Devolutions Password Hub for iOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is that the biometric lock can be bypassed by rapidly failing the authentication process multiple times in succession. This indicates a lack of proper rate-limiting or lockout mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the FaceID lock, gaining unauthorized access to the application. This could lead to full compromise of the password and other secrets stored within.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is physical access to the device with the Devolutions Password Hub for iOS installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs physical access to the device where the vulnerable application is installed. They do not need any prior credentials or knowledge of the biometric authentication. They need to trigger rapid successive authentication failures.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity.
*   The affected product is Devolutions Password Hub for iOS versions 2021.3.3 and older.
*   The fix is available in version 2021.3.4.
*   The CVSS score is 3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability if exploited, but low attack complexity due to the required physical access to device.
