| We click on file management to go to the management location of the website and directory.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54017627/154784040-c571d842-3a18-49b2-a697-41858984921b.png)  Click to edit the .htaccess file and add a line at the end, 'AddType application/x-httpd-php.php3', click Save.  The function of the statement 'AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3' is to execute all files with the .php3 suffix as .php files.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54017627/154784292-2bef774f-d834-4023-a73f-a1be3cf4d357.png)  We create a 1.php3 file and write''to 1.php3.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54017627/154784394-10d479c5-e0b4-4a34-94b2-d7c75155d615.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54017627/154784453-82cd23c8-9ef0-47ea-843b-6505470ab808.png)  Visit the 1.php3 file in the directory of the website and find that it has been executed successfully. It's really great.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54017627/154784502-e2cd9655-8e4f-4885-bfcb-c96b14bf4d5a.png) |
