- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mk_informix` agent plugin was making calls to the binaries `dbaccess` and `onstat` without proper security measures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Potential privilege escalation due to unsafe execution of `dbaccess` and `onstat`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers with low privileges may be able to escalate their privileges. The impact of the exploitation can cause a loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker with low privileges is required. The attacker does not need user interaction.
