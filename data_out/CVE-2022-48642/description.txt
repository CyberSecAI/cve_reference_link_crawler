In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix percpu memory leak at nf_tables_addchain()

It seems to me that percpu memory for chain stats started leaking since
commit 3bc158f8d0330f0a ("netfilter: nf_tables: map basechain priority to
hardware priority") when nft_chain_offload_priority() returned an error.
