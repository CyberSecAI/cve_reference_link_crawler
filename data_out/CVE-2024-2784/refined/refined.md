Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the "Hover Card" widget of the "The Plus Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
*   The plugin doesn't adequately escape output, enabling the execution of injected scripts when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   The injected scripts will execute whenever any user accesses the compromised page.
*   This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the "Hover Card" widget of the plugin.
*   Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through user-supplied attributes of this widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have an authenticated WordPress account with at least contributor-level access.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create/edit pages/posts that uses the vulnerable widget.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Wordfence article provides a good explanation of the vulnerability.
* The provided changeset in the WordPress Trac link indicates the release of version 5.5.5 of the plugin, which resolves the vulnerability, and lists the large number of files added in the patched version, providing context for the scale of the update.
