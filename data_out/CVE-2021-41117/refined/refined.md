{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The library uses a flawed Lehmer LCG random number generator to seed the CMAC counter when a strong CSPRNG is not available, due to incorrect encoding of the LCG output.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Poor random number generation due to using a Lehmer LCG seeded with Math.random as a fallback.",
    "Incorrect encoding of the LCG output, leading to a buffer mostly filled with zeros.",
    "Failure to use the Node.js CSPRNG due to a variable shadowing issue."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Generation of weak RSA keys that are easily guessable, allowing an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain unauthorized access to accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs during the generation of RSA keys by the vulnerable library.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to target systems or applications that utilize the vulnerable keypair library to generate RSA keys."
