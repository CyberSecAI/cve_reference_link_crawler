- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `setSchedWifi` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-controlled `schedStartTime` parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. The size of the destination buffer `ptr` is 25 bytes, and the user input isn't validated, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack overflow vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint with an overly long `schedStartTime` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
