- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unquoted path to the ESET Forwarder (efwd.exe) service stored in the registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted path privilege vulnerability. The service path was stored in the registry without being enclosed in quotes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially drop a malicious program to a specific location on disk and have it run with the permissions of the user running the service (NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService). This could lead to unauthorized access to system resources or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the unquoted path to the ESET Forwarder service. This is achieved by placing a malicious executable in the path that will be executed by the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious executable in a specific location. This attack is possible immediately after an upgrade from a previous ESET product version. The attacker needs local access (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L) to the system to place this file.
