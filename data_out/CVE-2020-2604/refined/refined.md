Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-2604:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of serialization filters in OpenJDK.  Specifically, it's related to how the `jdk.serialFilter` property can be modified, leading to a potential bypass of the intended filter during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Serialization Filter Handling:** The core issue is in the way OpenJDK applies serialization filters, allowing for potential circumvention of these filters. This implies a flaw in the logic or enforcement of these filters within the deserialization process.
*   **Property Modification:** The vulnerability can be triggered by modification of the `jdk.serialFilter` property, a mechanism intended to control deserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of intended filter during serialization:** By manipulating `jdk.serialFilter` an attacker could bypass the intended deserialization restrictions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** While not explicitly stated in all sources, the ability to bypass serialization filters often carries the risk of arbitrary code execution, as it could enable an attacker to deserialize malicious objects. Some sources hint at the potential for code execution or unspecified impacts. 

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Deserialization:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the deserialization process, using a modified `jdk.serialFilter` property to bypass defined restrictions.
*   **Network:** Many sources indicate the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can likely trigger the vulnerability via network communications.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** A network connection to a vulnerable service utilizing OpenJDK is generally needed, except for specific local cases.
*   **Ability to trigger deserialization:** The attacker must be able to initiate a deserialization process and be capable of influencing the `jdk.serialFilter` property. This may involve crafting malicious serialized objects.

**Additional Information from Different Sources:**

*   **Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4621-1):** This advisory notes that the vulnerability is present in `openjdk-8` and can result in denial of service, incorrect Kerberos GSSAPI/TGS requests, or incorrect TLS handshakes. It also indicates that the issue was fixed in version `8u242-b08-1~deb9u1`.
*   **Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202101-19):** This advisory mentions that `openjdk` packages prior to version `8.272_p10` are affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-2604.  It also indicates that a remote attack is possible and could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2020:0470, RHSA-2020:0467 and RHSA-2020:0128 ):** These advisories note that this CVE is fixed in updates to various java packages in RHEL 7 and 8 and IBM Java SE. Also confirms the root cause of the vulnerability to be improper handling of serialization filter changes through modifications of the jdk.serialFilter property.
*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021:** This advisory includes CVE-2020-2604 in a risk matrix for multiple products and notes it affects Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, and several Oracle Commerce components, indicating a widespread vulnerability across the Oracle ecosystem.
*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020:** Shows  CVE-2020-2604 affecting Oracle Commerce Guided Search with a network exploitable vector and indicates the Content Acquisition System is impacted.
*   **openSUSE Security Update 2020:0147-1:**  This update shows the vulnerability was resolved by updating java-1_8_0-openjdk to version jdk8u242 (icedtea 3.15.0)
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4257-1):** This notice states the vulnerability is related to how OpenJDK incorrectly handled the application of serialization filters. Also notes the vulnerability may allow for a bypass during serialization.
*   **Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2020:0232** This advisory indicates the vulnerability resides within OpenJDK's serialization filters and can be bypassed through modifications to `jdk.serialFilter` property. Also identifies packages required to fix this vulnerability.

In Summary, CVE-2020-2604 is caused by incorrect handling of serialization filters in OpenJDK, enabling a bypass by modifying the `jdk.serialFilter` property which could lead to remote code execution or a denial-of-service. This vulnerability has a wide range of impacts across multiple vendors and products utilizing vulnerable versions of OpenJDK.
