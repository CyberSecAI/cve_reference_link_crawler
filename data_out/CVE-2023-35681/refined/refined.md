```
{
  "Root cause": "The tx mtu in EATT can be controlled by a remote device. Malicious mtu values can trigger integer overflows and out-of-bounds writes.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact": "Remote code execution",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious remote device can send crafted mtu values over EATT.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to communicate with the target device over EATT (Enhanced Attribute Transport Tunnel)."
