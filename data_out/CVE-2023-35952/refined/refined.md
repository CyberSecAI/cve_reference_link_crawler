```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `readOFF` function of the libigl library when parsing OFF files. This is due to the unsafe usage of `fscanf` with unbounded format strings.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stack-based buffer overflow: Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when reading comments related to faces in the OFF file format.
- Unbounded format string: The `fscanf` function uses the format string "%[^\n]", which reads characters until a newline is encountered, without checking the size of the destination buffer.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application.
- Application crash: The buffer overflow could cause the application to crash.

Attack vectors:
- Specially crafted OFF file: An attacker can create a malicious OFF file containing a long comment that will overflow the buffer when parsed by the vulnerable library.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted .off file to the vulnerable application to trigger the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required as the application must load the malicious .off file
