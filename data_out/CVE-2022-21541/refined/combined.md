ChangeLog:

\* Sun Jul 24 2022 Andrew Hughes gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:1.8.0.342.b07-1
- Update to shenandoah-jdk8u342-b07 (GA)
- Update release notes for 8u342-b07.
- Switch to GA mode for final release.
- Exclude x86 where java\_arches is undefined, in order to unbreak build
\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Jiri Vanek gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:1.8.0.342.b06-0.4.ea
- moved to build only on %{java\_arches}
-- <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_JDKs>
- reverted :
-- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild> (always mess up release)
-- Try to build on x86 again by creating a husk of a JDK which does not depend on itself
-- Exclude x86 from builds as the bootstrap JDK is now completely broken and unusable
-- Reinstate demo package on x86
-- Temporarily disable noarch status of javadoc and javadoc-zip so x86 can differ
-- Replaced binaries and .so files with bash-stubs on i686
- added ExclusiveArch: %{java\_arches}
-- this now excludes i686
-- this is safely backport-able to older fedoras, as the macro was backported proeprly (with i686 included)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-b76ab52e73
2022-08-03 01:48:48.037691
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : java-latest-openjdk
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 18.0.2.0.9
Release : 1.rolling.fc35
URL : <http://openjdk.java.net/>
Summary : OpenJDK 18 Runtime Environment
Description :
The OpenJDK 18 runtime environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

# New in release OpenJDK 18.0.2 (2022-07-19) \* Full release notes can be found
at <https://builds.shipilev.net/backports-monitor/release-notes-18.0.2.txt> ##
Security fixes \* JDK-8272243: Improve DER parsing - JDK-8272249: Better
properties of loaded Properties - JDK-8277608: Address IP Addressing -
JDK-8281859, CVE-2022-21540: Improve class compilation - JDK-8281866,
CVE-2022-21541: Enhance MethodHandle invocations - JDK-8282676: Improve
subject handling - JDK-8283190: Improve MIDI processing - JDK-8284370:
Improve zlib usage - JDK-8285407, CVE-2022-34169: Improve Xalan supports ##
JDK-8288367: CPU Shares Ignored When Computing Active Processor Count Previous
JDK releases used an incorrect interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter
`cpu.shares`. This might cause the JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading
to an under utilization of CPU resources when the JVM is used inside a
container. Starting from this JDK release, by default, the JVM no longer
considers `cpu.shares` when deciding the number of threads to be used by the
various thread pools. The `-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can
be used to revert to the previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may
be removed in a future JDK release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Andrew Hughes gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:18.0.2.0.9-1.rolling
- Update to jdk-18.0.2 release
- Update release notes to 18.0.2
- Drop JDK-8282004 patch which is now upstreamed under JDK-8282231
- Exclude x86 where java\_arches is undefined, in order to unbreak build
\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Jiri Vanek gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:18.0.1.1.2-8.rolling
- moved to build only on %{java\_arches}
-- <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_JDKs>
- reverted :
-- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild> (always mess up release)
-- Try to build on x86 again by creating a husk of a JDK which does not depend on itself
-- Exclude x86 from builds as the bootstrap JDK is now completely broken and unusable
-- Replaced binaries and .so files with bash-stubs on i686
- added ExclusiveArch: %{java\_arches}
-- this now excludes i686
-- this is safely backport-able to older fedoras, as the macro was backported properly (with i686 included)
- <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104125>
\* Thu Jul 21 2022 Fedora Release Engineering releng@fedoraproject.org - 1:18.0.1.1.2-7.rolling.1

processing - JDK-8284370: Improve zlib usage - JDK-8285407, CVE-2022-34169:
Improve Xalan supports ## FIPS Changes \*
[RH2007331](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007331>): SecretKey
generate/import operations don't add the CKA\_SIGN attribute in FIPS mode \*
[RH2036462](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036462>):
sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.getInstance breakage \*
[RH2090378](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090378>): Revert to
disabling system security properties and FIPS mode support together \* Depend on
`crypto-policies` package at build-time and run-time ## Other Changes \* Add
javaver- and origin-specific javadoc and javadoczip alternatives (thanks to FeRD
(Frank Dana) ferdnyc@gmail.com) ## JDK-8285240: HTTPS Channel Binding support
for Java GSS/Kerberos Support has been added for TLS channel binding tokens for
Negotiate/Kerberos authentication over HTTPS through
`javax.net.HttpsURLConnection`. Channel binding tokens are increasingly
required as an enhanced form of security which can mitigate certain kinds of
socially engineered, man in the middle (MITM) attacks. They work by
communicating from a client to a server the client's understanding of the
binding between connection security (as represented by a TLS server cert) and
higher level authentication credentials (such as a username and password). The
server can then detect if the client has been fooled by a MITM and shutdown the
session/connection. The feature is controlled through a new system property
`jdk.https.negotiate.cbt` which is described fully at the following page:
<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html#jdk.https.negotiate.cbt ## JDK-8278386: Default JDK
compressor will be closed when IOException is encountered
`DeflaterOutputStream.close()` and `GZIPOutputStream.finish()` methods have been
modified to close out the associated default JDK compressor before propagating a
`Throwable` up the stack. `ZIPOutputStream.closeEntry()` method has been
modified to close out the associated default JDK compressor before propagating
an `IOException`, not of type `ZipException`, up the stack. ## JDK-8277157:
Vector should throw ClassNotFoundException for a missing class of an element
`java.util.Vector` is updated to correctly report `ClassNotFoundException that
occurs during deserialization using
`java.io.ObjectInputStream.GetField.get(name, object)` when the class of an
element of the Vector is not found. Without this fix, a
`StreamCorruptedException` is thrown that does not provide information about the
missing class.

ChangeLog:

\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Andrew Hughes gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:11.0.16.0.8-1
- Update to jdk-11.0.16+8
- Update release notes to 11.0.16+8
- Switch to GA mode for release
- Exclude x86 where java\_arches is undefined, in order to unbreak build
\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Jiri Vanek gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:11.0.16.0.7-0.4.ea
- moved to build only on %{java\_arches}
-- <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_JDKs>
- reverted :
-- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild> (always mess up release)
-- Try to build on x86 again by creating a husk of a JDK which does not depend on itself

-- Replaced binaries and .so files with bash-stubs on i686
- added ExclusiveArch: %{java\_arches}
-- this now excludes i686
-- this is safely backport-able to older fedoras, as the macro was backported proeprly (with i686 included)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-e573851f56
2022-08-03 01:26:39.353802
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : java-latest-openjdk
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 18.0.2.0.9
Release : 1.rolling.fc36
URL : <http://openjdk.java.net/>
Summary : OpenJDK 18 Runtime Environment
Description :
The OpenJDK 18 runtime environment.

Security fixes \* JDK-8272243: Improve DER parsing - JDK-8272249: Better

subject handling - JDK-8283190: Improve MIDI processing - JDK-8284370:
Improve zlib usage - JDK-8285407, CVE-2022-34169: Improve Xalan supports ##
JDK-8288367: CPU Shares Ignored When Computing Active Processor Count Previous
JDK releases used an incorrect interpretation of the Linux cgroups parameter
`cpu.shares`. This might cause the JVM to use fewer CPUs than available, leading
to an under utilization of CPU resources when the JVM is used inside a
container. Starting from this JDK release, by default, the JVM no longer
considers `cpu.shares` when deciding the number of threads to be used by the
various thread pools. The `-XX:+UseContainerCpuShares` command-line option can
be used to revert to the previous behaviour. This option is deprecated and may
be removed in a future JDK release.

\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Jiri Vanek gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:18.0.1.1.2-8.rolling
- moved to build only on %{java\_arches}
-- <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_JDKs>
- reverted :
-- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild> (always mess up release)
-- Try to build on x86 again by creating a husk of a JDK which does not depend on itself
-- Exclude x86 from builds as the bootstrap JDK is now completely broken and unusable
-- Replaced binaries and .so files with bash-stubs on i686
- added ExclusiveArch: %{java\_arches}
-- this now excludes i686
-- this is safely backport-able to older fedoras, as the macro was backported properly (with i686 included)

2022-08-03 01:48:48.037712
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : java-11-openjdk

Version : 11.0.16.0.8
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <http://openjdk.java.net/>
Summary : OpenJDK 11 Runtime Environment
Description :
The OpenJDK 11 runtime environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

processing - JDK-8284370: Improve zlib usage - JDK-8285407, CVE-2022-34169:
Improve Xalan supports ## FIPS Changes \*
[RH2007331](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007331>): SecretKey
generate/import operations don't add the CKA\_SIGN attribute in FIPS mode \*
[RH2036462](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036462>):
sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.getInstance breakage \*
[RH2090378](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090378>): Revert to
disabling system security properties and FIPS mode support together \* Depend on
`crypto-policies` package at build-time and run-time ## Other Changes \* Add
javaver- and origin-specific javadoc and javadoczip alternatives (thanks to FeRD
(Frank Dana) ferdnyc@gmail.com) ## JDK-8285240: HTTPS Channel Binding support
for Java GSS/Kerberos Support has been added for TLS channel binding tokens for
Negotiate/Kerberos authentication over HTTPS through
`javax.net.HttpsURLConnection`. Channel binding tokens are increasingly
required as an enhanced form of security which can mitigate certain kinds of
socially engineered, man in the middle (MITM) attacks. They work by
communicating from a client to a server the client's understanding of the
binding between connection security (as represented by a TLS server cert) and
higher level authentication credentials (such as a username and password). The
server can then detect if the client has been fooled by a MITM and shutdown the
session/connection. The feature is controlled through a new system property
`jdk.https.negotiate.cbt` which is described fully at the following page:
<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc->
files/net-properties.html#jdk.https.negotiate.cbt ## JDK-8278386: Default JDK
compressor will be closed when IOException is encountered
`DeflaterOutputStream.close()` and `GZIPOutputStream.finish()` methods have been
modified to close out the associated default JDK compressor before propagating a
`Throwable` up the stack. `ZIPOutputStream.closeEntry()` method has been
modified to close out the associated default JDK compressor before propagating
an `IOException`, not of type `ZipException`, up the stack. ## JDK-8277157:
Vector should throw ClassNotFoundException for a missing class of an element
`java.util.Vector` is updated to correctly report `ClassNotFoundException that
occurs during deserialization using
`java.io.ObjectInputStream.GetField.get(name, object)` when the class of an
element of the Vector is not found. Without this fix, a
`StreamCorruptedException` is thrown that does not provide information about the
missing class.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

\* Fri Jul 22 2022 Jiri Vanek gnu.andrew@redhat.com - 1:1.8.0.342.b06-0.4.ea
- moved to build only on %{java\_arches}
-- <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_JDKs>
- reverted :
-- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild> (always mess up release)
-- Try to build on x86 again by creating a husk of a JDK which does not depend on itself
-- Exclude x86 from builds as the bootstrap JDK is now completely broken and unusable
-- Reinstate demo package on x86
-- Temporarily disable noarch status of javadoc and javadoc-zip so x86 can differ
-- Replaced binaries and .so files with bash-stubs on i686
- added ExclusiveArch: %{java\_arches}
-- this now excludes i686
-- this is safely backport-able to older fedoras, as the macro was backported proeprly (with i686 included)
