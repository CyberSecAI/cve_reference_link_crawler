- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Additional CSS" field allows users to input arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with administrative privileges can inject the malicious code through the plugin settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or editor level privileges on the WordPress site. The attacker also needs access to the plugin settings page.
