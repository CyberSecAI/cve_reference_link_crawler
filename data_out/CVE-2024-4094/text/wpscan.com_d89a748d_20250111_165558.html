## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Share Buttons Adder < 8.5.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin settings
2. In the "Additional CSS" field, enter the payload `</style><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`
3. Save settings and see the XSS when the page reloads

### Affects Plugins
