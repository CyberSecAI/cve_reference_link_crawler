**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The ThirstyAffiliates Affiliate Link Manager plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when creating affiliate links.
*   **Weakness:** Missing authorization and CSRF protection. This allows any authenticated user, including those with low privileges like subscribers, to create arbitrary affiliate links.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can create malicious affiliate links that redirect users to arbitrary websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other harmful activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `ta_process_quick_add_affiliate_link`.
