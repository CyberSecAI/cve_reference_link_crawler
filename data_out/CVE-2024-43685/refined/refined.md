    "related": true,
    "summary": "The TimeProvider® 4100 grandmaster is vulnerable to session hijacking.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The TimeProvider® 4100 grandmaster is vulnerable to session hijacking due to a session fixation vulnerability. The device provides a new cookie 'ci_session' before the login, which will then be used in the post-login session. An attacker able to obtain the cookie before the login, could use it to hijack the session.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Session fixation",
        "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of the vulnerability allows the attacker to hijack a user session if they are able to obtain a pre-login cookie.",
       "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker needs to obtain a valid session token and then induce a user to authenticate himself with that session token.",
          "An attacker can create a cookie with a chosen value (same length as the original one) performing a request for an unauthenticated resource."
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and be able to capture the session cookie."
