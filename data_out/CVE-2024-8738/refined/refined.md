### Summary
The provided content confirms the presence of a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Seriously Simple Stats WordPress plugin, versions 1.6.0 and below.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin uses the `add_query_arg` function without proper sanitization/escaping when constructing URLs, specifically within the `maybe_notify_stats_update` function (now removed in 1.7.0). This allows for the injection of malicious scripts via crafted query parameters in URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which are then executed in the victim's browser when the crafted link is accessed. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of websites
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of a user
    - Other malicious behavior

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user (typically an administrator) into clicking the crafted URL, which leads to script execution. This can be accomplished through social engineering, phishing, or other methods.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.6.0. It has been patched in version 1.7.0, which removes the vulnerable code paths and updates other features.
- The vulnerable code existed in a function meant to provide an admin notice about a database update, demonstrating an indirect attack surface.
- The vulnerable code can be traced to line 1296 in `seriously-simple-stats/trunk/php/classes/class-ssp-stats.php` (prior to the fix).
- The provided references to the Trac changeset and file browser point to the location of the vulnerable code and the code changes made to resolve the issue.
