### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-42367](https://redirect.github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-jwhx-xcg6-8xhj)

### Summary
Static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or
`.br` extension) were vulnerable to path traversal outside the root
directory if those variants are symbolic links.

### Details
The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root
directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default). It does this by
resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that
path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when
looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and
symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing
`Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

### Impact
Servers with static routes that contain compressed variants as symbolic

[CVE-2024-42367](https://redirect.github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-jwhx-xcg6-8xhj)

### Summary
Static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or
`.br` extension) were vulnerable to path traversal outside the root
directory if those variants are symbolic links.

### Details
The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root
directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default). It does this by
resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that
path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when
looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and
symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing
`Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

### Impact
Servers with static routes that contain compressed variants as symbolic
links, pointing outside the root directory, or that permit users to
upload or create such links, are impacted.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-42367](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwhx-xcg6-8xhj "CVE-2024-42367")](<https://redirect.github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-jwhx-xcg6-8xhj>)

### Summary
Static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or
`.br` extension) were vulnerable to path traversal outside the root
directory if those variants are symbolic links.

### Details
The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root
directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default). It does this by
resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that
path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when
looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and
symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing
`Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

### Impact
Servers with static routes that contain compressed variants as symbolic
links, pointing outside the root directory, or that permit users to
upload or create such links, are impacted.

\===================

## Bug fixes

- Fixed server checks for circular symbolic links to be compatible with
Python 3.13 -- by :user:`steverep`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8565`.

- Fixed request body not being read when ignoring an Upgrade request --
by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8597`.

- Fixed an edge case where shutdown would wait for timeout when the
handler was already completed -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8611`.

- Fixed connecting to `npipe://`, `tcp://`, and `unix://` urls -- by
:user:`bdraco`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8632`.

- Fixed WebSocket ping tasks being prematurely garbage collected -- by
:user:`bdraco`.

There was a small risk that WebSocket ping tasks would be prematurely
garbage collected because the event loop only holds a weak reference to
the task. The garbage collection risk has been fixed by holding a strong
reference to the task. Additionally, the task is now scheduled eagerly
with Python 3.12+ to increase the chance it can be completed immediately
and avoid having to hold any references to the task.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8641`.

- Fixed incorrectly following symlinks for compressed file variants --
by :user:`steverep`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8652`.

## Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes

- Removed `Request.wait_for_disconnection()`, which was mistakenly added
briefly in 3.10.0 -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8636`.

## Contributor-facing changes

- Fixed monkey patches for `Path.stat()` and `Path.is_dir()` for Python
3.13 compatibility -- by :user:`steverep`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8551`.

## Miscellaneous internal changes

- Improved WebSocket performance when messages are sent or received
frequently -- by :user:`bdraco`.

The WebSocket heartbeat scheduling algorithm was improved to reduce the
`asyncio` scheduling overhead by decreasing the number of
`asyncio.TimerHandle` creations and cancellations.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8608`.

- Minor improvements to various type annotations -- by
:user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

    *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
    :issue:`8634`.
