    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The server does not perform path traversal checks when looking for compressed file variants in the `FileResponse` class. When serving static files, if a compressed variant (.gz or .br) of a file exists as a symbolic link, the server will automatically follow the symbolic link when performing `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()`. This bypasses the intended path traversal protection, which only checks the resolved path relative to the root when `follow_symlinks=False`.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Incorrect symlink handling"

      "impact": "An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files outside of the intended static file directory. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Create a symbolic link to a target file outside of the static directory, and give the link the same name as the requested resource with a '.gz' or '.br' suffix.",
         "Access a static route file via a crafted path using compressed variants as symlinks."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or upload a symbolic link within the static file directory, or have prior knowledge of vulnerable symlinks present in the directory."
