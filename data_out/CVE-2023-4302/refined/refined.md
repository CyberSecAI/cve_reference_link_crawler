  "vulnerability_1": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2023-4302",
    "Root cause": "The Fortify Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.",
    "Weaknesses": "Missing permission checks.",
    "Impact": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.",
     "Attack vectors": "HTTP endpoints that do not have permission checks.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Overall/Read permission, and attacker-specified credential IDs (obtained through another method)"
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2023-4301",
   "Root cause": "The Fortify Plugin does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)",
    "Impact": "Attackers can trigger actions via the vulnerable HTTP endpoint.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP endpoints that do not require POST requests.",
     "Required attacker capabilities":"No specific capabilities needed, other than the ability to trigger an HTTP request."
