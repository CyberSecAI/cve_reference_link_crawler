  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "The Edwiser Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the user_data_synchronization_initiater(), course_synchronization_initiater(), users_link_to_moodle_synchronization(), connection_test_initiater(), admin_menus(), and subscribe_handler() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
    "root_cause": "The plugin fails to properly validate nonces, which are security tokens used to protect against CSRF attacks, in several functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Missing nonce validation",
      "Incorrect nonce validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can perform unauthorized actions by tricking a site administrator into clicking a crafted link or performing an unintended action. This could potentially lead to unauthorized data synchronization, changes in settings, or other malicious activities within the WordPress plugin.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a forged web request. An attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when clicked or submitted by an authenticated user (typically a site administrator), triggers an action on the WordPress site without the user's consent.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (site administrator) into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link or submitting a forged form."
