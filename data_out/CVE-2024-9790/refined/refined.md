```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter in several admin panel files, before using it in SQL queries.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability is present in LyLme_spage v1.9.5. The application filters some SQL keywords (e.g., group_concat) but can be bypassed.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. They can also enumerate database structure using techniques like querying information_schema.tables, and use sleep() function for time based attacks.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests to specific admin panel files (/admin/tag.php, /admin/apply.php, /admin/sou.php) by modifying the 'id' parameter in the request URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They do not need prior authentication.
