Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `id` parameter in the `partedit.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive System Control:**  Successful exploitation may lead to complete control over the system and potentially service interruption

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `partedit.php` file, with the malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id` in `partedit.php`.
- Time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query techniques can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- Example payloads are provided, demonstrating time-based blind injection (`id=52' AND (SELECT 5847 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Ldfy) AND 'Jiei'='Jiei`) and UNION query injection (`id=-8311' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71717a7071,0x516a426e776272716a736e556b64507a446154584457435048494a597a74704973776a7169755855,0x71787a6a71),NULL-- -`).
- The vulnerability affects "Itsourcecode Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0".

**Mitigation:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement strict input validation and filtering.
- Minimize database user permissions.
- Conduct regular security audits.
