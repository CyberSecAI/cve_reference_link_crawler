- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Logo Scheduler plugin, versions 1.2.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts are then executed when a user visits the site, potentially leading to user compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin, where a malicious actor injects scripts into the website via the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
