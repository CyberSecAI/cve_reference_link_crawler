The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4981.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `addcslashes` for escaping user-provided input in several files (`includes/html/common/eventlog.inc.php`, `includes/html/common/syslog.inc.php`, `includes/html/pages/eventlog.inc.php`, `includes/html/pages/syslog.inc.php`), which was found to be insufficient to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The code was using `addcslashes` to escape user-provided data which was insufficient to prevent XSS.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper output encoding allowed for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement of the application, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-provided input within the LibreNMS application, specifically in the event log and syslog functionalities, that is not properly sanitized before being included in HTML output.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to introduce malicious input into the system, likely through request parameters such as `eventtype`, `device`, `program`, `priority`, `to`, or `from`, which are used within event log and syslog functionalities. The attacker would also need to have an account or be in a position to influence the values of these parameters.
