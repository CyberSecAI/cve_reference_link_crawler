The provided content details three vulnerabilities in go2rtc, with CVE-2024-29192 corresponding to the second issue described: Cross-site scripting in `index.html`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `index.html` page fetches data from the `/api/streams` endpoint and iterates over the results, using the stream name in the HTML content without sanitization. Specifically, the `name` property from the JSON response is directly inserted into the `innerHTML` of table cells in `index.html`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   DOM-based Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insecure use of `innerHTML`. The application does not sanitize the `name` value from the JSON response of the `/api/streams` API endpoint before inserting it directly into the `innerHTML` of the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the `index.html` page. This allows them to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser when they visit the page. This can potentially lead to account compromise, data theft, and further malicious actions against the victim.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can create a malicious stream name via PUT request to the `/api/streams` endpoint, injecting malicious HTML code as a part of the stream `name` property. When a user visits the `index.html` page, the injected code will be executed in their browser as the page displays all the existing streams.
*   A drive-by attack is also possible, where an attacker sets up a server that automatically sends the crafted request to create a malicious stream and redirects the victim to the vulnerable go2rtc instance, causing the XSS to trigger when the user accesses the `index.html` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the go2rtc instance. They either need to be able to directly send requests to the API or convince a victim to visit a page that does so, thus performing a drive-by attack.
*   The attacker needs to know that the go2rtc instance is running.
