{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of loose comparison operators (`!=`) instead of strict comparison operators (`!==`) in the `verify_id_token` function when comparing the `aud` (audience) and `iss` (issuer) claims within the Firebase ID token.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to loose comparison.",
      "Insecure handling of Firebase ID tokens."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can potentially log in as any existing user, including administrators, if they can obtain a Firebase ID token with a matching project ID and a valid `phone_number` claim.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting the loose comparison in the `verify_id_token` function, which is used to authenticate users via Firebase phone authentication.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the following capabilities:\n\n1.  Access to a valid Firebase ID token.\n2.  The targeted WordPress site must have Firebase configured.\n3.  The user must have set up Firebase for their account.\n4.  Access to a valid `@flutter.io` email address or phone number (as indicated by the Wordfence article, although this seems to be a side condition and not a requirement)."
