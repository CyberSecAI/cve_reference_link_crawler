The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29038.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP do not obfuscate password reminder answers. This means that the answers are displayed in plain text rather than being masked or encrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of obfuscation of password reminder answers. This allows for the exposure of sensitive information (the password reminder answers).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially steal a user's password reminder answers through:
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Intercepting network traffic containing the password reminder answers while a user is setting or viewing them.
*   **Shoulder surfing attacks:** Visually observing the user's screen while they are entering or viewing the password reminder answers.
Once the attacker has the answer to the password reminder question, they might be able to gain unauthorized access to the account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Traffic Interception (MITM):** An attacker positioned on the network path between a user and the Liferay server can intercept the network traffic.
*   **Physical proximity (Shoulder surfing):** An attacker can physically look at the user's screen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** For MITM attacks, the attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic, typically by being on the same network or controlling a network device in the traffic path.
*   **Proximity:** For shoulder surfing, the attacker needs to be physically close to the user when they are interacting with the password reminder functionality.
*  **User Interaction:** User has to either be setting a new password reminder or viewing current ones for the vulnerability to be exploited.
