## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Smart Forms < 2.6.96 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new form or edit an existing form
2. In the CSS field, enter the payload `</script><script>alert(/XSS: CSS/)</script>`. In the "After Submit" section, enter the payload `<script>alert(/XSS: after submit alert /)</script>` for the "Show Alert Message".
3. View the form and then see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
