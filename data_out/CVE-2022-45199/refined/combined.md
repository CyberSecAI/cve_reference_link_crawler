### @hugovk **[hugovk](/hugovk)** commented [Oct 29, 2022](#issue-1428170606)

A large value in the `SAMPLESPERPIXEL` tag could lead to a memory and runtime DOS in `TiffImagePlugin.py` when setting up the context for image decoding.

This was introduced in Pillow 9.2.0, found with [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) and fixed by limiting `SAMPLESPERPIXEL` to the number of planes that we can decode.

Sorry, something went wrong.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | A large value in the ``SAMPLESPERPIXEL`` tag could lead to a memory and runtime DOS in |
|  |  | ``TiffImagePlugin.py`` when setting up the context for image decoding. |
|  |  | This was introduced in Pillow 9.2.0, found with `OSS-Fuzz`\_ and fixed by limiting |
|  |  | ``SAMPLESPERPIXEL`` to the number of planes that we can decode. |
