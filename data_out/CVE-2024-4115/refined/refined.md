Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formAddDnsForward` function in Tenda W15Ev1.0 firmware is vulnerable to a stack overflow.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `DnsForwardRule` parameter.
- The firmware version affected is V15.11.0.14.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack.
- This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `formAddDnsForward` function.
- The attacker would need to manipulate the `DnsForwardRule` parameter to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the `/goform/AddDnsForward` endpoint with a specially crafted `DnsForwardRule` parameter.
- It is likely the attacker would need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, or have the ability to send requests to the device's web interface.
