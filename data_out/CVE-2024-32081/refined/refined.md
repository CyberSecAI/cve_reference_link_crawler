- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user (Subscriber) could execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that they should not be able to. The specific impact can vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly defined, but it involves a user with 'Subscriber' level privileges exploiting a function lacking proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (low privilege user) of the vulnerable WordPress site.
