| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2226784#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-26 14:13:58 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds read issue was found in the Linux kernel in the u32_match_it() function, which is used to match packet content under netfilter. This flaw requires CAP_NET_ADMIN to be exploited and could lead to information disclosure.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2226784#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-10-09 07:41:11 UTC  ``` ZDI security advisory: <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-18408/>  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/69c5d284f67089b4750d28ff6ac6f52ec224b330>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2226784#c11)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-10-09 14:39:32 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2242876](show_bug.cgi?id=2242876 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-39192 kernel: netfilter: xtables out-of-bounds read in u32_match_it() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2226784#c12)  Justin M.
