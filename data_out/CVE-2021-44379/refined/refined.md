- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` application incorrectly assumes that the "param" field within a JSON request will always be a JSON object. It uses the subscription operator to access elements within the "param" field, which leads to an assertion failure when it receives a non-object value (e.g., an empty string). This assertion failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, resulting in a device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20). The application lacks proper checks to ensure that the "param" field is a JSON object before attempting to access its members.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the camera to reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint of the Reolink camera. The malicious request includes a JSON payload in the request body where the `param` field is not a JSON object, such as an empty string (`""`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera. While most of the vulnerable APIs require an authenticated session, it's also possible to exploit this issue unauthenticated, by using another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420).
