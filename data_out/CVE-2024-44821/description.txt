ZZCMS 2023 contains a vulnerability in the captcha reuse logic located in /inc/function.php. The checkyzm function does not properly refresh the captcha value after a failed validation attempt. As a result, an attacker can exploit this flaw by repeatedly submitting the same incorrect captcha response, allowing them to capture the correct captcha value through error messages.
