The content is related to CVE-2023-47628.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DataHub Frontend uses Play Framework's default stateless session settings which do not set an expiration time for the session cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stateless session cookies without expiration
- Session cookies not invalidated upon logout
- Use of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework combined with default settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who obtains a valid session cookie can use it indefinitely, regardless of when it was created, to impersonate the legitimate user, accessing the system with their privileges. This compromises the confidentiality of the user's data and allows for potential data modification.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they can obtain a valid session cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid `PLAY_SESSION` cookie from an authenticated user through any means possible.
- The attacker can use the cookie without the need of knowing the user credentials.
- No privileges are required.
- Requires user interaction (the user needs to login to generate the session token).
