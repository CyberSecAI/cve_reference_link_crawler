# Session Expiration Misconfiguration

Moderate

[david-leifker](/david-leifker)
published
GHSA-75p8-rgh2-r9mx
Nov 13, 2023

## Package

docker

datahub-frontend
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< v0.11.1

## Patched versions

v0.11.1

## Description

### Summary

DataHub Frontend's sessions are configured using Play Framework's default settings for stateless session which do not set an expiration time for a cookie. Due to this, if a session cookie were ever leaked, it would be valid forever.

### Details

DataHub uses a stateless session cookie that is not invalidated on logout, it is just removed from the browser forcing the user to login again. However, if an attacker extracted a cookie from an authenticated user it would continue to be valid as there is no validation on a time window the session token is valid for due to a combination of the usage of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework and using default settings which do not set an expiration time.

### PoC

Take a PLAY\_SESSION cookie from an expired session and attempt to use it with a curl request with other proper headers set, the cookie will be accepted as valid despite any length of time passing.

### Impact

All DataHub instances prior to the patch will accept any session token created at any point in time as valid for the user it is valid for.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
