The CombinerExecutor class creates an instance of FastThreadLocal for each combiner executor leading to an increase of the InternalThreadLocalMap index. Consequently each thread local map of FastThreadLocalThread will get a new map sized accordingly, leading to an eventual memory leak.

Use a static FastThreadLocal in CombinerExecutor instead of a instance field, the data structure stored in this thread local map keeps track of the CombinerExecutor running in order to allow interleaved execution of CombinerExecutor post tasks without interfering each other. The structure is optimized for the most frequent case.

Fixes <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1023>

Sorry, something went wrong.
