| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2024-01-29 11:01:27 UTC  ``` There is a regression in Vert.x 4.4 branch that leads to a memory leak due to the use of Netty FastThreadLocal data structures.  As a consequence, when the Vert.x HTTP client connects to a different host, it does make the leak progress furthermore, there might be other cases leading to the same effect but exhibiting one seems enough to demonstrate the feasability.  Thus, this can be exploited with intimate knowledge of the runtime to accelerate the memory leak, e.g. a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses for which it will connect to could be fed with addresses as an attack vector.  This affects the maven artifact io.vertx:vertx-core versions 4.4.5, 4.4.6, 4.5.0, 4.5.1  <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/issues/5078> <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5082> <https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/5080>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-03 10:53:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11  Via RHSA-2024:1662 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1662](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1662)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-29 02:26:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Cryostat 2 on RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:2088 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2088](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2088)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-14 09:08:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHINT Service Registry 2.5.11 GA  Via RHSA-2024:2833 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2833](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2833)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-30 20:25:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.7.0  Via RHSA-2024:3527 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3527](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3527)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-20 00:35:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    MTA-6.2-RHEL-9   MTA-6.2-RHEL-8  Via RHSA-2024:3989 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3989](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3989)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2260840#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-25 19:26:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot  Via RHSA-2024:4884 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4884](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4884)   ``` |  |
