Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the initial setup menus on many Lexmark devices not restricting access to the "Firmware Updates" feature. This lack of access control allows unauthenticated users to interact with this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authentication and authorization checks for the "Firmware Updates" feature during the initial device setup. This allows unauthorized access.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to interact with the firmware update feature without needing to authenticate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firmware Downgrade:** Successful exploitation results in the ability to downgrade the device's firmware to an older version.
*   **Exposure to Older Vulnerabilities:** Downgrading the firmware exposes the device to known security vulnerabilities present in the older firmware version that may have been patched in the newer versions.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** This downgrade could be a stepping stone for further malicious activities and potentially complete compromise of the printer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network access, as the device's web page (embedded web server) is used to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Unauthenticated Requests:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending requests to the device's web server without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Lexmark device.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not require any credentials or prior access to the device to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Requests:** The attacker would need to know how to interact with web servers, which can be fairly low skilled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also provides workarounds for both older and newer devices. These mitigations involves modifying the access control settings for the 'Firmware Updates' function through the device's embedded web server.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Lexmark through Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Lexmark assigned a CVSSv3 base score of 7.5 for the vulnerability, indicating high severity. The CVSS vector is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) which indicates a high impact to integrity.
