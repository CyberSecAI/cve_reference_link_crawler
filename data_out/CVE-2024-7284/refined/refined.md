The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Lot Reservation Management System, version 1.0. This vulnerability is present in the `/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` endpoint.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving site settings. Specifically, the `name` parameter within the POST request is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` with a specially crafted payload in the `name` parameter.
- This request is sent through the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings`.
- The attacker may need to be logged in to the application as an administrator.
