- **Root cause of vulnerability:** NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software dereferences a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Application denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requires low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges are required (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to convince the user to open a malicious file or perform a specific action.
