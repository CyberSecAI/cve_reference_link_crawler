# HTCONDOR-2021-0003 [CVE-2021-45101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45101)

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| Using standard command-line tools, a user with only READ access to a SchedD or Collector can discover secrets that could allow them to control other users jobs and/or read their data. | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | SchedD, Collector | All Versions | All Platforms | Not known to be publicly exploited | 8.8.14, 9.0.3, 9.1.1 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | READ access to HTCondor daemons | Any | Medium | High | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2021-07-27 | Jaime Frey | | |
| Access Required: | READ access to HTCondor daemons |
| An attacker need only have READ-level authorization to a vulnerable daemon. This means they are able to run tools like condor\_q or condor\_status. Many pools do not require authentication for READ-level commands so it is likely that an attacker could execute this command remotely from an untrusted network, unless otherwise prevented by a firewall or other network-level access controls. | |
| Effort Required: | Medium |
| An attacker would need to write custom tools and be very familiar with the HTCondor wire protocols to carry out a succesful attack. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | High |
| This attack allows a user to control a running job submitted by another user. This could let them read that job's data and/or inject their own executables into that job that would then run as that user. | |
| Workaround: |
| There is no workaround for this issue. | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |
