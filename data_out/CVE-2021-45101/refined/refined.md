Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of a user with only READ access to HTCondor daemons (SchedD or Collector) to discover secrets. These secrets can be leveraged to control other users' jobs and/or read their data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is that read access to the SchedD or Collector daemons is enough to expose sensitive information. This indicates that the system is not properly sanitizing or restricting the information provided to read-only users.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The vulnerability exposes secrets which allows an attacker to impersonate or control other users jobs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Job Control:** An attacker can take control of a running job submitted by another user.
*   **Data Access:** The attacker can read the data associated with the compromised job.
*   **Code Injection:** The attacker can inject their own executables into the targeted user's job, which would then execute with that user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely from an untrusted network, assuming no firewalls or other network-level access controls are in place to restrict such access.
*   **Command-Line Tools:** The attack can be initiated using standard command-line tools like `condor_q` or `condor_status`. These tools typically provide read-level access to HTCondor daemons.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **READ Access:** The attacker needs only READ-level authorization to a vulnerable HTCondor daemon (SchedD or Collector).
*   **Technical Familiarity:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the HTCondor wire protocols.
*  **Custom Tooling:** The attacker would need to develop custom tools to carry out a successful attack.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of HTCondor
* The document states that the issue is not known to have been publicly exploited, and a fix is available in versions 8.8.14, 9.0.3, and 9.1.1.
* No workarounds exist for the issue.
* Full details were embargoed at the time of writing
