- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management due to exploiting interprocess communication between different processes in NVIDIA ChatRTX for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management (CWE-269)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure, escalation of privileges, and data tampering
- **Attack vectors**: Local access (AV:L), low privileges (PR:L), no user interaction needed (UI:N). The attack involves exploiting interprocess communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access and low privileges on the system. They also need to be able to manipulate interprocess communication.
