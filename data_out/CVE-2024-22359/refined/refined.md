- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to alteration of intended functionality and potentially to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI, where a malicious user can inject JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI, indicating they might need to be a user with specific permissions or roles, but this isn't specified.
