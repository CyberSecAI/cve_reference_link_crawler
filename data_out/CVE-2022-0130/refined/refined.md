- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- The attack complexity is high.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a specific file type in the web server root of the target Tenable.sc host.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional details:**
