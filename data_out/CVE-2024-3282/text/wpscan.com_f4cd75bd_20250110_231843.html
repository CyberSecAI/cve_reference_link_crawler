## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Table Builder <= 1.5.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Table data, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1) Allow Subscribers to use the plugin through the settings.
2) As an administrator, create a post and use the WP Table Builder block to create a table from an empty template, add a text field to it. Take note of the Table's ID number.
3) Log back as a subscriber, and navigate to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wptb-builder&table=$TABLE\_ID
4) Start a request interceptor like Burp Suite, and click on "Save".
4) Edit the request to add the following code within the table: <svg onload='alert(/XSS/)'>
5) Submit the request. Visiting the previously safe post will now trigger an alert.
