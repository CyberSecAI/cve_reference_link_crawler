- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape table data, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via table data within the plugin. The malicious code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected table.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the capability to use the plugin (e.g. subscriber) and manipulate table data. Additionally, the attacker needs a way to modify the table data, such as by intercepting and editing a request with a tool like Burp Suite.
