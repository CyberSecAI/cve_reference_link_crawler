{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The LB-LINK BL-W1210M router does not enforce strong password complexity requirements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient password complexity requirements"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass password complexity requirements and set single digit passwords. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the router through brute-force attacks.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Brute-force attack"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the router's login page. An attacker may leverage a Base64 credential cracking technique."
