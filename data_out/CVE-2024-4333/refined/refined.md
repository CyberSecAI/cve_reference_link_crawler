    "cveId": "CVE-2024-4333",
    "description": "The Sina Extension for Elementor (Slider, Gallery, Form, Modal, Data Table, Tab, Particle, Free Elementor Widgets & Elementor Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 3.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
  },
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of several parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Plugin parameters within the WordPress admin interface."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher."

    "affectedSoftware": {
    "name": "Sina Extension for Elementor",
    "versions": "<= 3.5.3",
    "patchedVersion": "3.5.4"
  },
    "additionalNotes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.5.4 by implementing proper escaping using functions like `esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `sina_ext_escape_tags`, and `sina_ext_escape_in_anims`.",
        "The vulnerable code was present in multiple files across the plugin, impacting several widgets like Banner Slider, Contact Form, Content Slider, Countdown, Mailchimp Subscribe, News Ticker, Particle Layer, Portfolio, Review Carousel, Fancytext, Piechart, Pricing, Progressbar, Table, Team, Title, User Counter, and Visit Counter.",
    "The fixes involved modifying how user-supplied data was handled before being output to the page, effectively preventing XSS attacks by encoding special characters."
