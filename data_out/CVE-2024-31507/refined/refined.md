Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insufficient protection of the "request" parameter in the `admin/fetch_gendercs.php` file of the Online Graduate Tracer System for College of ICT Alumni in PHP Free Source Code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `request` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the extraction of sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable script.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by manipulating the `request` parameter within the HTTP POST request to `admin/fetch_gendercs.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter**: The attacker must know that the "request" parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `admin/fetch_gendercs.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `request`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using `sqlmap`, as demonstrated by the provided PoC.
*   Several SQL injection techniques were used to demonstrate exploitation (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query).
*   A sample Burp Suite request was provided to demonstrate a typical exploitation attempt.
