riscv, bpf: Fix potential NULL dereference

The bpf_jit_binary_free() function requires a non-NULL argument. When
the RISC-V BPF JIT fails to converge in NR_JIT_ITERATIONS steps,
jit_data->header will be NULL, which triggers a NULL
dereference. Avoid this by checking the argument, prior calling the
function.
