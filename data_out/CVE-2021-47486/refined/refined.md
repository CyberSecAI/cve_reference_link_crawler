Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-47486

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing NULL check before calling the `bpf_jit_binary_free()` function in the RISC-V BPF JIT compiler. Specifically, when the JIT fails to converge within a certain number of iterations (`NR_JIT_ITERATIONS`), the `jit_data->header` pointer can be NULL. The `bpf_jit_binary_free()` function expects a non-NULL argument, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference when called with a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. When `jit_data->header` is NULL, attempting to access the memory it points to within the `bpf_jit_binary_free()` function causes a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation leads to a kernel crash and a denial of service.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, a NULL pointer dereference in kernel space can sometimes be leveraged for privilege escalation in certain scenarios, though this is not directly evident in this instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Triggering JIT Failure:** The vulnerability is triggered by causing the RISC-V BPF JIT compiler to fail to converge. This would involve providing BPF bytecode to the kernel that would cause the JIT compilation to exceed `NR_JIT_ITERATIONS`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to load BPF programs:** An attacker must be able to load a crafted BPF program into the kernel. This usually requires some level of privilege or access depending on the system configuration and security policies in place.
- **Targeting RISC-V architecture:** This vulnerability is specific to the RISC-V architecture.
- **Knowledge of BPF limitations**: To reliably trigger the non-convergence, the attacker must have some understanding of the BPF JIT compilation process, and its convergence characteristics.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix implemented in the patch involves adding a conditional check to ensure `bpf_jit_binary_free()` is only called when `jit_data->header` is not NULL:
    ```c
     if (i == NR_JIT_ITERATIONS) {
         pr_err("bpf-jit: image did not converge in <%d passes!\n", i);
-        bpf_jit_binary_free(jit_data->header);
+       if (jit_data->header)
+           bpf_jit_binary_free(jit_data->header);
        prog = orig_prog;
        goto out_offset;
     }
    ```
