Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Contact Form 7 Newsletter plugin for WordPress, versions 2.2 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means there is a flaw in the plugin that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, which allows for the injection of arbitrary scripts into the website. This is a common vulnerability type and the description refers to it as "Cross Site Scripting (XSS)".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - A successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of website visitors.
    -  These malicious scripts can perform actions such as:
        - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
        - Displaying unwanted advertisements.
        - Stealing cookies or other sensitive data.
        - Performing other HTML payload injections.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin. The specific method of injection (e.g., through a form field, URL parameter, etc.) is not specified in the provided information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning anyone can potentially trigger this vulnerability if they can send malicious code that the vulnerable plugin does not sanitize correctly.
    - The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the website.
