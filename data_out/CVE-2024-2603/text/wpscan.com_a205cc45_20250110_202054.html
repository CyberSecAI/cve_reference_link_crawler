## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Salon booking system < 9.6.6 - Editor+ Stored XSS via Email Settings

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin (or editor depending on plugin configuration) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Salon > Settings"
2. Under "General > Salon Information" scroll down to "Email Notifications Service"
3. For "Customize the booking reminder message" enter the payload: `</textarea><script>alert(/XSS: salon\_settings[booking\_update\_message]/)</script>`
4. Click "Update Settings"
5. Go to "Salon > Booking" and open a booking to see the XSS
