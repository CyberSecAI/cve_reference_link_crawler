- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its email settings. Specifically, the "Customize the booking reminder message" field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (such as admin or editor, depending on the plugin configuration) can inject the malicious code via the plugin's settings page. The malicious script is then triggered when a user views a booking.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a high privileged account (admin or editor) in the WordPress instance and access to the "Salon > Settings" page.
