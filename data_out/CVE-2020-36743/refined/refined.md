Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass in WordPress plugins, and specifically mentions "Product Catalog Simple":

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper implementation of nonce verification in multiple WordPress plugins, including "Product Catalog Simple". The code checks for the existence of a nonce before verifying it. If the nonce is missing in the request, the verification is skipped, allowing an attacker to bypass the CSRF protection. The vulnerability is caused by using conditional logic, where the nonce check is only executed when the nonce is present in the request, instead of always checking the nonce if the action is performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to CSRF attacks. The plugins fail to validate the authenticity of the requests, leaving the plugin open to malicious state-changing requests initiated by attackers.
- **Improper Nonce Handling:**  The core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of nonce checks.  The code uses `isset()` or `!empty()` checks combined with `&&` operator before `wp_verify_nonce`, leading to bypasses when the nonce is not present in the request.
- **Missing Nonce Validation:** The nonce is checked only if it is present in the request, instead of always checking the nonce to ensure a valid request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend.
- **Data Manipulation:** Exploitation could allow unauthorized changes in the product settings/metadata in the case of Product Catalog Simple, or to other plugin settings/data in the other listed plugins.
- **Potential for XSS or other attacks:**  The blog mentions that some vulnerabilities can lead to stored or reflected XSS, settings changes, configuration import, and modification of data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would use social engineering techniques to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking a crafted link/form that submits a forged request to the vulnerable site.
- **Forged Requests:**  The attacker crafts a malicious request targeting the vulnerable plugin's functionality. This request is then triggered by the administrator's browser when the user is tricked into taking action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to know that a specific plugin has a CSRF vulnerability.
- **Ability to craft a malicious request:** The attacker must be able to create a request that manipulates the vulnerable plugin.
- **Target User logged in:** The attacker needs to target a logged-in administrator of the WordPress website in order to perform an action on their behalf.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the administrator into taking some action, such as clicking on a malicious link/form.

**Specific Details of the Product Catalog Simple Vulnerability:**

The Wordfence article provides a specific description of the vulnerability in "Product Catalog Simple," explicitly stating that the `implecode_save_products_meta()` function lacks proper nonce validation and refers to blog.nintechnet.com as a reference. This confirms that the identified CSRF vulnerability in "Product Catalog Simple" is due to improper nonce handling, as described above.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes references to multiple articles from the same source (blog.nintechnet.com), which describe similar CSRF vulnerabilities in other plugins, and indicates the author discovered this class of vulnerabilities in various WordPress plugins.
- The blog posts mention the issue was reported to plugin authors or the WordPress plugin team, and that the identified issues were fixed by the authors.

The information clearly relates to CVE-2020-36743 as it describes a CSRF vulnerability in a WordPress plugin with missing/incorrect nonce validation, the cause of CVE-2020-36743 according to the Wordfence article.
