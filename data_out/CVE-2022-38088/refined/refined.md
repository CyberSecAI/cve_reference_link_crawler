{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `downfile.cgi` script takes an input `_filename` parameter from a HTTP request, and uses it to construct a file path without proper sanitization before using it in a file system call. The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) into the filename and read arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file read. An attacker can read any file on the file system accessible by the web server.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the `/downfile.cgi` endpoint. The request must contain a `_filename` parameter with directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running on the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD device. Valid authentication credentials are also required."
