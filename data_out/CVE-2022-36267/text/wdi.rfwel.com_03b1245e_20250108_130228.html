Easy and Reliable Wireless Broadband Access
CPE-CBSD, Rugged, CAT12, 18 dBi Outdoor CPE

Part of Airspan’s end-to-end CBRS solution, the AirSpot 5410 is an advanced, LTE, CAT12, outdoor, multi-service
product specifically designed to meet data needs for residential, business and enterprise users. Supporting
Gigabit networking functionality and multiple TDD band operations, it enables wide-coverage and high-data
throughput. Multiple operator network support can allow deployment across the country with different operators.
The AirSpot 5410 provides a Gigabit PoE connection to connect user terminal devices, such as a router or WiFi
AP products. It is CAT-B CBSD FCC and SAS compliant.

Rugged and Reliable
Built for the outdoors, with an IP67 rating, it can safely operate in
temperatures ranging from -40º to 65º C.

High Performance
Depending on the configuration and traffic split, the unit can provide up
to 600 Mbps download speeds and increased cell edge with its internal,
high-gain, 18 dBi antennas.

Easy to Use
Once connected to a CBSD, simply connect it to a computer, switch or
router, and it’s ready to go. Eight LED’s easily communicate the status,
and IP addresses are dynamically obtained via its internal DHCP.

Easy to Manage
Supports local management access, Telnet, HTTP, HTTPS and standard
TR069 remote OTA management, including device configuration,
monitoring, and upgrades management. Firmware upgrades can be
done from a pre-configured URL using HTTP/FTP.

Advanced Technology
Based on 3GPP standard implementation of LTE CAT12 specifications, it
can easily meet requirements of large service providers. Supports up to
4CA DL and 2CA UL, MIMO capabilities, 64QAM modulation (uplink),
and 256QAM modulation (downlink).
