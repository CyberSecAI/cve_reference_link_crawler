  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-32510",
      "root_cause": "The Nuki Bridge exposes the HTTP API through an unencrypted channel, allowing access to an administrative interface.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Sensitive information sent over an unencrypted channel"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can passively gather communication between the HTTP API and a client after accessing any device connected to the local network. A malicious actor can conveniently impersonate a legit user and access the full set of API endpoints.",
      "attack_vector": "Network-based attack. An attacker with local network access can intercept the unencrypted communications.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the Nuki Bridge."
