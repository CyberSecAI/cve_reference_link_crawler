- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing high-privilege users to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's settings page within the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges or other high-level permissions to access and modify the plugin's settings. The attack requires the user to access the settings page after it's saved.
