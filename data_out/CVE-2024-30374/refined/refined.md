- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of KSP files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a malicious KSP file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious KSP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious KSP file or a malicious page that would cause the user to load and process such a file. The user must interact with this malicious content for the exploit to occur.
