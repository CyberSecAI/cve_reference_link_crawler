The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2024-22815.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the communication protocol of the Tormach xsTECH CNC Router, specifically how it handles commands sent to the machine's memory (Torstep board).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect Access Control: The system lacks proper access control over commands sent to the machine's memory. This allows for the manipulation of these commands.
- Crafted commands: The system is vulnerable to crafted or manipulated commands, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The crafted commands can cause the CNC router to crash, interrupting normal operations.
- Physical Damage: The crafted commands can cause erratic movement of the spindle, even while the machine is idle, potentially leading to physical damage to the machine or surrounding environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves sending manipulated write commands to the machine's memory (Torstep board).
- Fuzzing: Attackers can use fuzzing techniques with manipulated commands to trigger crashes during the design process and disrupt operations.
- Spindle manipulation: Attackers can send commands to move the spindle while the machine is idle, posing a safety risk and causing physical damage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote access: The attacker needs to have remote network access to the Tormach xsTECH CNC Router.
- Ability to send commands: The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted commands over the network to the CNC router.
