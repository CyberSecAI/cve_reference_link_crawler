- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly uses the `$_POST` array to insert or update user data in the database without any sanitization or filtering of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's database record. This code will be executed when the user data is displayed in the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP POST request to `/admin/user/addpost.html` with a crafted `user_login` field containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected endpoint, typically requiring access to the administrative interface.
