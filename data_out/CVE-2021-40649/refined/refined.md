Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40649:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper configuration of HTTP cookies in the CONNX software. Specifically, the `TSWAAuthClientSideCookie` is being set without the `HttpOnly` flag.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on the `TSWAAuthClientSideCookie` makes it accessible to client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, running in the user's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript into a user's session (through a different vulnerability), that script could then access the `TSWAAuthClientSideCookie`. This cookie may contain sensitive information, such as authentication tokens. By accessing this token, an attacker could potentially impersonate the legitimate user, gain unauthorized access to resources, or perform other malicious actions on their behalf.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious JavaScript into the user's browser session. This could be through another vulnerability in the application or by tricking the user into clicking a malicious link.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to inject and execute JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session. This is typically done through XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the application's internals, the vulnerability is exposed via HTTP responses.
    * The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to visit a page with the malicious JavaScript.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CONNX Version 6.2.0.1269 (20210623).
*   The vulnerable cookie is named `TSWAAuthClientSideCookie`.
*   A `TSWAAuthHttpOnlyCookie` is correctly set with the `HttpOnly` flag, which mitigates the same vulnerability, however the `TSWAAuthClientSideCookie` is still vulnerable.

**Additional Notes**

* The content from connx.com does not directly mention the CVE or the vulnerability. It is more of a general overview of the company's products.
* The content from github.com provides specific details about the vulnerability, including the vulnerable cookie name, the lack of the HttpOnly flag, and example HTTP response headers, which is all useful information not provided in a basic CVE description.
