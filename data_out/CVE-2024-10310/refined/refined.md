Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10310

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'image\_title' parameter within the Custom Gallery Widget of the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input for the image title, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored within the WordPress database. These scripts execute in the context of the user's browser when the affected page is visited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user who views a page containing the malicious gallery widget. This could lead to:
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive user information.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Impersonating a legitimate user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or installing malware on their devices.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying content or functionality of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network via the WordPress website.
*   **Web:** Malicious script is injected through the plugin's user interface within the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level access.
*   **Access to Plugin Feature:**  The attacker must have the ability to create or edit pages using the "Custom Gallery Widget" within the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability lies specifically in the `custom-gallery.php` file within the `modules/custom-gallery/widgets` directory of the plugin.
*   **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `image_title`, which is part of the Custom Gallery widget's settings.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.10.2 by using `wp_kses` to sanitize the input rather than just `esc_html`. The `element_pack_allow_tags( 'text' )` likely specifies the allowed HTML tags for the image title, limiting the scope of potential XSS.
