SUMMARY

Microsoft has released updates for several versions of Microsoft Windows, which ﬁx vulnerabilities in the
Remote Desktop Service that are discussed under the name DejaBlue. The vulnerabilities could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the
service to the network.

All Siemens Healthineers products from all business lines have been evaluated. Most Siemens Healthi-
neers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate
the Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of
Microsoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows.

This advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommen-
dations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens Healthineers has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers
can apply to reduce the risk:

• Contact Siemens Healthineers Service Technician to obtain information if Remote Desktop Protocol

(RDP) on the product can be disabled to mitigate the risk

• For Siemens Healthineers products that install on customer computers, customers are strongly
recommended to secure those computers as soon as possible with the appropriate patches from
Microsoft

• If possible, block port 3389/tcp on an external ﬁrewall

• Secure the surrounding environment according to the recommendations provided by Microsoft

which can be found here:

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends the following:

• Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.

• For speciﬁc patch and remediation guidance information, contact your local Siemens Healthineers

customer service engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
