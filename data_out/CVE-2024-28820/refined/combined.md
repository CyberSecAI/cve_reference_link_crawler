### @Grissess **[Grissess](/Grissess)** commented [Jun 17, 2024](#issue-2357695043)

An attacker who can control the challenge/response password field could, with a valid LDAP username, pass a string with more than 14 colons into this field, causing a buffer overflow. This happens before the number of tokens is checked for validity below.

This commit ensures that the loop bails before attempting to write past the end of tokenIndexes; as of the currently-published protocol, any response with more than 15 fields is certainly invalid (and will be rejected below).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@samskivert](https://github.com/samskivert) I see that you are previously one of the most active committers to this repository. I just wanted to bring this critical CVE to your attention. I'm guessing that this project is abandoned, and as such it may be pertinent to put a warning banner on the readme file to discourage future use of this project if that is the case. Additionally, the business that is said to provide support per the readme has closed and the security contact email address on the readme was unreachable during the CVE notification process. |
