- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure deserialization of untrusted data. The Telerik Reporting engine deserializes localization assets, and if these assets are replaced with malicious ones, it can lead to code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The vulnerability lies in the unsafe deserialization process of localization assets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local code execution. An attacker can achieve code execution on the system where Telerik Reporting is used by replacing a legitimate localization asset with a malicious one.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the replacement of legitimate Telerik Reporting localization assets with malicious crafted ones.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to replace localization assets used by Telerik Reporting. The attacker must have the ability to introduce custom localization assets into the system.
