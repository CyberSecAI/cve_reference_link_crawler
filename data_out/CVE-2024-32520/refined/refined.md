- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) could potentially perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the specific functionality affected by the missing access control.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a subscriber user through the affected function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a registered subscriber on the WordPress site.
