## Description

This plugin adds repeatable groups of fields to Contact Form 7.

**NOTE:** Tested with Contact Form 7 5.7.7.

### Usage

#### Form tab

Wrap the desired fields with `[field_group your_group_id_here][/field_group]`. The shortcode accepts additional parameters, in WP shortcode format and in CF7 fields parameters format as well.

Example:

```
[field_group emails id="emails-groups" tabindex:1]
    <label>Your Email (required)[email* your-email]</label>
    [radio your-radio use_label_element default:1 "radio 1" "radio 2" "radio 3"]
    [select* your-menu include_blank "option1" "option 2"]
    [checkbox* your-checkbox "check 1" "check 2"]
[/field_group]

```
#### Mail tab

In the mail settings, wrap the fields with your group id. You can use the `[group_index]` tag to print the group index and an additional `__<NUMBER>` to print a field at a specific index.

Example:

```
The second email entered by the user was: [your-email__2]

These were the groups:
[emails]
GROUP #[group_index]
    Checkbox: [your-checkbox]
    E-mail: [your-email]
    Radio: [your-radio]
    Select: [your-menu]
[/emails]

```
