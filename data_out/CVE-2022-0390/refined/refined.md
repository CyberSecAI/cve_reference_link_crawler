{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When an issue link is deleted, the information of the linked issue is returned in the response, even if the user no longer has access to the issue itself.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information disclosure due to lack of access control during issue link deletion."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve information about an issue (title, description, state, assignees, etc.) even after the issue has been made inaccessible to them.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to have previously created a link between a vulnerability report and an issue. After the issue becomes inaccessible to the attacker (e.g., project visibility is changed to private), they can send a DELETE request to remove the issue link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an account on the GitLab instance and must have a vulnerability report. They need to link a public issue to their vulnerability report. The attacker does not need to have access to the linked issue after the fact to exploit the vulnerability."
