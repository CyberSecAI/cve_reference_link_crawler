- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape certain parameters, specifically the `override_search_form` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages within the WordPress site, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By intercepting the request to save the Ajax Search Lite settings and injecting a malicious payload into the `override_search_form` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least administrative privileges (`Admin+` role) on the WordPress site to access the Ajax Search Lite settings panel.
