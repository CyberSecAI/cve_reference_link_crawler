## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ajax Search Lite < 4.12.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Admin+ to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

You need to go to the Ajax Search Lite control panel and save all settings, while intercepting the request. After interception, it is necessary to put the payload in the override\_search\_form=[XSS] parameter
123"test='"><script></script><img+src=x+onerror=alert(777)>
