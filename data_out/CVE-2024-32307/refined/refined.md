- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow in the `fromWizardHandle` function due to insufficient bounds checking on the user-supplied `PPW` parameter within the `decodePwd` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability can allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `/goform/WizardHandle` with specific parameters. The `PPW` parameter is crafted to be larger than the `decode_pwd` buffer in the `decodePwd` function, triggering the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device and be able to craft a malicious payload for the `PPW` parameter.
