- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Custom Actions menu on the request details page. This allowed users with the SDAdmin role to inject malicious JavaScript. The injected script is executed when another user opens a request, accesses the custom menu, and clicks on a button with the "Execute script" action type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A threat actor with SDAdmin role could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with SDAdmin role injects malicious Javascript through the custom action menu in request details page.  The attack is triggered when a user opens a request, accesses the custom menu, and clicks a button.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have SDAdmin role privileges.
