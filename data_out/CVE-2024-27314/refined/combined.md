# Security advisory

## Stored XSS vulnerability in the Custom Actions menu on the request details page

**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-27314

| Product Name | Severity | Affected Version(s) | Fixed Version | Fixed On |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ServiceDesk Plus | Low | 14720 and below | 14730 | May 2, 2024 |
| ServiceDesk Plus MSP | Low | 14710 and below | 14720 | May 22, 2024 |
| SupportCenter Plus | Low | 14710 and below | 14720 | May 22, 2024 |

**Details**

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowed users with the SDAdmin role to inject a malicious JavaScript in the Custom Actions menu on the request details page. The script is executed when a user opens a request, accesses the custom menu, and clicks on the button with the Execute script action type.

We fixed the issue by encoding data during client rendering to prevent the JavaScript from being executed.

**Impact**

The vulnerability can be exploited by threat actors who have SDAdmin role to perform further attacks.
