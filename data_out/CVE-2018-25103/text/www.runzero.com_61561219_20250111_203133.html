## Latest lighttpd vulnerability [#](#latest-lighttpd-vulnerability)

On April 11th, 2024 Binarly [published research](https://www.binarly.io/blog/lighttpd-gains-new-life) showing that Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) derived from the AMI MegaRAC product include older versions of the open source [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) web server. Specifically, their research noted that lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.51 are susceptible to an information leak due to a string comparison against a stale pointer. This issue affects [AMI MegaRAC BMCs](https://www.runzero.com/blog/ami-megarac-bmc/), but also BMCs produced by Intel and Lenovo. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.4.51 and no CVE was assigned. Binarly calculated the CVSS v3.1 scoreas **5.3** *Medium* AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.

runZero provided guidance on detection and mitigation of these issues on the same day, but also started a deeper investigation into the real-world impact of this issue, resulting in the following notes:

* Hundreds of devices from dozens of manufacturers appear to ship the same vulnerable versions of lighttpd. We've included examples of these at the end of this post.

* The lighttpd project did not assign a CVE to this issue, but they did flag it as a security fix in their [change log](https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/blob/master/NEWS).

* The folded header issue highlighted by Binarly may be tricky to exploit. The bug allows for a remote attacker to confirm whether a string referred to by previously-used pointer is equal to a separate string provided by the attacker. In effect, the attacker can only confirm something they can guess, and at worse can use this to do a case-insensitive compare against the reused pointer. An attacker could brute force string values and hope to confirm an address or value in memory, but practically this doesn't seem feasible, as the case-insensitive comparison and the character restrictions (especially in strict header mode) will result in false positive matches and unguessable values.

* The lighttpd project is part of Google's [OSS-Fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/) scope, but the test cases only [cover the "burl" implementation](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/lighttpd) and not the HTTP request parser.

* runZero was able to reproduce this issue using the [AFL++ fuzzing engine](https://aflplus.plus/), but did not identify any additional issues during an overnight fuzzing run.

![AFL++ identifying the header folder use-after-free](/uploads/assets/fuzz-lighttpd.png)

AFL++ identifying the header folding use-after-free bug

* In addition to the information leak with folded headers, lighttpd noted additional security issues in the same range of versions:

```
- 1.4.51 - 2018-10-14
  * [core,security] process headers after combining folded headers
  * [mod_userdir] security: skip username "." and ".."

- 1.4.50 - 2018-08-13
  * [mod_alias] security: potential path traversal with specific configs
  * [core] security: use-after-free invalid Range req
  * [mod_alias] security: path traversal in mod_alias (in some use cases) (fixes #2898)
  * [core] security: use-after-free after invalid Range request (fixes #2899)

```
## What is the impact? [#](#what-is-the-impact)

In the case of the folded header issue, AMI MegaRAC BMCs on servers running lighttpd before version 1.4.51 are susceptible to a limited information leak. This leak does not provide the contents of the stale pointer, but it does allow the attacker to confirm if the reused pointer has a specific string value. As a result, it doesn't appear to be significant, as the attacker can only confirm a value that they are already aware of.

The additional security issues outlined in the [lighttpd changelog](https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/blob/master/NEWS) may be more serious. The mod\_userdir issue can allow a directory traversal attack when the URL `/~../` is requested, but this module may not be commonly enabled. The [mod\_alias issue](https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2898) seems similar in that it could allow traversal from the web root, but is unlikely to apply to most installations as it requires a missing trailing slash in the alias configuration.

This brings us to the [use-after-free fixes](https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2899) for invalid Range requests. It's not clear yet how significant these are yet, but we plan to continue this investigation given how many devices are impacted.

## Are updates or workarounds available? [#](#are-updates-or-workarounds-available)

Although AMI has released updated firmware, Intel and Lenovo have both indicated that their affected products are end-of-life (EOL) and will not receive updates. runZero recommends using network segmentation to prevent access to these outdated lighttpd services from untrusted networks. For BMCs specifically, best practices include isolating these interfaces to a dedicated management network, and leveraging VPNs to provide remote access as needed.

## How do I find potentially vulnerable systems with runZero? [#](#how-do-i-find-potentially-vulnerable-systems-with-runZero)

From the [Services Inventory](https://console.runzero.com/inventory/services), use the following query to locate systems running potentially vulnerable software:

```
product:lighttpd (_service.product:=lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.0% OR _service.product:=lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.1% OR _service.product:=lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.2% OR _service.product:=lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.3% OR _service.product:=lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.4% OR _service.product:=lighttpd:1.4.50)
```
## Known devices with outdated lighttpd installations [#](#known-devices-with-outdated-lighttpd-installations)
