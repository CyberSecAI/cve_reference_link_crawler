**Two security vulnerabilities in H2 Console ([CVE-2022-23221](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45hx-wfhj-473x "CVE-2022-23221") and possible DNS rebinding attack) are fixed.**

Persistent databases created by H2 2.0.x don't need to be upgraded.

Persistent databases created by H2 1.4.200 and older versions require export into SQL script with that old version and creation of a new database with the new version and execution of this script in it.
