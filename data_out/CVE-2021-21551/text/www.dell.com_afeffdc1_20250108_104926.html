Manually remove the vulnerable *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* driver from the system using the following steps:

1. Check the following locations for the *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* driver file:

* C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp
* C:\Windows\Temp

2. Select the *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* file and hold down the SHIFT key while pressing the DELETE key to permanently delete.

3. From an administrator command prompt, run “sc.exe delete DBUtil\_2\_3”.

Reference: For information on sc.exe commands, see [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-delete).

**2.3 Obtain an updated, remediated version of the driver**
Execute the following to obtain an updated driver (*DBUtilDrv2.sys*) on your system.

Reminder: The updated driver was previously installed for certain products and components as a part of the instructions in Section 2.2.1.

For a Dell Client platform which has an impacted firmware update utility package:

* With your next scheduled firmware update, download and apply the latest available firmware update utility which contains a remediated dbutil driver (*DBUtilDrv2.sys*). Customers can use one of the [Dell Download Notification solutions](https://www.dell.com/support/contents/en-us/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/download-center/drivers-and-downloads/notifications) to receive updated firmware update utility packages, as applicable.
* Reboot your system

**Notes:**

* For supported platforms running Windows 10, updates are available as of the publishing of this advisory. (See Table A)
* For supported platforms running Windows 7 or 8.1, updates are now available.

If you update your BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or doc firmware prior to the updates being available, you must also execute one of the three options defined in Step 2.2.2 of this section – even if you have previously performed this step – immediately following the update.

**3. What to know when installing a firmware update using an unremediated firmware update utility package**
You should still execute the steps in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 now. However, if you later update your BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or dock firmware, to a version prior to the versions listed in Table A, you must take the following actions after applying the firmware update:

1. Reboot your system.
2. Repeat step 2.2.2 to again remove the *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* driver from your system.

**4. What to know when using end of service life (aka end of support) platforms, products, or components**
Remediated packages will not be provided for end of service life platforms (see Table B). Therefore, you must:

1. Execute the steps in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
2. After applying any firmware update, including BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or dock firmware:

Reference: For information on sc.exe commands, see [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-delete).

**2.3 Obtain an updated, remediated version of the driver**
Execute the following to obtain an updated driver (*DBUtilDrv2.sys*) on your system.

Reminder: The updated driver was previously installed for certain products and components as a part of the instructions in Section 2.2.1.

For a Dell Client platform which has an impacted firmware update utility package:

* With your next scheduled firmware update, download and apply the latest available firmware update utility which contains a remediated dbutil driver (*DBUtilDrv2.sys*). Customers can use one of the [Dell Download Notification solutions](https://www.dell.com/support/contents/en-us/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/download-center/drivers-and-downloads/notifications) to receive updated firmware update utility packages, as applicable.
* Reboot your system

**Notes:**

* For supported platforms running Windows 10, updates are available as of the publishing of this advisory. (See Table A)
* For supported platforms running Windows 7 or 8.1, updates are now available. Please refer to Table A of [DSA-2021-152](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000190105/dsa-2021-152-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-an-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability-in-the-dell-dbutildrv2-sys-driver), for the minimum BIOS version that contains the updated driver. If you update your BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or doc firmware prior to the updates being available, you must also execute one of the three options defined in Step 2.2.2 of this section – even if you have previously performed this step – immediately following the update.

**3. What to know when installing a firmware update using an unremediated firmware update utility package**
You should still execute the steps in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 now. However, if you later update your BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or dock firmware, to a version prior to the versions listed in Table A, you must take the following actions after applying the firmware update:

1. Reboot your system.
2. Repeat step 2.2.2 to again remove the *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* driver from your system.

**4. What to know when using end of service life (aka end of support) platforms, products, or components**
Remediated packages will not be provided for end of service life platforms (see Table B). Therefore, you must:

1. Execute the steps in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
2. After applying any firmware update, including BIOS, Thunderbolt firmware, TPM firmware, or dock firmware:

* Reboot your system.
* Repeat step 2.2.2 to again remove the *dbutil\_2\_3.sys* driver from your system.
