Welcome to the School Task Manager, a web application designed to help you efficiently manage and keep track of your school tasks and subjects. This application has been developed using PHP and leverages the power of a relational database to store and organize your academic responsibilities.

Just as with [**My Food Recipe**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16816/my-food-recipe-using-php-source-code.html) and [**Expense Tracker App**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16794/simple-expense-tracker-app-using-php-source-code.html), which also employ the principles of [**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16768/php-crud-using-pdo-connection-free-source-code.html) and the concept of [**joining tables**](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16775/php-crud-joins-two-tables-free-source-code.html), our School Task Manager harnesses these very techniques to provide you with a user-friendly and efficient platform.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Management:** With the School Task Manager, you can easily create, update, and delete tasks. You can assign tasks to specific subjects, set deadlines, and monitor the status of each task.
2. **Subject Management:** Organize your academic subjects with ease. You can add new subjects, edit existing ones, and delete subjects when needed.
3. **Task Status:** Keep track of your tasks by categorizing them into three statuses: "Pending," "In Progress," and "Completed." This feature helps you prioritize and focus on what needs to be done.

**How to Use:**

* **Home Tab:** The home tab displays all your tasks across different subjects and their respective statuses. You can quickly add new tasks from here.
* **Pending Tasks Tab:** This tab shows tasks that are pending or yet to be started. It helps you focus on what's due soon.
* **In Progress Tasks Tab:** Tasks that are currently in progress are displayed here. You can update their status as they move towards completion.
* **Completed Tasks Tab:** View tasks you've successfully completed in this tab.
* **Subjects Tab:** Manage your subjects by adding, editing, or deleting them.
