Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-50034.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing initialization of `icsk->icsk_sync_mss` for IPPROTO_SMC sockets. When `INET_PROTOSW_ICSK` is set, `icsk->icsk_sync_mss` must also be set to a valid function pointer. This function is called during the socket creation to synchronize the Maximum Segment Size (MSS). The lack of initialization resulted in a NULL pointer dereference during socket creation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference when the kernel attempts to call `icsk->icsk_sync_mss` which was not initialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** The vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS). The system crashes and becomes unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Socket Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of an IPPROTO_SMC socket.
- An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by creating a socket using IPPROTO_SMC and triggering a code path which calls the uninitialized `icsk->icsk_sync_mss`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create sockets, which typically requires local access or the ability to trigger socket creation via a network service or application.

**Additional Details:**
- The patch introduces a toy implementation of `smc_sync_mss` to prevent the panic. This function simply returns 0, indicating that MSS synchronization for IPPROTO_SMC isn't fully supported yet.
- The patch notes that MSS can be set via `sock_create_kern` or `smc_setsockopt`, however synchronization within `__sys_connect_file` is missing and this patch provides a foundation for this in the future.
