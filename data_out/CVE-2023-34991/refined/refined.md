- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute unauthorized SQL queries via a crafted HTTP request. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or other malicious actions depending on the database privileges and the specific SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted HTTP request
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FortiWLM instance and does not require prior authentication.
