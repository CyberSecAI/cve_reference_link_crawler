- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing function level access control, allowing a regular GUI user to edit the avatar picture of other users, including those with higher privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A regular user can modify the avatar picture of other users, which could lead to impersonation or social engineering attacks, although the impact is considered low. The arbitrary picture upload could also be leveraged to upload malicious content that could potentially be used in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a regular user account on the vulnerable FortiAnalyzer or FortiManager system.
