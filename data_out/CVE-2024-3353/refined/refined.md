Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `categ` parameter of the `admin/mod_reports/index.php` file. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The `categ` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. This vulnerability is present in the `admin/mod_reports/index.php` file.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Data Access: An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass security measures and access sensitive data, such as customer information, personal data, and other confidential information.
- Data Modification/Deletion: The attacker can also modify or delete data within the database.
- Full Database Control: In some cases, an attacker can gain full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack is performed through an HTTP POST request to the `admin/mod_reports/index.php` file.
- Malicious `categ` Parameter: The `categ` parameter is injected with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- Application Knowledge: Some knowledge of the application structure is useful but not essential as tools like sqlmap can automate the process.
- Authentication (potentially): Although not stated, the vulnerable page is within the admin panel, so the attacker likely needs to be logged into the admin panel.

**Detailed Exploitation Information (from GitHub Content):**

- The provided GitHub content includes a proof-of-concept using the `sqlmap` tool.
- It shows how different types of SQL injection (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query) can be exploited.
- The provided sqlmap output demonstrates the injection payloads that can be used.
- The request targets the `categ` parameter in the POST data with manipulated SQL injection payloads.
