# Account Takeover

Critical

[daftspunk](/daftspunk)
published
GHSA-mxr5-mc97-63rc
Aug 26, 2021

## Package

composer

october/system
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.0.471, 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.0.472, 1.1.5

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can request an account password reset and then gain access to the account using a specially crafted request.

* To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must know the username of an administrator and have access to the password reset form.

### Patches

* Issue has been patched in Build 472 and v1.1.5
* [Shortened patch instructions](https://github.com/daftspunk/CVE-2021-32648)

### Workarounds

Apply [octobercms/library@016a297](https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/016a297b1bec55d2e53bc889458ed2cb5c3e9374) and [octobercms/library@5bd1a28](https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/5bd1a28140b825baebe6becd4f7562299d3de3b9) to your installation manually if you are unable to upgrade.

[**Update 2022-01-20**] [Shortened patch instructions](https://github.com/daftspunk/CVE-2021-32648) can be found here.

### Recommendations

We recommend the following steps to make sure your server stays secure:

* Keep server OS and system software up to date.
* Keep October CMS software up to date.
* Use a multi-factor authentication plugin.
* Change the [default backend URL](https://github.com/octobercms/october/blob/1.1/config/cms.php#L39) or block public access to the backend area.
* Include the [Roave/SecurityAdvisories](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories) Composer package to ensure that your application doesn't have installed dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
