Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32648

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how permissions were checked in the October CMS authentication system. Specifically, the system was not correctly handling cases where permission values were strings instead of integers. This allowed for a bypass of permission checks under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type confusion**: The system was not strictly enforcing integer type for permission values, leading to issues when comparing string values in permission checks. This can lead to an unexpected bypass of access controls.
- **Inconsistent comparison**: The system used loose comparison (`==`) instead of strict comparison (`===`) in several places when comparing values. This also contributed to bypassing intended logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to an administrator account by exploiting the vulnerability in the password reset mechanism. The crafted request bypasses authentication, leading to complete control of the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Password reset form**: The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker requests a password reset. By crafting a specific request, they can bypass the standard security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Known username**: The attacker must know the username of an administrator account.
- **Access to password reset form**: The attacker must have access to the password reset form of the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `october/system` versions 1.0.471 and 1.1.1.
- The issue was patched in versions 1.0.472 and 1.1.5
- The fix involved type casting to integer and using strict comparison in the permission checking logic, specifically using `(int) $value === 1` instead of `$value == 1` and `$value === 1`.

**Relevant Code Changes:**
The provided diffs show the following changes were made to address the vulnerability:
- `src/Auth/Models/Role.php`:
    - Changed `$value == 1` to `$value === 1`
    - Added `(int) $value` type casting where `$value` is used in a comparison.
- `src/Auth/Models/User.php`:
    - Changed `$value == 1` to `$value === 1`
    - Added `(int) $value` type casting where `$value` is used in a comparison.
- `src/Auth/Manager.php`:
  - Changed `$credential == 'password'` to `$credential === 'password'`
- `src/Auth/Models/Throttle.php`:
  - Changed `$this->getLoginAttempts() == 0` to `$this->getLoginAttempts() === 0`
- Other strict comparison changes were made for `checkPersistCode`, `checkResetPasswordCode`, `inGroup`, to ensure proper value checks.

This vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass intended permission checks and potentially gain access to admin accounts by requesting a password reset with a specially crafted request.
