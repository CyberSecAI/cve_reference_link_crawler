### Impact

* [Shortened patch instructions](https://github.com/daftspunk/CVE-2021-32648)

### Recommendations

We recommend the following steps to make sure your server stays secure:

* Keep server OS and system software up to date.
* Keep October CMS software up to date.
* Use a multi-factor authentication plugin.
* Change the [default backend URL](https://github.com/octobercms/october/blob/1.1/config/cms.php#L39) or block public access to the backend area.
* Include the [Roave/SecurityAdvisories](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories) Composer package to ensure that your application doesn't have installed dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
