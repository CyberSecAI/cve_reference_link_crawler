- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free vulnerability triggered while parsing specially crafted DWG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted DWG file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious DWG file with the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required. The attacker does not need to be on the local machine.
