SSA-932528: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads specially crafted ﬁles in various formats such as DWG, IFC, OBJ or STP format. If
a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the
vulnerability to crash the application or execute arbitrary code.

Siemens has released several updates for Solid Edge SE2023 and recommends to update to the latest
version.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes: 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0973

STEPTools v18SP1 ifcmesh library (v18.1) is affected due to a null pointer dereference, which could
allow an attacker to deny application usage when reading a specially constructed ﬁle, resulting in an
application crash. (ZDI-CAN-19429)
