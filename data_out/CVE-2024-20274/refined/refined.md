**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access: Requires valid credentials for a user account with policy-editing permissions (e.g., Network Admin, Intrusion Admin, or custom roles with equivalent capabilities).
- Remote access: The attacker must be able to access the web-based management interface of the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center remotely.
