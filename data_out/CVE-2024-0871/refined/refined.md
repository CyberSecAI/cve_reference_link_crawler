### CVE-2024-0871
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-0871:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when rendering URLs.
- Improper handling of user-controlled input in the Icon Widget, specifically the `fl_builder_data[node_preview][link]` and `fl_builder_data[settings][link_target]` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied URLs, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Reflected (DOM-Based) XSS:** A similar XSS issue exists in the rendering of URLs, which can lead to DOM-based XSS.
- Shortcode rendering: Issues related to shortcodes that could potentially render protected content to unauthorized users.
- HTML escaping: Inadequate escaping of HTML when rendering saved layouts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into website pages.
- **User Impersonation:** Successful XSS can allow attackers to steal session cookies and take over user accounts.
- **Data theft or manipulation:** XSS vulnerabilities can be used to steal user data or manipulate the content of the website.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with contributor-level access can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page

**Attack vectors:**
- **Icon Widget:** The primary attack vector is through the Icon Widget, where malicious code can be inserted into the 'link' and 'link_target' parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated access:** Attackers require at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website.
- **Ability to use the Beaver Builder plugin:** Attackers need to be able to create or modify content using the Beaver Builder plugin.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content provides more details than the placeholder CVE description, including specific vulnerable parameters and more details on the type of XSS.
- The fix involved additional sanitization and escaping when rendering URLs, fixing the reflected XSS issue, fixing shortcode issues, and escaping HTML in the UI for saved layouts.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of Beaver Builder up to and including 2.7.4.2.
- The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.7.4.3.
