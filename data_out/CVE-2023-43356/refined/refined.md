Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Global Metadata" field located in the "Settings - Global Settings Menu" of CMSmadesimple v2.2.18.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize or encode the user-provided data before storing and rendering it. This allows a malicious script to be injected and persistently stored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Global Metadata field. This code will be executed in the context of other users who access pages where this global metadata is displayed, such as the main website.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Settings - Global Settings Menu" in the CMS admin panel.
- An attacker with the ability to access this section can input the malicious script into the Global Metadata field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the necessary privileges to access and modify the "Global Settings" section of the CMSmadesimple admin panel. This suggests a local, authenticated attacker with administrator privileges or similar permissions.
