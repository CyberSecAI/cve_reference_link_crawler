Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-5770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** in the `ajax_save_setting` function of the WP Force SSL & HTTPS SSL Redirect WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for updating the plugin's settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of a proper capability check before allowing users to modify plugin settings. The code failed to verify if the user had the necessary "manage_options" capability, which is required to manage plugin settings.
*   **Insecure AJAX Endpoint:** The `ajax_save_setting` function was accessible via an AJAX endpoint without proper restriction to authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or higher could exploit this vulnerability to modify the plugin's settings. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Disabling SSL enforcement.
    *   Changing other security-related settings.
    *   Manipulating the behavior of the plugin.
    *   Complete compromise of website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network by sending a crafted AJAX request.
*   **Authentication:** Attackers must have an account on the WordPress site to exploit this. Even subscriber-level accounts have the capability to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **AJAX Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable `ajax_save_setting` endpoint, modifying the plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site's admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the WP Force SSL & HTTPS SSL Redirect plugin up to and including 1.66.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.67 by adding a proper capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) before allowing access to modify the plugin settings.
*   The provided information from the Trac changeset confirms that the fix involved changing the capability check from `administrator` to `manage_options` in multiple places in the plugin code, including the vulnerable function.

This vulnerability allows low privileged users to modify critical security settings of the plugin, making it a significant issue.
