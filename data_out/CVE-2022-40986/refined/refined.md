The content is related to CVE-2022-40986.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper size checks on the input parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function is used to format a string and store it in a fixed-size buffer on the stack. User-controlled input parameters are included in the formatted string, and their sizes are not validated. This allows for an attacker to provide a large parameter, exceeding the bufferâ€™s capacity, causing the overflow.
- Lack of input validation: The `DetranCLI` does not properly validate the size of input parameters before using them in `sprintf` calls.
- Vulnerable code pattern: The code uses a pattern where input parameters are directly incorporated into a format string for `sprintf` without any checks, making it susceptible to buffer overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the device by exploiting this vulnerability. The attacker could overwrite return addresses on the stack, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted network packet sent to the device. The attacker needs to send a command to the `DetranCLI` interface that triggers the vulnerable `sprintf` call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the DetranCLI interface (requires authentication).
- According to CVSS score, attacker needs to have high privileges.

**Details for CVE-2022-40986:**

- **Vulnerable Command Template:** `(ddns1|ddns2) mx WORD`
- **Vulnerable Code:** `sprintf(buff_0x200,"%s<%s:%s<%s<%s<%s<%s<%s","","","","","0",argv[1],"0","");`
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `mx` command is used within the `ddns1` or `ddns2` context.
- The `WORD` parameter, represented by `argv[1]` in the code, is directly inserted into the `sprintf` call.
- The `buff_0x200` buffer has a size of 0x200 bytes.
- An attacker can provide a string larger than the available space and cause a buffer overflow.
