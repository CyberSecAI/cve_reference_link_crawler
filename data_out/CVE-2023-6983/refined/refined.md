Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6983

**Description:** The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the "Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.2.1.

**Root Cause:**
The plugin's `vg_display_data` shortcode lacks proper validation of user-supplied keys. This allows authenticated users to access and retrieve post meta data they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin uses a user-supplied key to directly access post meta, without verifying if the user has the authorization to access that specific key.
*   **Missing Input Validation:**  The shortcode does not validate or sanitize the `key` parameter before using it to fetch data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher can use the `vg_display_data` shortcode to retrieve any post meta data, including potentially sensitive information that they are not authorized to view. This could lead to the exposure of internal data, private information, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (Contributor-level or higher) with the ability to create or edit posts/pages.
*   The attacker would craft a shortcode using the `vg_display_data` shortcode and specify the `key` parameter to retrieve post meta data associated with a post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create or edit content where they can inject shortcodes.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.0 of the plugin. The patch introduces a settings page where administrators can whitelist the field keys allowed to be accessed via the shortcode, mitigating the IDOR vulnerability.
* The "sanitization" and "wp_filter" parameters have been removed and replaced with `wpautop` and `do_shortcodes` parameters, all output is sanitized with `wp_kses_post` now
* The `callable` parameter has been removed
