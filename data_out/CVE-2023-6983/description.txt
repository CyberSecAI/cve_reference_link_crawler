The Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 via the vg_display_data shortcode due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to retrieve potentially sensitive post meta.
