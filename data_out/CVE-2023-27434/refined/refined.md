- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, which can be exploited by a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, will trigger unwanted actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a higher-privileged user into executing a crafted request, which is usually done through social engineering. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
