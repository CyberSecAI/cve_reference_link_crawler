- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the Social module of M-Files Hubshare, specifically when non-admin users are allowed to create chats.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored HTML Injection, which allows an attacker to embed malicious HTML code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can spoof UI elements, potentially tricking a victim into entering credentials on a fake login dialog. This requires user interaction to be effective, it is not automatic. Although categorized under CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), the vulnerability doesn't actually allow scripts to run (no XSS).
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user crafts a chat message containing malicious HTML and submits it to a chat group.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create chats within the Hubshare Social module. The victim user needs to view this malicious content.
