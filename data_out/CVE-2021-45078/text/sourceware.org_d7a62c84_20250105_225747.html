| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=28694#c0)  Pavel Mayorov    2021-12-14 14:02:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13851](attachment.cgi?id=13851 "PoC and ASAN report") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=13851&action=edit "PoC and ASAN report") PoC and ASAN report  I found an out-of-bounds write to the array 'info->xcoff_types' in the function 'stab_xcoff_builtin_type' (binutils/stabs.c).  Processing of typenum -34 results in overwriting of adjacent field 'info->tags' at line 3668:   info->xcoff_types[-typenum] = rettype;  This eventually leads to a segmentation fault due to illegal memory reference performed by the function 'finish_stab'. ASAN catches this as heap-buffer-overflow.  Steps to reproduce:  Build current verison of binutils with ASAN: ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-gdbserver CFLAGS="-ggdb -Wno-error -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb -Wno-error -fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address" make all  Run inputs under ASAN: binutils/objdump -g ~/oob_write  The proof-of-concept and ASAN report are attached. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=28694#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2021-12-15 01:30:27 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Alan Modra <amodra@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=161e87d12167b1e36193385485c1f6ce92f74f02>  commit 161e87d12167b1e36193385485c1f6ce92f74f02 Author: Alan Modra <amodra@gmail.com> Date:   Wed Dec 15 11:48:42 2021 +1030      [PR28694](show_bug.cgi?id=28694 "RESOLVED FIXED - stabs.c: Out-of-bounds write in stab_xcoff_builtin_type"), Out-of-bounds write in stab_xcoff_builtin_type                  [PR 28694](show_bug.cgi?id=28694 "RESOLVED FIXED - stabs.c: Out-of-bounds write in stab_xcoff_builtin_type")             * stabs.c (stab_xcoff_builtin_type): Make typenum unsigned.             Negate typenum earlier, simplifying bounds checking.  Correct             off-by-one indexing.  Adjust switch cases. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=28694#c2)  Alan Modra    2021-12-15 01:31:02 UTC  ``` Fixed. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=28694#c3)  Pavel Mayorov    2021-12-16 07:47:04 UTC  ``` CVE-2021-45078 ``` |  |
