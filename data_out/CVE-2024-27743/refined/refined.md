- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `Address` field of the `add_invoices.php` component before storing it in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browsers of other users when they view the `manage_invoices.php` page. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1. Access the login page of the application (`http://localhost/fuelflow/index.php`).
    2. Log in with the default credentials `mayuri.infospace@gmail.com` / `admin`.
    3. Navigate to `http://localhost/fuelflow/admin/add_invoices.php`.
    4. Input the payload `<script>alert(0)</script>` into the `Address` field.
    5. The XSS will be triggered when visiting the `http://localhost/fuelflow/admin/manage_invoices.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the application's login page and must be able to log in, which is made easier because the default credentials are known. They then need to be able to navigate to `add_invoices.php` to input the malicious payload.
