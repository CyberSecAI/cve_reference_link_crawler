The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities fixed in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2024-36162:

**CVE-2024-36162:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to inject malicious script.
    *   Requires user interaction (UI:R) by a victim to trigger the injected script.

**Explanation and details:**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server (AEM) and executed when a victim accesses the affected page. The attacker needs to have low privileges to inject the malicious script. After injecting the script, if a user views the page, the script will run in their browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal their session cookies, or redirect to malicious websites. The CVSS vector indicates that the scope is changed (S:C), meaning the impact can extend beyond the vulnerable component.  The confidentiality, integrity and availability impact are low.

**Affected versions:**

*   Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Cloud Service (CS)
*   AEM 6.5.20 and earlier versions

**Solution:**
Upgrade to:
* AEM Cloud Service Release 2024.5
* AEM 6.5.21
