Subject: Fwd: [Security-announce][CVE-2024-5642] Buffer over-read in
 SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() for Python 3.9 and earlier

Note that in versions of Python that still had NPN support, whether NPN support
is built depends on which SSL library/version you build with:

There is a buffer over-read defect in CPython 3.9 and earlier due to not
excluding an invalid value for OpenSSL's NPN APIs.

This vulnerability is of severity *LOW*.

CPython doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]") for
SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() which is an invalid value for the underlying
OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see
CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN
being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon
in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).

Suggested mitigation is one of the following:

* Upgrade to Python 3.10 or later where NPN isn't supported
* Avoid using NPN via SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()
* Avoid providing an empty list as a parameter to SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()
