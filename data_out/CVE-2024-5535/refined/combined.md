Ensure that the provided client list is non-NULL and starts with a valid
entry. When called from the ALPN callback the client list should already
have been validated by OpenSSL so this should not cause a problem. When
called from the NPN callback the client list is locally configured and
will not have already been validated. Therefore SSL_select_next_proto
should not assume that it is correctly formatted.

We implement stricter checking of the client protocol list. We also do the
same for the server list while we are about it.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [27th June 2024]
==========================================
SSL\_select\_next\_proto buffer overread (CVE-2024-5535)
=====================================================
Severity: Low
Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.
Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.
The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).
This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a "no overlap"
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.
In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.
This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.
The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.2 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.3 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.7 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.15 once it is released.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1za once it is released
(premium support customers only).
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zk once it is released
(premium support customers only).
Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available. The fix is also available in commit e86ac436f0 (for 3.3),
commit 99fb785a5f (for 3.2), commit 4ada436a19 (for 3.1) and commit cf6f91f612
(for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git repository. It is available to premium support
customers in commit b78ec0824d (for 1.1.1) and commit 99472514130 for (1.0.2).
This issue was reported on 2nd May 2024 by Joseph Birr-Pixton. Additional
analysis was provided by David Benjamin (Google). The fix was developed by
Matt Caswell.

```
Ensure that the provided client list is non-NULL and starts with a valid
entry. When called from the ALPN callback the client list should already
have been validated by OpenSSL so this should not cause a problem. When
called from the NPN callback the client list is locally configured and
will not have already been validated. Therefore SSL_select_next_proto
should not assume that it is correctly formatted.

We implement stricter checking of the client protocol list. We also do the
same for the server list while we are about it.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [27th June 2024]
==========================================

SSL_select_next_proto buffer overread (CVE-2024-5535)
=====================================================

Severity: Low

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a "no overlap"
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.2 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.3 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.7 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.15 once it is released.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1za once it is released
(premium support customers only).

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zk once it is released
(premium support customers only).

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available. The fix is also available in commit e86ac436f0 (for 3.3),
commit 99fb785a5f (for 3.2), commit 4ada436a19 (for 3.1) and commit cf6f91f612
(for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git repository. It is available to premium support
customers in commit b78ec0824d (for 1.1.1) and commit 99472514130 for (1.0.2).

This issue was reported on 2nd May 2024 by Joseph Birr-Pixton. Additional
analysis was provided by David Benjamin (Google). The fix was developed by
Matt Caswell.

Subject: Fwd: [Security-announce][CVE-2024-5642] Buffer over-read in
 SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() for Python 3.9 and earlier

Note that in versions of Python that still had NPN support, whether NPN support
is built depends on which SSL library/version you build with:

SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() for Python 3.9 and earlier
Date: 	Thu, 27 Jun 2024 16:09:13 -0500
From: 	Seth Larson <seth@...hon.org>
Reply-To: 	security-sig@...hon.org
To: 	security-announce@...hon.org

There is a buffer over-read defect in CPython 3.9 and earlier due to not
excluding an invalid value for OpenSSL's NPN APIs.

This vulnerability is of severity *LOW*.

CPython doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]") for
SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() which is an invalid value for the underlying
OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see
CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN
being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon
in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).

Suggested mitigation is one of the following:

* Upgrade to Python 3.10 or later where NPN isn't supported
* Avoid using NPN via SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()
* Avoid providing an empty list as a parameter to SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()

Subject: Re: feedback requested regarding deprecation of TLS
 1.0/1.1

Hello,

I have no particular insight on the prevalence of TLS 1.0/1.1 these
days, but I want to make a more general comment.
My impression of OpenSSL is that it has a strong tendency to ship
"bloat", i.e., features that either barely anyone needs, but that still
get added (remember Heartbeat extension?), or that should've been
deprecated long ago.

If this effort to deprecate old protocols is a sign that this is
changing, I welcome this. I'd recommend to have a look at other things
in the OpenSSL codebase that should be trimmed.

A few examples:

* OpenSSL recently had a vuln in the NPN code (CVE-2024-5535). NPN
  was a mechanism introduced to select an underlying protocol in order
  to introduce SPDY (later HTTP/2) as an alternative to HTTP/1.1. NPN
  was replaced by a different mechanism called ALPN. This happened a
  decade ago (ALPN RFC is from 2014), which leads to the question: Why
  does OpenSSL still support NPN? It allears like something that can
  be removed with little or no compatibility risk.

* OpenSSL contains code for SCSV, which was an anti-downgrade
  protection in times where browsers still did out-of-protocol insecure
  downgrade. I think it was introduced after the POODLE attack.
  Browsers have long deprecated out-of-protocol downgrades, downgrade
  protection in TLS 1.3 works entirely different, and with the
  deprecation of TLS 1.0/1.1, SCSV appears pointless. Again, I don't
  thinkt here's any big compatibility risk in removal.

* OpenSSL contains code for the TLS padding extension, I believe it's
  even enabled by default. This was introduced due to defect F5 devices
  that had trouble with TLS handshakes in a certain size range (if my
  memory is correct, it didn't like anything between 256 and 512
  bytes). This was 2013. I hope noone is running such load balancers
  without firmware updates any more (I somehow doubt they even speak to
  modern TLS stacks). Again: Candidate for safe removal?

I also think OpenSSL could be more adverse to implementing new
features. While 3.3 mainly seems to add QUIC support (I know there's
some controversy *how* OpenSSL does this, but I'm not deep enough into
it to comment on it), but I remember that the 3.2 release appeared to
me as adding a whole bunch of algorithms that I find at least partly
questionable.
<https://openssl-library.org/news/openssl-3.2-notes/index.html>
While things like deterministic ECDSA, or Argo2, appear somewhat legit,
adding ciphers that are essentially "not invented here syndrome", like
Brainpool curves, or SM4, should be avoided.
I also think there's probably potential to remove some obsolete
ciphers (DSA?).

Ensure that the provided client list is non-NULL and starts with a valid
entry. When called from the ALPN callback the client list should already
have been validated by OpenSSL so this should not cause a problem. When
called from the NPN callback the client list is locally configured and
will not have already been validated. Therefore SSL_select_next_proto
should not assume that it is correctly formatted.

We implement stricter checking of the client protocol list. We also do the
same for the server list while we are about it.
