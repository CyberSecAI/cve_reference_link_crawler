Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-5547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a missing length check for the object identifier (OID) read from the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) input within the Libraries component of OpenJDK. Specifically, the code does not validate the length of the object identifier before allocating memory to store it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, specifically the length of the ObjectIdentifier in the DER input.
*   **Memory Allocation Issue:** The missing length check leads to the allocation of memory based on an unchecked value, making it vulnerable to excessive memory usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the Java application to consume excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The application might become unresponsive or crash due to excessive memory usage if a large, specially crafted DER input is provided.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DER Input:** An attacker can craft a malicious DER input containing an OID that specifies a large length value to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Application Processing DER:** The attack relies on the targeted application processing this malicious DER input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply DER Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted DER input to a Java application that uses the affected component. This might be achieved in various ways, such as embedding it within a data stream processed by the application.
*   **No special privileges are required**.
