The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's NFS server (nfsd) within the `nfsd_rename()` function.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An error bail-out path was added in a previous commit (`a8b0026847b8`) to handle cases where parent directories in a rename operation do not have a common ancestor, which could lead to a deadlock. However, this error path failed to release the remount protection acquired during the rename operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a resource leak: the remount protection is not released when the rename operation fails, potentially leading to system instability or other issues if this occurs repeatedly. This could be considered a denial of service, as a single rename operation may not cause an issue, but multiple repeated failures can cause a system to stall.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Failure to release remount protection could lead to resource exhaustion or a deadlock, preventing further rename operations. A series of failed renames could potentially lead to denial of service of the NFS server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the error path in `nfsd_rename()`, specifically the condition where the parent directories of a rename operation do not share a common ancestor, causing the function to enter the faulty error bail-out. This error path was introduced in commit `a8b0026847b8`. The attacker would have to cause the rename to trigger this particular error condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger rename operations on an NFS share served by the vulnerable kernel, where the rename operation will cause the source and destination directories to not have a common ancestor.
- The attacker likely needs access to the NFS service, and will have to craft an operation that triggers the specific error condition.
- No specific position or special privileges beyond normal NFS client usage are mentioned

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix ensures that `fh_drop_write(ffhp)` is called in the error cleanup path (`out_want_write`), which correctly releases the acquired remount protection.
- The fix is also backported to older stable kernel versions.
