      "CVE": "CVE-2023-49539",
      "source": "github.com_10611d15_20250110_210323.html",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the 'Category Name' field, before displaying it in the web page.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
         "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the user's browser. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or content modification.",
      "attack_vectors": "A crafted payload is injected into the 'Category Name' field during category creation/edition.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the application's category management feature. They must be able to create or edit a category and input the malicious script in the 'Category Name' field.",
        "additional_information": "The specific vulnerable page is '/bsms_ci/index.php/category/'. The provided payload is '<\\td><script>alert(document.domain)</script>'."

      "CVE": "CVE-2023-49539",
      "source": "owasp.org_3377b5af_20250110_210324.html",
       "root_cause": "XSS attacks occur when data enters a web application through an untrusted source and is included in dynamic content sent to a web user without proper validation or encoding. Injected scripts can access cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and even modify the HTML content.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Lack of Output Encoding"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can transmit private data, redirect victims to malicious sites, or perform malicious operations on the user's machine, potentially leading to complete account compromise. XSS can also be used to modify content or cause other problems ranging from annoyance to serious security breaches.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications via untrusted sources. This can occur via reflected, stored, or DOM-based methods.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need to be able to inject malicious scripts via user inputs into the web application. In reflected XSS, they may need to trick users into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form. In stored XSS, the attacker's script is permanently stored on the server.",
        "additional_information": "This document provides a general description of XSS vulnerabilities and prevention techniques, but does not provide information specific to CVE-2023-49539 other than describing general XSS attacks."

      "source": "owasp.org_b9e27663_20250110_210324.html",
       "root_cause": "Injection vulnerabilities arise when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application, and dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls are used directly in the interpreter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Injection Flaws",
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Lack of Context-Aware Escaping"
      ],
       "impact": "Attackers can use injection flaws to execute arbitrary SQL commands or OS commands, extract sensitive information, modify or delete data, or invoke stored procedures. Injection attacks can lead to complete system compromise or data breaches.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers inject hostile data into various input fields such as parameters, headers, URLs, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data. This data is used to construct SQL or OS commands, which are then executed by the application.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need to be able to submit user-supplied data through application interfaces. This data is then used to construct dynamic queries or commands that are vulnerable to injection.",
        "additional_information": "This document is a general description of injection vulnerabilities as defined in the OWASP Top 10, but it doesn't provide specific details about the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-49539."
