Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL check on the `function` pointer in the `pcs_set_mux()` function within the `drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-single.c` file.
- The `pinmux_generic_get_function()` function can return NULL, and the code was directly dereferencing the `function` pointer without checking if it was NULL first.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a potential NULL pointer dereference. If `pinmux_generic_get_function()` returns NULL, the subsequent access to `function->data` would lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a **kernel crash** (Denial of Service). An attacker triggering this condition would cause the system to become unresponsive, as the kernel would attempt to dereference a null pointer, resulting in a system halt.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering a call to `pcs_set_mux()` where `pinmux_generic_get_function()` returns NULL. This is related to pin control functionality which is highly dependent on the hardware and driver configuration and potentially exposed through device configuration interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to control the configuration of the pin control system in such a way that would cause `pinmux_generic_get_function()` to return NULL during the call to `pcs_set_mux()`.
- It would require some knowledge of the target system's pin control configuration and the ability to interact with it.

**Additional details:**
- The fix adds a check `if (!function)` before accessing `function->data`, returning `-EINVAL` if `function` is NULL and preventing the crash.
- The vulnerability was found by the Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) using SVACE static analysis tool.
- The fix is present in multiple commits with the same upstream commit id, across various stable kernel versions.

In summary, this vulnerability was a straightforward NULL pointer dereference that could lead to a system crash, and it was fixed by adding a simple NULL check before dereferencing the pointer.
