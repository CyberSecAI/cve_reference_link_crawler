Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or HTML entity encoding in the add/edit form fields of certain web pages within ACI Worldwide Proactive Risk Manager v 9.1.1.0. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript/HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.
- Input validation and sanitization are not properly implemented

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use social engineering to trick users into clicking on malicious URLs.
-  Alternatively, an attacker can wait for a victim to access the page containing the stored XSS.
-  Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Malware installation on the user's machine
    - Cookie theft
    - Impersonation of an authorized user to perform actions within their access rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting malicious JavaScript/HTML payloads into the add/edit form fields on vulnerable pages.
- Vulnerable pages are located under:
    - `/ar/config/configuation/`
    - `/ar/config/risk-strategy-control/`
- User interaction is required to trigger exploitation: an attacker must either trick the victim into loading a malicious URL, or wait until a user opens a page containing the stored XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable form fields to insert the malicious payload.
- They must either trick users into visiting a crafted URL or rely on users accessing a page containing the stored XSS payload to trigger exploitation.
- The attacker does not require high privileges; a low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS score is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.3 or later.
- The proof of concept uses the payload `<img src="#" onerror=alert(1)>`.
