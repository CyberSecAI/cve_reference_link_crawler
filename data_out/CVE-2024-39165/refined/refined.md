- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JpGraph Professional Version library includes a QR Code demo application that allows writing arbitrary data to files. The application does not properly sanitize the input data, especially when using the EPS image format, allowing the injection of arbitrary code. Additionally, there is no filtering of the file extension, which allows creating files with executable extensions (e.g., .php).

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unauthenticated arbitrary file write
    - Lack of input sanitization of the data field
    - Lack of file extension filtering
    - Insecure demo application in production

- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by writing a malicious PHP file and then accessing it through the web server.

- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `qr_image.php` script with the `data` parameter containing PHP code, the `imgformat` parameter set to `eps`, and the `filename` parameter set to a `.php` extension.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the JpGraph library and have access to the affected demo application. No authentication is required.
