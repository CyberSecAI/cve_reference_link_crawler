The content is related to CVE-2023-2794.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `decode_deliver()` function within the ofono SMS decoder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The `decode_deliver()` function lacks proper bounds checking when copying data into the `out->deliver.ud` buffer using `memcpy`. The size of the copy is determined by `expected`, which is derived from the SMS PDU, potentially exceeding the buffer's capacity.
-  The `decode_submit()` function has the necessary bound checks but the `decode_deliver()` function is missing them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overflowing the stack buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be triggered by a specially crafted SMS message.
- The attack scenario is assumed to be accessible from a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or simply through SMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted SMS message to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker could be in control of a malicious base station or have compromised a modem.
