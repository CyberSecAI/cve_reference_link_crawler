Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-36667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Couchbase Server Windows UI allows an attacker to traverse the filesystem due to insufficient input validation or sanitization of the URL path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-provided input in the URL, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
- Lack of authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially access any files and folders that the Couchbase Server process has access to on the Windows file system. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information, configuration files, or other critical data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by appending folder/file paths to the Couchbase Server admin UI's URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Couchbase Server instance, specifically the admin UI.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.
