Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within SQL queries. Specifically, the `edit_imageId` and `edit_imageDelete` parameters are not properly handled before being incorporated into database queries.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided values passed through the `edit_imageId` and `edit_imageDelete` parameters.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not use prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Instead, it directly concatenates user-supplied input into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, configuration details, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation/Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `edit_imageId` and `edit_imageDelete` parameters of HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
