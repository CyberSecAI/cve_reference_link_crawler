Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure design of the "Online Railway Reservation System" where user-supplied data from the reservation form is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the admin's reservation page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code injected through the ticket reservation form is stored in the system and executed when an administrator views the reservations page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Cookie Theft:** A successful exploit could lead to the theft of the administrator's cookies. With the stolen cookies, an attacker could potentially impersonate the administrator and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Ticket Reservation Form:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the 'firstname', 'midname', and 'lastname' fields of the ticket reservation form accessible to users. This form is located at `http://localhost/orrs/?page=reserve&sid=1` in the provided examples.
- **Admin Panel:** The attacker then relies on the administrator viewing the reservation list at `http://localhost/orrs/admin/?page=reservations`. This page renders the user-submitted data without proper sanitization, triggering the stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Publicly Accessible Reservation Form:** The attacker needs to access the public-facing ticket reservation form.
- **No Special User Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges in the application to exploit this flaw.
- **Admin Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator accesses the reservation list in the admin panel.
