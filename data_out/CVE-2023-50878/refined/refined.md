- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MStore API plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows and the user's role.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action, typically by visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link that makes a request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in user of the WordPress site to a malicious website or link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
