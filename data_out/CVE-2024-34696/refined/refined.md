- **Root cause of vulnerability:** GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API expose all environment variables and Java properties to any authenticated administrator user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. The system discloses sensitive information, such as database passwords, API keys, tokens, and other secrets through environment variables and Java properties. This data is exposed via the status page and API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can access sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data stores, other systems, or services integrated with GeoServer.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via the GeoServer web interface through the "Server Status" page and REST API endpoint `/geoserver/rest/about/status`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative rights within the GeoServer application. While default configurations limit API access to the same origin, it could be exploited via XSS if an attacker gains admin credentials.
