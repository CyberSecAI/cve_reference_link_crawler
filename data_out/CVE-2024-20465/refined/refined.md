- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces (SVIs) when an administrator enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An access control list (ACL) bypass vulnerability. IPv4 ACLs configured on an SVI are not correctly evaluated after enabling and disabling REP on an uplink interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured ACLs, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over network resources, though the specific impact is limited to the bypass itself.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending network traffic through an affected device with a misconfigured ACL after REP was enabled/disabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the affected device remotely. They do not need authentication.
