Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Elasticsearch's handling of deeply nested pipelines during document processing on ingest nodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: Processing a document with a deeply nested pipeline can lead to excessive resource consumption on the Elasticsearch node.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS):  Exploiting this vulnerability can cause an Elasticsearch node to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can send a crafted document with a deeply nested pipeline to an Elasticsearch ingest node.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send documents to an Elasticsearch ingest node.
- The attacker needs to have privileges required to create or modify pipelines. (The CVSS vector indicates high privileges are needed. 'PR:H' means "High privileges required.")

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Elasticsearch versions 7.0.0 before 7.17.19 and 8.0.0 before 8.13.0.
- The issue is resolved in Elasticsearch versions 7.17.19 and 8.13.0.
- The CVSS score is 4.9 (Medium).
- NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of Elasticsearch may be affected.
- NetApp has identified some products under investigation and a long list of unaffected products.
