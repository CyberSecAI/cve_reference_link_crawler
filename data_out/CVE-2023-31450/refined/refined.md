The vulnerability is exploited through network access by an authenticated user with write permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with write permissions within the PRTG environment.

**Affected Components:**
The vulnerability affects the following SQL v2 sensors:
- ADO SQL v2 sensor
- Microsoft SQL v2 sensor
- MySQL v2 sensor
- Oracle SQL v2 sensor

**Versions Affected:**
PRTG Network Monitor version 23.2.84.1566 and earlier are affected.

**Fix:**
The vulnerability is fixed in PRTG Network Monitor version 23.3.86.1520.
