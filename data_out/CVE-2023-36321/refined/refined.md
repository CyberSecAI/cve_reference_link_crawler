Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36321:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing check for negative index values within the `dlt_file_message` function in the `dlt-daemon` software. Specifically, when accessing messages in a DLT (Diagnostic Log and Trace) file, the index used to access a particular message was not validated for negative values, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-127: Buffer Under-read:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer under-read. The code attempts to access a memory location using a negative index, which is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer, which is used to store the parsed DLT messages.. This is a type of out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact observed was a crash of the `dlt-sortbytimestamp` binary. This was due to the invalid memory access, leading to program termination.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash indicates a potential for denial-of-service. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious DLT file or input that triggers the negative index access, causing the application to crash and become unavailable.
*  **Unspecified Impact:** The Debian security advisory mentions that buffer overflows and memory leaks may lead to a denial of service or other unspecified impact, indicating that there could be other consequences not fully explored.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DLT File:** An attacker could craft a DLT file containing corrupted or manipulated data that leads to the calculation of a negative index when `dlt_file_message` function is called. This file, when processed by `dlt-sortbytimestamp` or a similar tool using the affected library could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Fuzzing:** The original reporter used a fuzzer to generate inputs for `dlt-sortbytimestamp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to provide the application with a manipulated DLT file or otherwise influence the inputs to the `dlt-daemon` library.
*  The attacker does not need privileged access in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported by `zj3t` after auditing the source code and fuzzing the `dlt-sortbytimestamp` binary.
* The fix was implemented in commit `8ac9a08`, which added a check for negative indices within the `dlt_file_message` function.
* The fix was introduced via pull request #437.
* The vulnerability is specifically within the `dlt_common.c` file.
* The vulnerability is confirmed to be a buffer under-read which is categorized as CWE-127
* The vulnerability affects dlt-daemon versions prior to 2.18.0-1+deb10u2

In summary, CVE-2023-36321 is due to a missing check for negative index values in the `dlt_file_message` function, leading to a buffer under-read. This can be exploited by an attacker providing a specially crafted DLT file to cause a crash or denial of service.
