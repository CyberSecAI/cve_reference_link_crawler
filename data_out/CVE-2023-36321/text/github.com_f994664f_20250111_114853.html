| Hi COVESA Team! Contact us to report vulnerabilities. Summary I done dlt-sortbytimestamp(+dlt-\* binary) source code auditing . And found that the exception handling was insufficient. Since I'm not familiar with the dlt structure, I created a simple fuzzer to fuzzing the dlt-sortbytimestamp binary.  And I found a crash, and added ASAN (Address Sanitizer) to get additional information. Bug Log [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35731091/214243807-dd0f55e2-6d31-461c-9a6c-2d974c943a73.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35731091/214243892-7757c9d0-6e4d-4a6e-bc77-0c07af815822.png)  In my opinion, when the pointer is moved in the fseek() function, the crash occurs because it is moved to a place that cannot be referenced. Or, Maybe it's caused by size tampering in the header of the DLT file. But I don't know the detailed information of the DLT file.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35731091/214245650-8e466a36-5ea3-45db-aa8c-65be6718499a.png) [crash.dlt]  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35731091/214245700-7fadb855-9ab1-4064-97f5-e74f9685b6bc.png) [output.dlt]  Looking at the output file, it was confirmed that it terminated in the middle. Files I will attach it. [covesa.zip](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/files/10487695/covesa.zip)  It may not be a big deal, it may be a bug (vulnerability), but I am reporting it because I hope you guys will fix it. Thanks :) |

| Thanks [@michael-methner](https://github.com/michael-methner) :) I'm glad!! I think the fixes are perfect too. Could you please tell me the CWE of the vulnerability?  Also can you allow me to get a CVE? |

| FYI, this was assigned [CVE-2023-36321](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36321).  (I did not assign the CVE, I'm just a messanger who noticed it while triaging recently published CVEs) |
