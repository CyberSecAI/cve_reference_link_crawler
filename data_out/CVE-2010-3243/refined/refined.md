{
  "CVE-2010-3243": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of HTML content when using SafeHTML, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML. This allows execution of malicious script in the security context of the logged-on user, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site using SafeHTML."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to submit malicious HTML containing script to the application. Requires a user to visit a compromised site hosting the malicious content."
  }
}
