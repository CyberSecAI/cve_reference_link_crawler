- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Misconfiguration of authorization rules when using `requestMatchers(String)` or `requestMatchers(HttpMethod, String)` with multiple servlets, including Spring MVC's `DispatcherServlet`. The issue arises because the specified `requestMatchers` can't determine if the patterns are intended for Spring MVC or not, leading to potential authorization bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization rule application due to ambiguous pattern matching. The vulnerability allows requests to be incorrectly authorized, potentially granting access to protected resources or denying access to public resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially bypass security constraints and access resources they shouldn't have access to, or cause denial of service by preventing access to public resources.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by crafting requests to specific endpoints that are not correctly matched against their intended authorization rules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No special privileges are needed. The application must be using vulnerable versions of Spring Security and have a configuration that satisfies the conditions outlined in the description.
