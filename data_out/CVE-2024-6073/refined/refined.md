- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions when an administrator or high-privilege user visits the crafted URL.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious URL containing a crafted payload is sent to the victim and when the victim (e.g an admin) clicks the link, the payload is executed within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious script. The victim must be a user with privileges within the WordPress site.
