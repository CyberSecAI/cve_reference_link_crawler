- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/VirtualSer` page of the Tenda 4G300 router. The vulnerability occurs because the user-provided `page` parameter is read into a variable `uVar2` and then passed to the `sprintf` function without proper length validation, leading to a buffer overflow in the stack-based buffer `acStack_110`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to a lack of length checks when using `sprintf` with user-controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or achieve remote code execution (RCE) by overflowing the buffer on the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/VirtualSer` endpoint, including a `page` parameter with an excessively long string, an attacker can cause the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda 4G300 device. The attacker would likely need network access to the device's management interface.
