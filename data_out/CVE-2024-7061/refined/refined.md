Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7061

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by DLL hijacking in Okta Verify for Windows. This means the application loads a malicious DLL from an attacker-controlled location instead of the legitimate one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-22:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory - This suggests the application doesn't properly validate the paths it uses, allowing an attacker to inject their own path.
*   **CWE-427:** Uncontrolled Search Path or Element - This indicates the application searches for DLLs in locations where it shouldn't, making it susceptible to hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the Windows system. The CVSS vector string indicates a high impact on Integrity, while Confidentiality and Availability are not directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where Okta Verify for Windows will search for it and load it. This is typically achieved by leveraging insecure search paths used by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows system where Okta Verify is installed.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require administrative privileges initially, as the vulnerability allows them to escalate their privileges.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploit can be triggered without user interaction, once the malicious DLL is in place.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Okta Verify for Windows versions prior to 5.0.2.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version 5.0.2 or greater.
*   Okta Verify on other platforms is not affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.5 with vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
