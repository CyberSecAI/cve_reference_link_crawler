The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41260.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a static Initialization Vector (IV) in the `Encrypt` function of the `netbird` software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Static IV:** The encryption process uses a hardcoded, static IV instead of a randomly generated one. This makes the encryption predictable.
- **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values):** This is the identified CWE, highlighting the flaw in generating the encryption IV.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The use of a static IV compromises the confidentiality of the encrypted data. Attackers can potentially infer information about the plaintext by observing patterns in the ciphertext.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an event is saved in the SQLite events table and encrypts the "email" element in the meta map.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the system where netbird is used.
- Ability to trigger the saving of an event that includes the email meta-data.
