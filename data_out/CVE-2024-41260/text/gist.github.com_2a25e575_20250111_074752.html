|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | The encrypt function of netbird v0.28.4 was discovered to use a static |
|  | initialization vector (IV), possibly compromising the security of |
|  | sensitive data. |
|  | in the Encrypt function located in the crypt.go file (part of the |
|  | github.com/netbirdio/netbird/management/server/activity/sqlite package) |
|  | utilizes a static initialization vector (IV). This practice is known to |
|  | compromise the security of the encrypted data, as using a predictable |
|  | IV can lead to pattern leaks and potentially allow attackers to infer |
|  | information about the plaintext. |
|  | code: var iv = []byte{10, 22, 13, 79, 05, 8, 52, 91, 87, 98, 88, 98, |
|  | 35, 25, 13, 05} func (ec \*FieldEncrypt) Encrypt(payload string) string |
|  | { plainText := pkcs5Padding([]byte(payload)) cipherText := make([]byte, |
|  | len(plainText)) cbc := cipher.NewCBCEncrypter(ec.block, iv) |
|  | cbc.CryptBlocks(cipherText, plainText) return |
|  | base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(cipherText) } |
