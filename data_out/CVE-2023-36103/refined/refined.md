Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `/goform/SetIPTVCfg` interface of the Tenda AC15 router.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the `goform/SetIPTVCfg` interface, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Complete compromise of the device
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Installation of malware
    *   Denial of Service attacks
    *   Manipulation of network settings.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetIPTVCfg` interface.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, implying network access. They likely need to know the correct path to trigger the vulnerability, which seems to be publicly available. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
