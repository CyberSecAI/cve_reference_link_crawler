- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Debug Assistant plugin versions 1.4 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions on the WordPress site. Specific impacts will vary.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through CSRF, which involves tricking an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious site or clicking on a malicious link, which results in a forged request being sent to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves, but the target user must be.
