      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The DHCP client application assumes that the data supplied with the “Hostname” DHCP option is NULL terminated. In cases when global hostname variable is not defined, this may lead to out-of-bound reads and writes.",

        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to send network packets on the same network segment as the vulnerable device is required."
