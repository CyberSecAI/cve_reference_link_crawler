WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• CVE-2021-31881, CVE-2021-31882, CVE-2021-31883, CVE-2021-31884: Disable the DHCP client
and use static IP address conﬁguration instead (Note that the DHCP client is disabled by default on
APOGEE/TALON and Desigo products.)

• CVE-2021-31885, CVE-2021-31886, CVE-2021-31887, CVE-2021-31888: Disable the FTP service

(Note that the FTP service is disabled by default on Desigo products.)

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The APOGEE MEC and the MBC are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices and are an
integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The Desigo PX automation stations and operator units control and monitor building automation systems.
They allow for alarm signaling, time-based programs and trend logging.

The TALON TC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices
and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
