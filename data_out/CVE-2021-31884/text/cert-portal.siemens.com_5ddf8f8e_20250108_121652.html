GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking and communication
protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured network support in any embedded device. The
networking functionality is fully integrated into the Nucleus RTOS and supports a variety of processors
and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services ideal for applications
where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability
and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications. Since
V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart
platform.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
