| *Severity: Low*  The caddy-security plugin lacks proper user session invalidation upon clicking the ‚ÄúSign Out‚Äù button; user sessions remain valid even after requests are sent to `/logout` and `/oauth2/google/logout`. Attackers who gain access to an active but supposedly logged-out session can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.  To address this issue, review the sign-out process to identify the cause of the unexpected behavior. Ensure that the `/oauth2/google/logout` endpoint correctly terminates the user session and invalidates the associated tokens.  For more defense in depth, use the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (V3 Session Management)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x12-V3-Session-management.md#v3-session-management) to check whether the implementation handles sessions securely.
