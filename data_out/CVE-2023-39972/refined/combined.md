 ![time and date](https://www.acymailing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/time-and-date-300x300.png)  ***3 min reading – Last update: Aug 17, 2023***

At AcyMailing, our top priority is ensuring the security and reliability of our email marketing and newsletter extension. We understand the critical importance of maintaining a safe environment for your online communications and campaigns. In our continuous efforts to provide the best possible experience for our users, we recently conducted a comprehensive front-end verification to address potential vulnerabilities and strengthen our platform's security, with the help of David Jardin, head of the Joomla security team.

# Uncovering Vulnerabilities:

During our extensive assessment, we meticulously examined every aspect of AcyMailing's front-end features. This rigorous evaluation led us to identify and address four vulnerabilities that could potentially impact our users. We are committed to transparency and want to provide you with a clear understanding of these vulnerabilities, their nature, and the steps we've taken to rectify them.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**: We identified and mitigated an XSS vulnerability that could potentially allow unauthorized access to campaigns. Our team has implemented robust security measures to prevent such exploits and ensure that your data remains safeguarded.
2. **Unauthorized List Creation**: We discovered a vulnerability that could allow unauthorized users to create new mailing lists. This issue has been promptly addressed to prevent any unauthorized access or modifications to your email lists.
3. **Attachment Removal from Campaigns**: Our assessment unveiled a vulnerability that could allow for the unauthorized removal of attachments from campaigns. We have taken decisive action to eliminate this vulnerability and ensure the integrity of your email campaigns.
4. **Subscriber List Enumeration**: We identified a vulnerability that could enable unauthorized parties to get the number of subscribers in a specific list. We have enhanced our security measures to prevent any unauthorized access to your subscriber information.

## Are you impacted?

It is important to note that these vulnerabilities are applicable **only to AcyMailing Enterprise** edition and specifically when the site owner has created a **front-end campaigns management menu** in a **Joomla website**. These vulnerabilities impact the versions 6.7.0 to 8.6.3 and have been patched in the version 8.7.0.

We recognize that some of our users utilize these advanced features, and we have focused our efforts on securing this specific scenario to guarantee the safety of your data.

## How to update?

To update to the latest version of AcyMailing and benefit from this security patch, you can use the extensions update page on Joomla websites or the plugins update page on WordPress. You can also manually download the latest version from your account page (click the "Download" button once logged in on our website to be taken to your download area) then install this new version like any new extension: it will update AcyMailing if it is already installed on your website.

## Our Commitment to Security:

We want to assure all our users that your security and the reliability of AcyMailing are of utmost importance to us. Our recent front-end verification and the subsequent enhancements made to address vulnerabilities demonstrate our unwavering commitment to delivering a secure and trustworthy platform for your email marketing needs. As always, we encourage you to keep your AcyMailing installation up to date to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

Owner's reply:
Hello,

AcyMailing is fully translated in German:

If the texts are not translated on your website, you can go in the AcyMailing configuration page, tab "Languages" and click the "Edit" icon next to the German language then click the "Load the latest version from our server" button. Once loaded, click the "Save" button and refresh the page => AcyMailing should be shown in German now.

Our documentation is indeed not translated in German as none of us masters this language. This is why our documentation is written in English, so that you could activate the browser translation tool.

Note that we focus more and more on adding tips and explanations directly in AcyMailing (the "(i)" next to options) so that users only need our documentation for very specific cases.

#### [Has become buggy and pushes to 'subscribe'](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-125021)

[rookey (2).](/profile/profile/details/8533)

Posted on 06 February 2024

###### Functionality

This extension was great before but isn't anymore. Changing subscriptions in the current version produces an error message.

###### Ease of use

No easy and simple download anymore, users are required to 'register' on their website. Not matching Joomla standards.

###### Support

#### [Much Commercial - Voilating OpenSource GNU/GPL rules](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-124655)

[Varma (1).](/profile/profile/details/547763)

Posted on 27 November 2023

###### Functionality

Functionalities are there but give lot of problems with Joomla 4 & 5

###### Ease of use

Not really easy to use. Using Acymailing seems harmful and not beneficial for open-source customers.

###### Support

I purchased the extension few months ago and have generated lot of issue for me on my website, and I reached them several times still no use

###### Documentation

Since they depend on an open-source platform under the GNU/GPL, restricting users from using the entire extension after the license expires.

I used this to:
While it's acceptable to restrict users from upgrading the version or receiving continued support after the license period, controlling the entire extension not to work and running vulnerable background scripts after the license expiration is a security risk.

#### [Powerful and versatile](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-123351)

[Didier Pollez (12).](/profile/profile/details/109255)

Posted on 15 March 2023

###### Functionality

Very versatile and easy to adapt for any type of use and many add-ons for other Joomla extensions.

###### Ease of use

It takes some getting used to but once you know the basics it is easy to configure and use.

###### Support

Top support, very quick answer and solution via the forum or ticket system.

###### Documentation

Very extensive description and documentation and forum, but necessary.

I used this to:

#### [The worst upgrade ever!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122347)

[HDsports (11).](/profile/profile/details/207255)

Posted on 20 September 2022

###### Functionality

Acyba 5 to 6/7 is the worst upgrade ever. Lost lot of functionality (f.e.: add more articles in a newsletter in one step)

###### Ease of use

very complex. With Acyba 5 it was easy to create an newsletter in less minutes. But with Acyba 6/7 you spend hours without success

I used this to:
Sending newsletter to 10,000 peoples.

Insert existing articles in the newsletter

#### [Great functionality, let down by customer focus](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122307)

[Stephen Hart (2).](/profile/profile/details/323872)

Posted on 13 September 2022

###### Functionality

Very powerful with plenty of options, have used for many years. Enterprise membership provides front end functionality, which is excellent.

###### Ease of use

Some idiosyncrasies in naming of functions that make it less intuitive than it could be, but pretty good overall.

###### Support

Big watchout. Support weak and weirdly touchy. No tracking of support tickets. Got suspended from forum for pointing out lack of response.

###### Documentation

Has improved but not always keeping up with changes. Would say I find what I need quickly about 70% of the time.

I used this to:
Managing mailing lists, newsletters and membership comms for a Society.

Assigning send roles to others from front end.
Owner's reply:
Hi,

Any news about this?

###### Ease of use

It has all the ease to send emails but when your emails are not opened even 3% then it has neither ease nor result.

###### Support

Alexandre has no help to offer. He says: o unfortunately I've no "way" to rectify something as it might comes from tons of different reasons

###### Documentation

No manual available to help how to make sure of delivery of the emails as mails sent to me was also not received.

I used this to:
Sending news emails to clients. No question to by new version if there has been bad experience.

###### Functionality

I must admit that this is not a tool that I just installed. It is a tool that I have been using for over 10 years. It works great!

###### Ease of use

It is very easy to use once you get used to it. I have to say that this review is for the product acymailing essential. That is I paid 29 €

###### Support

Support is great. At least for the paying version. It is worth every cent.

###### Documentation

It is pretty self-explanatory everything. I am not sure if there is a documentation site, but at least, I did not need it.

I used this to:
I used it for 10 years. We do not want to use services like mailchimp or others, cause that would mean that We would need to transfer e-mail addresses of our subscribers to an external provider, which we are not allowed, following the GDPR Directive.
