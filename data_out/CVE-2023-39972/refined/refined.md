**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root cause lies in insufficient security measures within the front-end campaign management features of the AcyMailing Enterprise edition for Joomla websites. Specifically, the vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper input sanitization and access controls when managing campaigns via a front-end interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:** This allows for the injection of malicious scripts, potentially leading to unauthorized access to campaigns.
2.  **Unauthorized List Creation:**  Unauthorized users could create new mailing lists, violating data management and access controls.
3.  **Attachment Removal from Campaigns:**  Users could remove attachments from campaigns without authorization, compromising email integrity.
4.  **Subscriber List Enumeration:** Unauthorized parties could obtain the number of subscribers in a specific list, potentially revealing sensitive subscriber information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Potential unauthorized access to campaigns, manipulation of campaign content, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities
*   **Unauthorized List Creation:** Creation of unauthorized lists for malicious purposes
*   **Attachment Removal:** Disruption of intended campaign content and communication integrity.
