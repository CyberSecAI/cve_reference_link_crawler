Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetStaticRoute` function of the Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate input validation:** The `staticRouteNet`, `staticRouteMask`, and `staticRouteGateway` parameters from the POST request are not validated for length before being used in the `sprintf` function.
*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function copies user-provided data into a fixed-size stack buffer (`sMibValue`) without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack.
*   This can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing full control of the device or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/setStaticRoute` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to send crafted `staticRouteNet`, `staticRouteMask`, and `staticRouteGateway` parameters with excessive lengths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable device.
*   The device must be running the vulnerable firmware version (Tenda W15EV1.0 V15.11.0.14).
*   No specific authentication details are required from the provided information; however, exploitation may depend on authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `formSetStaticRoute` function
*   The `staticRouteIndex` parameter controls the index of the static route and has a limit, but the overflow occurs due to the lengths of other parameters
*   The user-controlled input is used in an `sprintf` statement that overflows a fixed-size buffer `sMibValue`.
*   A Proof-of-Concept (POC) script is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the overflow by sending a long string as the `staticRouteNet` parameter.

This information aligns with a typical stack-based buffer overflow scenario, where unchecked input leads to memory corruption.
