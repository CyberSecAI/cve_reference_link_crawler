**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or user privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know (or guess) the vulnerable endpoints within `wdt_ajax_actions.php`

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the premium version of the wpDataTables plugin.
- The vulnerable code exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 6.3.2.
