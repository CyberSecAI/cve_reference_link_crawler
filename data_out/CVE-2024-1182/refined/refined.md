Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" (CWE-427) in the AlarmWorX64 MMX Pager agent. This means the software searches for a DLL in an uncontrolled manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The application loads DLLs without verifying their origin, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by placing a specially crafted DLL in a folder where the application searches for DLLs.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder on the target machine.
*   **Low Privileges:** A user with low privileges could potentially exploit this, though the exploit itself might then run with elevated privileges depending on how the vulnerable application is executed.

**Summary of Details**

The vulnerability exists in the alarm multi-agent notification feature, specifically the Pager agent, of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64. An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location searched by the application, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.0, indicating high severity.
The affected feature is no longer part of the default installation for GENESIS64TM Version 10.97.3 and later, so users are advised not to custom install it unless specifically required.
The vulnerability is present in all versions of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 and was reported by Asher Davila and Malav Vyas from Palo Alto Networks.
