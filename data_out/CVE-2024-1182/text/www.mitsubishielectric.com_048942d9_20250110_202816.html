Description

The following five vulnerabilities exist in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64.

CVE-2023-2650  When the BACnet® Secure Connect feature is enabled in GENESIS64TM, a Denial of Service (DoS)

vulnerability due to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-7702) exists in the OpenSSL
library integrated into the products, during data validation. Note that the BACnet® Secure Connect feature is
installed in the affected versions as a beta version and is disabled by default. The vulnerability is not threatened
unless this feature is explicitly enabled.

CVE-2023-4807   When running on X86_64 CPUs supporting AVX512-IFMA instructions and the BACnet® Secure Connect

feature is enabled in GENESIS64TM, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to Improper Verification of
Cryptographic Signature (CWE-3473) exists in the Message Authentication Code (MAC) implementation in
OpenSSL library integrated into the products. Note that the BACnet® Secure Connect feature is installed in the

affected versions as a beta version and is disabled by default. The vulnerability is not threatened unless this
feature is explicitly enabled.

CVE-2024-1182   When GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 are installed with the Pager agant in the alarm multi-agent notification
feature, a malicious code execution vulnerability due to Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-4274) exists
in the feature.

CVE-2024-1573   An authentication bypass vulnerability due to Improper Authentication (CWE-2875) exists in the mobile

monitoring feature of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 when all of the following conditions are met:
-  Active Directory is used in the security setting.
-  “Automatic log in” option is enabled in the security setting.
-  The IcoAnyGlass IIS Application Pool is running under an Active Directory Domain Account.
-  The IcoAnyGlass IIS Application Pool account is included in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 Security and

has permission to log in.

CVE-2024-1574  A malicious code execution vulnerability due to Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code

('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-4706) exists in the licensing feature of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64.

Impact

CVE-2023-2650  The BACnet® Secure Connect feature using the affected library may temporary cause a Denial of Service (DoS)

condition when receiving and verifying a certificate that contains a specially crafted ASN.1 OBJECT
IDENTIFIER.

CVE-2023-4807   The BACnet® Secure Connect feature using the affected library may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition
when receiving and processing messages that contains specially crafted Message Authentication Codes (MAC).

CVE-2024-1182   An attacker may be able to execute malicious code by storing a specially crafted DLL in a specific folder.
CVE-2024-1573   A malicious unauthenticated attacker may bypass proper authentication and log in to the system.
CVE-2024-1574  An attacker may be able to execute malicious code with administrative privileges by tampering with a specific

file that is not protected by the system.
