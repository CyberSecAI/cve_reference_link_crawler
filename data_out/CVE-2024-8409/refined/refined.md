The provided content describes vulnerabilities found in the ABCD Community software, specifically:

**1. Local File Inclusion (LFI) in `show_image.php` and `otros_sitios.php`:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `image` and `sitio` parameters within `show_image.php` and `otros_sitios.php` respectively. The application directly uses these parameters to include files without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input validation and sanitization, path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `image` and `sitio` parameters, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and system files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `image` parameter in `show_image.php` and the `sitio` parameter in `otros_sitios.php` using relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the server's file system to specify the file paths for inclusion.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `buscar_integrada.php`:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Sub_Expresion` parameter in `buscar_integrada.php` is vulnerable to XSS. The application does not sanitize or encode this parameter correctly before including it in the HTML response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of output encoding or sanitization, reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will then be executed in the browsers of users accessing the page. This allows the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious page.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `Sub_Expresion` parameter with malicious JavaScript code within an HTTP request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and inject a valid XSS payload into the `Sub_Expresion` parameter.
