What are the plans for releasing it? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c4)  John Ata    2024-03-06 21:02:25 UTC  ``` I am still getting a segault on busybox 1.36.1 running the expression "echo ${0::0/0~09J}" on busybox ash built on Linux (e.g. Centos 7) with the following configuration MATH variables turned off and the other MATH variables turned on:  CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_MATH_64 is not set CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_MATH_BASE is not set  It seems that perhaps the fix is not comprehensively complete.  If these MATH variables are turned on along with the other MATH variables, there is no problem.  We seem to be claiming that CVE-2022-48174 does not exist in 1.36.1 (fixed in 1.35). But this does not seem to be necessarily true. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c5)  John Ata    2024-03-06 21:49:18 UTC  ``` It seems that 1.36.1 did not have the patch that fixes the problem even though the bug was marked as resolved fixed. I suspect that the various symbol definitions just moved things on the stack to sometimes cause problems with the incorrect allocation size. So I wonder why the CVE was marked as fixed in 1.35. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c6)  johan.malmstrom.office    2024-07-31 13:48:52 UTC  ``` As far as I can see, John Atas statement in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c4) & 5 is true. We repeated the test, with the configuration below (x86_64-buildroot-linux-gnu-gcc-12.3.0):  .config: CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_MATH_64=y # CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_MATH_BASE is not set   host:~ # ulimit -c unlimited host:~ # ash host:~ # echo ${0::0/0~09J} Segmentation fault (core dumped) ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c7)  johan.malmstrom.office    2024-07-31 13:49:43 UTC  ``` As far as I can see, John Atas statement in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15216#c4) & 5 is true.
