The provided content relates to **CVE-2024-5097**, specifically a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in SourceCodester Simple Inventory System 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection in the `tableedit.php` page, specifically when updating product prices. The application does not implement token verification when the front-end sends modified price data. The `updateprice.php` script is then directly spliced into an SQL update statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability due to the absence of anti-CSRF tokens or other appropriate mechanisms.
- Direct SQL update statement construction using user-supplied input (`$_POST['itemnumber']`), which could lead to further vulnerabilities if the value was not sanitized.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on the `$_POST['itemnumber']` parameter (although this is not directly highlighted as an SQLi vulnerability, the potential risk is mentioned).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify product prices by crafting malicious requests and tricking an authenticated user into submitting them, potentially causing financial or data integrity issues.
- Unauthorised modification of application data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to construct a malicious HTML page, and then send it to a victim that has an active session in the application. When the victim clicks on the HTML file, a request will be sent to the vulnerable endpoint, modifying the application data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/updateprice.php`.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious HTML file to a logged-in user of the application and convince them to interact with it.
- The attacker does not require access to the application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `$_POST['itemnumber']` on the route `tableedit.php#page=editprice`.
- The provided PoC HTML form sets the item price to 888.
- The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to `updateprice.php`.
