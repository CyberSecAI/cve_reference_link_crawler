Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-22817:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient restrictions on built-in functions available within lambda expressions used by the `PIL.ImageMath.eval()` function in Pillow. Although Pillow 9.0 restricted top-level builtins, it did not account for builtins accessible through lambda expressions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient input sanitization:** The `PIL.ImageMath.eval()` function, which evaluates mathematical expressions on images, was not properly sanitizing lambda expressions, allowing access to potentially dangerous built-in functions.
- **Code Injection/Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By crafting malicious mathematical expressions including lambda functions, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code by exploiting the vulnerability. This could lead to complete system compromise if the code is executed with sufficient privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** It is implied that the code execution can be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Image Files/Data:** An attacker would need to supply a specially crafted image file or data that, when processed by Pillow, would cause the vulnerable `PIL.ImageMath.eval()` function to execute malicious lambda expressions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to `PIL.ImageMath.eval()`. This could be achieved by controlling an image file or any other data that is processed through the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Pillow versions prior to 9.0.1.
-  Pillow 9.0 partially fixed the vulnerability by restricting the builtins available to `PIL.ImageMath.eval()` but did not cover lambda functions. The fix for CVE-2022-22817 was present in Pillow 9.0.1 and later versions.
-  The Debian LTS advisory DLA-3768-1 indicates that the fix for this CVE in DSA-5053-1 was incomplete and this update completes the fix.
