- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `uploadFile` method in `FileUtils.java` does not perform any filtering or validation of the file extension of uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The lack of file extension filtering allows attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can upload malicious files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the uploaded file is a web shell or other executable, or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the uploaded file contains malicious scripts and is accessed by other users. The provided example uses an SVG file to demonstrate the possibility of XSS.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/FileApi/updateimage` endpoint with a file of any extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and does not need any authentication.
