# Lexmark Security Advisories

## Security advisories for Lexmark devices

Lexmarkâs ultimate goal is to produce software and hardware that is free from security-related vulnerabilities, however, the sheer complexity of the code in the products results in the need to be able to address security-related issues in released products. Lexmarkâs software and hardware products contain hundreds of files, thousands of objects, and tens of millions of lines of code and a product that was released with no known vulnerabilities may indeed have new vulnerabilities identified over time. This can be due to a previously unidentified vulnerability found in custom code written by Lexmark, in a common shared system library, or in a third-party library integrated into the Lexmark software or firmware. Lexmarkâs security staff and experts monitor multiple channels for the identification of new security vulnerabilities including: internal review, customer service, security-focused press, security-related academic research, and technical alerts from organizations like NIST-National Vulnerability Database and US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, Lexmark uses scanning tools during the implementation phase that scan source code for out-of-date or vulnerable shared libraries.

Registration

Sign up [here](https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/GlobalPreferenceCenter.html "here") for the latest security alerts.

Identification Process

When new vulnerabilities are identified which might affect Lexmarkâs products, they are addressed via the following process:

1. The vulnerability is analyzed to determine if it affects the product. (Vulnerabilities found in shared system or third-party code libraries may not apply, depending on the way the code is used in the system).

2. Lexmarkâs security staff determines if the exploit mechanism for the vulnerability is possible in Lexmarkâs implementation.

3. If yes, then the security bug is scored using industry standard Common Vulnerability Scoring Systems (CVSS). Note: The severity score published in a technical alert may score differently in specific implementations.

4. Internal processes are initiated to log, track, patch, and test the bug fix, and updated code is provided via a patch process.

5. If the CVSS score warrants, Lexmark will issue a security advisory for the products affected.

Additional details can be found in our Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) [Whitepaper](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/white-paper/y2024/NA-SSDL-Overview_082224.pdf "Whitepaper").

Submitting an issue

For product security vulnerabilities affecting Lexmark printers, send an e-mail to securityalerts@lexmark.com.

You may use Lexmark's PGP key to encrypt sensitive information (Click [here](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/filedownloads/y2023/Lexmark-PGP-Public-Key.pem "here") to download our PGP public key).   Please also include your PGP key so we may communicate with you on sensitive issues.
