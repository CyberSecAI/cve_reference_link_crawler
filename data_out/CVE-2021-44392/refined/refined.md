- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cgiserver.cgi` process, responsible for parsing API requests, incorrectly assumes that the "param" JSON element within a request will always be an object. When a string or other non-object type is provided, it leads to an assertion failure and a subsequent device reboot due to the lack of a heartbeat from the `cgiserver.cgi` process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20) in the JSON command parser of the `cgiserver.cgi` application. Specifically, the code does not properly handle cases where the "param" JSON element is not an object.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit results in a denial of service condition, causing the device to reboot. This can disrupt the functionality of the security camera.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint, with a JSON array in the request body containing a specific command and a "param" element that is not a JSON object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. In many cases, this requires authentication. However, the report mentions that TALOS-2021-1420 can be leveraged to bypass authentication requirements in order to exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service.
