The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52829.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing validation of the `reg_cap.phy_id` value extracted from a WMI event within the `ath12k_wmi_ext_hal_reg_caps` function of the ath12k driver. This value is used as an index to access the `soc->hal_reg_cap` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists. If `reg_cap.phy_id` has an unexpected value greater than or equal to `MAX_RADIOS`, it will lead to an out-of-bounds write to `soc->hal_reg_cap`.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to memory corruption. Although the provided information does not specify further impact such as privilege escalation, it could potentially lead to system instability, crashes or arbitrary code execution depending on the context and how the memory is used.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted WMI event that contains an invalid `phy_id` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to interact with the ath12k driver by sending specially crafted WMI events. This likely requires a position that has control over the wireless communication or some level of access to the system where the driver is running.
