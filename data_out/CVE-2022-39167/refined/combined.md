After upgrading to a fixed code level, the following steps should be taken if you have enabled the IP Quorum feature:

* Request a new system certificate
* Redeploy the IP Quorum app

The recommendation to replace the system certificate applies regardless of whether the current certificate is self-signed or signed by a certificate authority.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

If you are unable to immediately upgrade, the following options are available to mitigate this issue if you have enabled the IP Quorum feature:

Option 1: Stop using IP Quorum until you are able to upgrade to a fixed code level

* Disable IP Quorum
* Request a new system certificate

Note that this can be detrimental for systems using Enhanced Stretched Cluster or HyperSwap, or those with multiple I/O groups, which may no longer have a quorum device accessible to all nodes if IP Quorum is disabled.

Option 2: Continue using IP Quorum but redeploy the app and strictly control access to the JAR file

* Request a new system certificate
* Generate and download a new IP Quorum app JAR file
* Immediately delete the JAR file from the system once it has been downloaded (navigate to Settings > Support Package in the management GUI and click "Delete Logs", then search for **ip\_quorum.jar**).
* Restrict permissions on the JAR file so that it can only be read or executed by a trusted administrator.
* Impose strict access controls on the server the IP Quorum app is running on
* Copy the JAR file to the servers that are designated for running the IP Quorum app and deploy the new version

Note that the IP Quorum JAR file is the root cause of this security exposure, so must be carefully protected at all time.
