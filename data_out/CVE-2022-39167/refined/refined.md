- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the IP Quorum feature on IBM Spectrum Virtualize. The IP Quorum JAR file is cited as the root cause of the security exposure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Loss of confidentiality in private communications between the management GUI and clients.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Loss of confidentiality in private communications between the management GUI and clients.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation of the IP Quorum feature via a vulnerable JAR file. The exact method of exploitation is not specified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would likely need some level of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability, as the JAR file is referenced as the root cause.

The vulnerability affects the IP Quorum feature, specifically a JAR file, and can result in loss of confidentiality. The recommended fixes include upgrading to specified code levels and replacing the system certificate, along with redeploying the IP Quorum app. If upgrades are not feasible, workarounds include disabling IP Quorum or strictly controlling access to the JAR file and the server on which the IP Quorum app is running.
