- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fromSetWirelessRepeat` function uses `strcpy` to copy the value of the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter into a buffer without checking the length of the input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A stack overflow can be triggered, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/fromSetWirelessRepeat` with an overly long `wpapsk_crypto` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target device on the local network, likely requiring access to the same network segment as the router.
