The provided content is related to CVE-2023-39527.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Validate::isCleanHTML` method of PrestaShop. This method is intended to sanitize HTML input, but it contains a flaw that allows for XSS injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `isCleanHTML` method fails to properly sanitize HTML input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through HTML attributes like `on*` events. The fix adds additional `onpointer*` events to the regex to catch these exploits.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of web pages
*   Data theft
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, leveraging the application's input sanitization vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have high privileges, meaning they need to be able to submit HTML input that is processed by the vulnerable `isCleanHTML` method. User interaction is also required, meaning a user with high privileges needs to be tricked into submitting the malicious input.
