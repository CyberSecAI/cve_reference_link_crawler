Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect file permission being set for the `grub.cfg` file during the `grub-mkconfig` process. A previous commit inadvertently discarded the umask used for creating this file. As a result, the file was created with a permission of 0644, which allows unprivileged users to read its content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect File Permissions:** The `grub.cfg` file was created with world-readable permissions (0644) instead of the intended 0600, which should restrict access to only the owner.
- **Confidentiality Risk:** The `grub.cfg` file may contain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unprivileged local users can read the `grub.cfg` file and potentially gain access to sensitive information such as password hashes. This could allow them to compromise the system or gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to read the `grub.cfg` file. They don't need root or admin privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a user account on the system, meaning they have local access to the file system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided git commit message directly references `CVE-2021-3981`.
- Red Hat Bugzilla also confirms this issue as `CVE-2021-3981`.
- The fix involves restoring the umask to ensure the file is created with the correct 0600 permission, preventing unauthorized access.
- The issue was present in grub2 versions prior to 2.06 and was addressed in version 2.06 or later.
- The vulnerability is considered a low-severity confidentiality issue.
