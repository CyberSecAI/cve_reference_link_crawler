The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40395.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in PTC ThingWorx v9.5.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The application allows an authenticated user to access resources they shouldn't have access to by directly manipulating parameters in the HTTP requests. Specifically, the "Organization name" parameter can be altered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can view sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), regarding vehicles, drivers, users, and other information belonging to different organizations within the system, regardless of their access level.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is by sending crafted HTTP requests to specific endpoints after obtaining valid credentials for PTC ThingWorx.
- The attack relies on manipulating the "Organization name" parameter in POST requests to the listed endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the PTC ThingWorx application.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and modify the "Organization name" parameter.

**Affected endpoints:**
- `POST /Thingworx/Things/PostgreSQLNew/Services/VehicleProfile_NewV5?`
- `POST /Thingworx/Things/PostgreSQL/Services/Driver_Pages_New_V3?`
- `POST /Thingworx/Things/UsersThing/Services/GetUsersByOrganizationMultiQ?`
