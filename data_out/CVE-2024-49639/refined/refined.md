- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Monitor.chat WordPress plugin, versions 1.1.1 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, which falls under the OWASP Top 10 category A3: Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will execute when guests visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin itself and potentially through user input or other methods that allow injection of code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
