- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `helpers.restoreState` function in the `@ais-ltd/strategyen` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution. It allows modification of `Object.prototype` by processing input containing the `__proto__` property.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype pollution vulnerability in the `helpers.restoreState` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype, potentially leading to denial of service, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By calling the `helpers.restoreState` function with a crafted argument that includes the `__proto__` property.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `helpers.restoreState` function with attacker-controlled input.
