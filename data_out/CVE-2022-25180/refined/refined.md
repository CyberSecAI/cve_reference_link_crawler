*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pipeline: Groovy Plugin includes password parameters from the original build in replayed builds.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information disclosure. Specifically, password parameters are exposed during replay of a build.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with "Run/Replay" permission can obtain the values of password parameters passed to previous builds of a Pipeline.
*   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when replaying a build of a Pipeline that used password parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have "Run/Replay" permission for the affected Jenkins Pipeline job.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected plugin is `Pipeline: Groovy Plugin` (`workflow-cps`).
*   Affected versions are `2648.va9433432b33c` and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in version `2656.vf7a_e7b_75a_457` by preventing builds with password parameters from being replayed.
