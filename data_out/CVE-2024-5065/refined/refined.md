Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the `regno` parameter within the PHPGurukul Online Course Registration System. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (`regno`) into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of the application:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
*   **Data Access/Modification:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Further Exploitation:** The attacker could potentially leverage the database vulnerability to exploit other vulnerabilities in the system, gaining further control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request targeting the `index.php` file, specifically injecting SQL code into the `regno` parameter. The vulnerable URL is identified as `http://localhost/onlinecourse/index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication, meaning any attacker can attempt to exploit it over the network.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application to send the malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided source is a GitHub markdown file describing the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was submitted to VulDB and assigned entry ID 264924.
*   The vulnerable parameter `regno` is located at `http://localhost/onlinecourse/index.php`.
