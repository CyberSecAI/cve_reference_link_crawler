- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Foxit PDF Reader handles Doc objects within AcroForms. Specifically, there's a lack of validation to ensure an object exists before performing operations on it. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability, potentially arising from improper handling of object lifecycle within AcroForm processing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process, potentially gaining control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code path in AcroForms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to craft a malicious PDF file or a web page to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction (opening the file or visiting the page) is required for the exploitation.
