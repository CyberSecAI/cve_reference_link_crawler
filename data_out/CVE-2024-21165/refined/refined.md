- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple NetApp products incorporate Oracle MySQL Server. MySQL Server versions through 8.0.37 are susceptible to an easily exploitable vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a high-privileged attacker with network access to compromise MySQL Server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can result in a complete denial of service (DOS) of the MySQL Server, causing a hang or frequently repeatable crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access via multiple protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** High privileged attacker with network access.
