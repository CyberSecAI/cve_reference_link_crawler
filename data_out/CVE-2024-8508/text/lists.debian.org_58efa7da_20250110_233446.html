Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3952-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : unbound
Version        : 1.13.1-1+deb11u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-8508
Debian Bug     : 1083282

A vulnerability has been discovered in unbound, a validating,
recursive, caching DNS resolver. Malicious upstreams responses with
very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time
applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to
degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well
orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious
actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a
malicious zone with very large RRsets.

For Debian 11 bullseye, this problem has been fixed in version
1.13.1-1+deb11u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unbound>
