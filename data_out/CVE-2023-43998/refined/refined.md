Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of secret in books-futaba

**Affected Product:** books-futaba (Line mini-app)

**Affected Version:** v13.6.1

**Vulnerability Type:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The mini-app 'books-futaba' exposes its channel access token to the client-side. This token, which is intended to secure the communication channel within Line, is included in the response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the channel access token, a critical credential for communication within the Line platform.
- **Client-Side Exposure:** The token is exposed directly in the client-side response, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the network traffic or the application's data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Broadcasts:** An attacker who obtains the channel access token can use it to broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'books-futaba' mini-app. This includes sending malicious links, fraudulent information, and other harmful content.
- **User Risk:** Users are at risk of receiving unsolicited and potentially harmful messages, leading to potential phishing, malware distribution, or other forms of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could intercept network traffic to obtain the channel access token from the response of `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`.
- **Application Inspection:** Anyone with the Line app installed can access the mini-app and, by inspecting network requests, obtain the token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Line App:** An attacker needs access to the Line app on their device.
- **Ability to Initiate Network Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a request to the specified URL, `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`, either through manual interaction with the mini-app or through a custom network request.
- **Network Traffic Analysis (Optional):** While not strictly required, the attacker may need to analyze network traffic to identify the request and the channel access token within the response.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided document includes a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including screenshots of the vulnerable response.
- The document emphasizes that the channel access token should be kept secret and that its exposure can lead to the broadcast of malicious messages.
- The vulnerability affects all users of the 'books-futaba' mini-app on the Line platform.
