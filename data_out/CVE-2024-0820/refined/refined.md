Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Jobs for WordPress" versions prior to 2.7.4 do not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the "Working Hours" field when creating a job posting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the "Working Hours" field is stored in the database and executed when a user views the job posting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Working Hours" field when creating or editing a job posting. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Contributor level access or higher to create/edit job postings. 
- The attacker can inject the malicious script, which will be triggered when an administrator or other user with higher privileges previews or publishes the page.
