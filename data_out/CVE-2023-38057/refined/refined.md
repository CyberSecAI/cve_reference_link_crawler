Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in OTRS Survey modules when handling free text answers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization on free text answers in survey module.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into free-text answers of surveys.
- When an authenticated agent views the survey replies, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the agent's session

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs a link to a valid and unanswered survey request.
- The attacker provides a specially crafted free text answer containing malicious javascript code.
- When the authenticated agent views the survey response, the malicious script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the survey.
- The attacker needs the capability to submit a survey request, with the vulnerable free text field, with malicious script as a response.
