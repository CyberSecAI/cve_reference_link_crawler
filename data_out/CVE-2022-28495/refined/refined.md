- Root cause of vulnerability: The `setWebWlanIdx` function in the TOTOLINK CP900 firmware contains a command injection vulnerability due to the webWlanIdx parameter not being properly sanitized.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Command injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted web request that includes malicious commands in the webWlanIdx parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the vulnerable TOTOLINK CP900 device.
