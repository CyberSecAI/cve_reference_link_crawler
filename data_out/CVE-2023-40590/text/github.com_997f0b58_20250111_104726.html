# Untrusted search path on Windows systems leading to arbitrary code execution

## Package

pip

gitpython
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.1.32

## Patched versions

3.1.33

## Description

### Summary

When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory, and after that the PATH environment (see big warning in <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor>). GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's `PATH`.

### Details

This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo.

The execution of the `git` command happens in

[GitPython/git/cmd.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/cmd.py#L277)

|  | universal\_newlines=universal\_newlines, |
|  | creationflags=PROC\_CREATIONFLAGS, |
|  | \*\*subprocess\_kwargs, |
|  | ) |

And there are other commands executed that should probably be aware of this problem.

### PoC

On a Windows system, create a `git.exe` or `git` executable in any directory, and import or run GitPython from that directory

```
python -c "import git"

```

The git executable from the current directory will be run.

### Impact

An attacker can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands.

### Possible solutions

* Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.EXE` (default git path installation).
* Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on Windows systems.
* Make this problem prominent in the documentation and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path.
* Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable (suggested by [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron))

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
