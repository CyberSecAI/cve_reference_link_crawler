Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the `$ID` parameter in the `pda/approve_center/check_seal.php` file of Tongda OA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `$ID` parameter is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
*   The provided exploit examples show the ability to extract the database name.
*   Further exploitation could lead to data manipulation or complete database takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to the `check_seal.php` endpoint, with a malicious payload injected into the `ID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.
*   Basic knowledge of SQL and web application interaction is required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Tongda OA versions v11.2 to v11.10.
*   The attacker is using boolean-based blind SQL injection to extract database information.
*   The exploit uses SQL functions like `DATABASE()` and `substr()` to extract the database name character by character.
*  The provided examples use  `information_schema.columns`  to verify the SQL injection is working.
