- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Livemesh Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress, in versions 8.5 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before outputting it in a webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into a website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, which are then executed when other users visit the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts, which is possible through plugin's unsanitized input fields that output to the front-end. The required privilege to inject is 'Contributor'.
