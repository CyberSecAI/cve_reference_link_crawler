Alert
# Ivanti Releases Security Update for Cloud Services Appliance

Last RevisedSeptember 13, 2024

Ivanti has released a security update addressing an OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-8190) affecting Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) 4.6 (all versions before patch 519). A cyber threat actor could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system.

At this time, Ivanti has confirmed limited exploitation and urges its customers using the affected versions to upgrade to CSA version 5.0. Ivanti no longer supports CSA 4.6 (end-of-life).

CISA recommends users and administrators review CISA and FBI's joint [guidance on eliminating OS command injections](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-eliminating-os-command-injection-vulnerabilities) and the [Ivanti security advisory](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Cloud-Service-Appliance-CSA-CVE-2024-8190?language=en_US&_gl=1*6frqvp*_gcl_au*MTIzMDUyNTU2My4xNzE4ODgyNzE0) and apply the recommended updates.

**Note**: CISA has added CVE-2024-8190 to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), which, per [Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities), requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the specified due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.
