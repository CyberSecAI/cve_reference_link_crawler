Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-34149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apache Struts handles list bounds when accessing properties, specifically related to the `XWorkListPropertyAccessor`. The `autoGrowCollectionLimit` was implemented for `setProperty()` but not `getProperty()`.  If `CreateIfNull` is set to true for an underlying Collection type field, accessing a non-existent element can lead to uncontrolled memory allocation due to a lack of proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** The core issue is the unchecked growth of a collection, leading to excessive memory allocation.
- **Improper Input Validation**: Specifically, the vulnerability arises because of the lack of proper checks on list bounds when getting properties via `getProperty()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition by causing the application to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a crash or making the service unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By accessing a non-existent element in a collection where the `CreateIfNull` property is true for the underlying collection type field, an attacker can trigger the uncontrolled memory allocation, leading to a DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger actions that would cause the Struts application to attempt to get a property of a collection with the `CreateIfNull` option enabled. This typically implies that the attacker needs to send a specific request to the server that causes the problematic logic to be executed.
- The attacker can be authenticated or unauthenticated, according to the NetApp advisory (from the CVSS score)

**Additional details from the content:**
- Affected versions: Apache Struts through 2.5.30 and 6.1.2
- The vulnerability was introduced due to the changes in  [WW-4620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-4620).
- A workaround is available which consists of setting `CreateIfNull` to false for Collection type fields. By default this option is disabled.
- Upgrading to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater resolves the issue.
