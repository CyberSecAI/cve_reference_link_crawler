- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CPT Shortcode Generator plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could include actions such as modifying plugin settings, adding malicious shortcodes, or other actions the plugin enables.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted request that the victim user is tricked into executing while they are authenticated to the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request, and a higher-privileged user (e.g., admin) needs to be logged into the WordPress site and tricked into triggering this request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
