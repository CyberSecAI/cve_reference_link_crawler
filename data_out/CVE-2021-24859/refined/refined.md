- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin registers a shortcode that allows users with a role as low as contributor to access other users' metadata by specifying the user login as a parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Broken access control: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to user metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Data exfiltration: Attackers can extract sensitive user information, including password hashes.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Shortcode injection: Attackers can insert the vulnerable shortcode into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "contributor" role.
