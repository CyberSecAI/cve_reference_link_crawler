## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Meta Shortcodes <= 0.5 - Contributor+ Unauthorized Arbitrary User Metadata Access

### Description

The plugin registers a shortcode that allows any user with a role as low as contributor to access other users metadata by specifying the user login as a parameter. This makes the WP instance vulnerable to data extrafiltration, including password hashes

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following shortcode in a post/page [otheruserinfo login="admin" field="user\_pass"][/otheruserinfo]

### Affects Plugins
