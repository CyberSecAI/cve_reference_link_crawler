In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kobject_uevent: Fix OOB access within zap_modalias_env()

zap_modalias_env() wrongly calculates size of memory block to move, so
will cause OOB memory access issue if variable MODALIAS is not the last
one within its @env parameter, fixed by correcting size to memmove.
