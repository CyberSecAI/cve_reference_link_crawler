Graylog 5.1 introduces the Cluster Support Bundle, allowing you to bundle any useful information from your Graylog cluster for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

Navigate to *System* > *Logging* to access this modal. From here, select *Create Support Bundle*, and Graylog will generate a zip file containing cluster and version information as well as some useful logs and files. Once generated you can download the zip file locally for review.

**Warning:** This zip file may include **sensitive information**, such as IP addresses, passwords, etc. Examine it carefully before sending it anywhere!

## Cluster Support Bundle for Graylog Operations

The following section exclusively pertains to a [Graylog Enterprise](../../../../../../Users/AnnieZempel/OneDrive%20-%20Graylog%2C%20Inc/What%20Is%20Graylog/What%20is%20Graylog%20Operations.html) feature. To learn more about obtaining an Enterprise license, please contact [the Graylog Sales team](https://go2.graylog.org/contact-sales).

Graylog Operations users may utilize the Cluster Support Bundle to send information about their Graylog cluster to the Support team. You can attach your zip file directly to support tickets in the [customer support portal](https://support.graylog.org/).

# Partial path traversal vulnerability in Support Bundle feature

Low

[bernd](/bernd)
published
GHSA-2q4p-f6gf-mqr5
Jul 5, 2023

## Package

Graylog

## Affected versions

>= 5.1.0

## Patched versions

5.1.3

## Description

A partial path traversal vulnerability exists in Graylog's [Support Bundle](https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-1/making_sense_of_your_log_data/cluster_support_bundle.htm) feature. The vulnerability is caused by incorrect user input validation in an HTTP API resource.

Thanks to weiweiwei9811 for reporting this vulnerability and providing detailed information.

### Impact

Graylog's Support Bundle feature allows an attacker with valid Admin role credentials to download or delete files in sibling directories of the support bundle directory.

The default `data_dir` in operating system packages (DEB, RPM) is set to `/var/lib/graylog-server`. The data directory for the Support Bundle feature is always `<data_dir>/support-bundle`.

Due to the partial path traversal vulnerability, an attacker with valid Admin role credentials can read or delete files in directories that start with a `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle` directory name.

The vulnerability would allow the download or deletion of files in the following example directories.

* `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle-test`
* `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundlesdirectory`

For the [Graylog](https://hub.docker.com/r/graylog/graylog) and [Graylog Enterprise](https://hub.docker.com/r/graylog/graylog-enterprise) Docker images, the `data_dir` is set to `/usr/share/graylog/data` by default.

### Patches

The vulnerability is fixed in Graylog version 5.1.3 and later.

### Workarounds

Block all HTTP requests to the following HTTP API endpoints by using a reverse proxy server in front of Graylog.

* `GET /api/system/debug/support/bundle/download/{filename}`
* `DELETE /api/system/debug/support/bundle/{filename}`

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-41044

### Weaknesses

[CWE-24](/advisories?query=cwe%3A24)

* Fix filename validation in Support Bundle handling

The previous implementation of "SupportBundle#ensureFileWithinBundleDir"
was affected by a partial path traversal vulnerability and allowed
authenticated users with the Admin role to download or delete files in
sibling directories of the support bundle data directory.

See: [GHSA-2q4p-f6gf-mqr5](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-2q4p-f6gf-mqr5 "GHSA-2q4p-f6gf-mqr5")

* Add changelog snippet

* Fix bundle download with relative data_dir config

* Fix test for the assertj version we are using in 5.1

* Fix another test case
