- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks for AJAX actions, specifically `post_grid_paginate_ajax_free` and `post_grid_ajax_search_free`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control. Password-protected posts are disclosed to unauthenticated users via AJAX requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated users can read the content of password-protected posts.
- **Attack vectors**: By making specific AJAX requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication and can be a remote user.
