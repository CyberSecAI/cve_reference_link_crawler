Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-48257:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of raw SQL queries in the `get_worked_modes()` function within the `application/models/Oqrs_model.php` file. Specifically, the `$station_id` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because user-supplied input (`$station_id`) is directly inserted into the SQL query, an attacker can manipulate the query by injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that the related controller function (`get_qsos()` in `application/controllers/Oqrs.php`) does not perform user authentication. This means an attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing valid user credentials, resulting in an Unauthenticated SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive data from the database, including user information and logs.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** By injecting specific SQL code, an attacker might be able to cause database errors or overload the system, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario, an attacker might be able to leverage SQL injection to gain further control over the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `get_qsos()` function of the `Oqrs` controller. The attacker would manipulate the `station_id` parameter.
*   **Direct SQL Injection:** The SQL injection is directly achieved by crafting the malicious payload within the `station_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Wavelog application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required due to the lack of authentication in the vulnerable controller.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct an HTTP POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates the ability to execute time-based blind SQL injection and boolean based blind SQL injection. This verifies the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `application/models/Oqrs_model.php` within the function `get_worked_modes`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `station_id` POST parameter being used directly in a SQL query.
*   The vulnerability is classified as HIGH with a CVSS score of 7.3.
