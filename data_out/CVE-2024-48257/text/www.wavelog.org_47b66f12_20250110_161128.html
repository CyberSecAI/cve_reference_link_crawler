## About Wavelog

The work on this project started at the end of 2023 as a spin-off of the well-known amateur radio software Cloudlog. The four core developers – DF2ET, DJ7NT, HB9HIL and LA8AJA – who have pushed Cloudlog forward for months and years, decided to continue their work in a fork that led to Wavelog. Since its initial release on February 1st, 2024, Wavelog has made tremendous progress in terms of stability and functionality. We are proud that Wavelog is developed by radio amateurs for radio amateurs, without commercial motives, but out of pure passion for the hobby. Every line of code is the result of hard work to continuously improve this great piece of software. Wavelog stands for its simplicity, powerful tools, and open-source code. As a web application, Wavelog offers the great advantage of being accessible from anywhere in the world. Whether on a professional server, rented webspace or a RaspberryPi at home, Wavelog makes it possible to manage your logbook anytime, anywhere. Try it yourself and experience improved web-based logging on your server.

Wavelog is an

non-profit,
non-commercial,
open-source project.

Just because it is fun.
