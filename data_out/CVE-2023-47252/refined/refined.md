Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-47252

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient data size verification within the PNP software SMI sub-functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Lack of proper bounds checking when handling data within System Management Mode (SMM) communication buffers.
-  Specifically, the PNP software SMI sub-functions do not validate the size of incoming data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to tamper with data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the PnpSmm component.
- The vulnerability is within SMM communication buffers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a high level of privileges within the system (PR:H).
-  The attack requires physical access to the system (AV:P).
- A high level of access complexity is required (AC:H).
- User interaction is not required for the attack (UI:N).
- The scope of the attack is changed (S:C).
- The attack results in high integrity impact (I:H), but no confidentiality (C:N) or availability (A:N) impact.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is located in the System Management Mode (SMM)
- The provided solution includes updated kernel versions for various branches (5.2 to 5.6), which indicates that the vulnerability is located in a kernel component.
