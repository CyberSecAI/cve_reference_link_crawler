### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2024-29041](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd
https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2024-29041](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd
https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-29041](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc "CVE-2024-29041")](<https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc>)

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta
versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect
vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL
Express performs an encode [using
`encodeurl`](<https://togithub.com/pillarjs/encodeurl>) on the contents
before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed
URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list
implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via
bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called
from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

[expressjs/express@0867302](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd)

[expressjs/express@0b74695](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94)

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature
regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in
`4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either
`require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take
on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or
`res.redirect`.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-29041](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta
versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect
vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL
Express performs an encode [using
`encodeurl`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents
before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed
URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list
implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via
bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called
from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd

https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature
regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in
`4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either
`require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take
on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or
`res.redirect`.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2024-29041](https://togithub.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://togithub.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd
https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.
