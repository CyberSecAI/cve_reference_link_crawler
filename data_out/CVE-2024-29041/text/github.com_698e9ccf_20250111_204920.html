# Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs

Moderate

[wesleytodd](/wesleytodd)
published
GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc
Mar 25, 2024

## Package

npm

express
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.19.2
>=5.0.0-alpha.1, <5.0.0-beta.3

## Patched versions

4.19.2
5.0.0-beta.3

## Description

### Impact

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.

The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

### Patches

[0867302](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd)

[0b74695](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94)

An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.

### Workarounds

The fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
