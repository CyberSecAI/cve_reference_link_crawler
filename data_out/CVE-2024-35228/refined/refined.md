Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improperly applied permission check in the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module. This module manages settings within the Wagtail CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient permission checks: A user with access to the Wagtail admin panel and knowledge of the edit view URL of a settings model can access and update the settings even without the required explicit permissions over the model itself.
- The permission check for editing settings was not correctly enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access and modification: An attacker could potentially access and modify application settings they should not have access to. This could include sensitive configurations.
- Integrity compromise: The ability to alter settings could lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or even a complete takeover of the application depending on the manipulated settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack occurs over the network through the Wagtail admin interface.
- Exploitation requires knowledge of the URL of the edit view for the specific settings model.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Wagtail admin panel is a prerequisite.
- The attacker must know the specific URL to access the edit view for the setting to be exploited.
- The attacker does not need explicit permission to access/modify the specific model.
