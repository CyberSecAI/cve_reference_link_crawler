- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-controlled input when generating XML export of Jira issues
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the XML export, potentially leading to malicious actions on the user's browser when the exported XML is viewed
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting specific input into the Jira issue, an attacker can inject malicious code that is triggered when the XML export is generated and viewed
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify issue data in a vulnerable Jira instance.
