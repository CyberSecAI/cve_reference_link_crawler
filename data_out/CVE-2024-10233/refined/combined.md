### Description

The SMS Alert Order Notifications – WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's sa\_subscribe shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Once your demo credits are finished, this plugin will not send any messages, you can then decide to purchase the credits. In case you do not want to purchase, ensure to disable all OTP options from the plugin, so that your website can function normally.

### [LIFE SAVER PLUGIN](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/life-saver-plugin-23/)

This plug in works like a charm and the support is great.
affordable sms’s sent out to client via the orders we get so instead of customers maybe getting an email (should their mail block yours) then they get a sms which is great especially on EFT orders with the detail sent and notificed when orders complete.

### [Awesome plugin for WpForms](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/awesome-plugin-for-wpforms/)

[Giordano](https://profiles.wordpress.org/giordanomorotti/ "Posts by Giordano")

I use this plugin for phone verification on WpForms. It is very easy to set up, it works perfectly and the user interface in completing the verification is the best I have seen in any wordpress plugin.

The plugin has more than the functionalities that one would expect.
Login with OTP.
Register with OTP.
Order verification with OTP for configurable payment type orders.
Tera wallet messages.
and so on.
Wonderful support provided on top of it 🙂

Using for two days only, but found this plugin really great. It has every functionality, which I needed – custom status(all) sms, Terra wallet credit sms and many more. Integrated with my shipment tracker easily. They provide very fast support and solved all my problem within a day. Highly recommended
