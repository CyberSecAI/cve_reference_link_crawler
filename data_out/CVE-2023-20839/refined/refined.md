The provided content is related to the CVE-2023-20839.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing valid range check in the `imgsys` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The lack of proper range validation allows the system to read memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local information disclosure. Specifically, an attacker with System execution privileges could potentially read sensitive information from memory locations beyond the intended bounds.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to execute code on the target device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have system execution privileges on the vulnerable device to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is needed for exploitation.
