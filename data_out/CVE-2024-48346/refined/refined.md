Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation on the `fileUrl` parameter in the `/api/data/upload` endpoint. The application directly uses the provided URL to make a request, without any checks to ensure it's an allowed or safe destination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes an HTTP request to a URL specified by the user, leading to an SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Request Execution:** An attacker can force the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external systems.
- **Information Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially use the application as a proxy to scan internal infrastructure or exfiltrate data to an external domain they control.
- **Potential for further attacks:** This vulnerability can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks like data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/data/upload` endpoint.
- Including a malicious URL in the `fileUrl` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker doesn't require authentication, as the provided example includes a bearer token, but this does not seem to be a focus of the vulnerability itself.
- The attacker needs to be able to control or observe the results of the requests sent from the server.

**Additional Details:**

- The attacker provided example includes the usage of `dnslog.cn` to confirm the SSRF.
- The issue report explicitly mentions the affected version as `v0.9.1`.
- The provided example request includes other parameters such as `datasetId`, `source` and `dataFormat`, which seem unrelated to the vulnerability.
