- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly restrict access to saved log files, resulting in directory listing being enabled for the `saved_logs` directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory listing is enabled on the `saved_logs` directory. This leads to sensitive data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can read and download PHP logs, which could contain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can access the `saved_logs` directory via a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the location of the `saved_logs` directory within the WordPress installation (`wordpress/wp-content/plugins/error-log-viewer/saved_logs`). No authentication or special privileges are needed to access the directory and download the log files.
