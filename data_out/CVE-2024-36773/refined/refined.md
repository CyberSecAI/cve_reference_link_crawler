The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36773.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Monstra CMS application where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed back to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. Specifically, the `Themes` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1. The attacker needs to log into the admin panel of the Monstra CMS.
    2. The attacker navigates to a specific theme editing page such as `/admin/index.php?id=themes&action=edit_template&filename=index` or one of the other mentioned endpoints.
    3. The attacker inserts a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`, into the content of a theme or chunk.
    4. The attacker saves the changes.
    5. When the user views the affected page, the payload is executed, resulting in the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Monstra CMS in order to exploit the vulnerability.
