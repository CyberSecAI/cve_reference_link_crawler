In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-glue: Fix of_k3_udma_glue_parse_chn_by_id()

The of_k3_udma_glue_parse_chn_by_id() helper function erroneously
invokes "of_node_put()" on the "udmax_np" device-node passed to it,
without having incremented its reference count at any point. Fix it.
