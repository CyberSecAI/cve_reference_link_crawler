Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A misconfigured build script in the `airtable.js` package was bundling environment variables into the browser build. Specifically, `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL` were being included in the generated bundle when referenced in the code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintentional inclusion of the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` within the browser build of the library, potentially exposing sensitive API keys.
*   **Build Process Misconfiguration:** The core issue stems from the build script's failure to properly exclude environment variables during the bundling process, which was using `envify` to inject the environment variables.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized API access:** If the bundled `airtable.js` code containing the API key is distributed, attackers could extract the key and gain unauthorized access to the corresponding Airtable account.
*   **Data Breach/Modification:** With access to the API key, attackers could potentially view, modify, or delete data stored in the associated Airtable base.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Accidental Distribution of Bundled Code:** The primary attack vector involves a developer who cloned the `airtable.js` source code, ran the `npm prepare` script (triggering the problematic build process), and then inadvertently distributed the modified bundle containing the API key (e.g., by including it in their website or application).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (Potentially):** While less likely, an attacker who could intercept the distribution channel might also be able to access the bundled javascript and extract the API key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to a copy of the modified `airtable.js` code bundled by a developer who cloned the repository, ran the build script with the environment variable set.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability only affects developers who build `airtable.js` from the source using `npm prepare` with the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable set. Users who install `airtable.js` through npm or yarn are not affected.
*   The fix involves modifying the build script to explicitly mask out the environment variables `AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` using the `envify` transform by setting them to empty strings during the build process.
*   The fixed version of the package is `0.11.6`.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to `airtable.js` version `0.11.6` or higher, unsetting the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable, and regenerating any Airtable API keys that were used during affected builds.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
*   CVSS v3 base metrics are: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H which translates to: Network Attack Vector, High Attack Complexity, High Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Scope Changed, High Confidentiality, High Integrity, High Availability
