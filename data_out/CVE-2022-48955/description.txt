In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: thunderbolt: fix memory leak in tbnet_open()

When tb_ring_alloc_rx() failed in tbnet_open(), ida that allocated in
tb_xdomain_alloc_out_hopid() is not released. Add
tb_xdomain_release_out_hopid() to the error path to release ida.
