Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of HTTP requests within the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. This lack of validation allows for path traversal attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the presence of a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) due to inadequate input sanitization or validation of user-supplied data in HTTP requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit grants an attacker read access to sensitive files on the affected system. This could lead to the exposure of configuration files, sensitive data, or other confidential information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences (e.g., `../`) to the vulnerable system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have network access to the affected system's web-based management interface. They can be remote, but must have valid login credentials.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases 20.1.12 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Release 20.1.2 contains the fix for this vulnerability.
