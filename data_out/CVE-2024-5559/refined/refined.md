- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327). This is exploited when a specially crafted reset token is entered into the front panel of the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service, device reboot, or an attacker gaining full control of the relay. This could result in loss of protection to the electrical network.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the front panel of the device where a specially crafted reset token is entered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Physical access to the device is required for exploitation. The attacker must be able to input a crafted reset token.
