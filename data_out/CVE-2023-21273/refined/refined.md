```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds write occurs in `SDP_AddAttribute` when `attr_pad` becomes full. An index of `-1` is computed, which results in writing a zero byte to `p_val` outside of the allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted Bluetooth SDP request. The vulnerability is classified as a proximal/adjacent attack vector, which suggests the attacker must be in physical proximity to the device being targeted, for example, within Bluetooth range.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device and able to send a crafted Bluetooth SDP request to trigger the vulnerability."
