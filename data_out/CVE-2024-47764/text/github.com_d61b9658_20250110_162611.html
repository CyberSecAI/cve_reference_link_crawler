# Cookie name, path, and domain accept out of bounds characters

Oct 4, 2024

## Package

npm

cookie
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.7.0

## Patched versions

0.7.0

## Description

### Impact

The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize("userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a", value)` would result in `"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.

A similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.

### Patches

Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.

### Workarounds

Avoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.

### References

* [#167](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167)

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47764

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
