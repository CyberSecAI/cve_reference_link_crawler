            --------------
            Fix vulnerability in CallRedirectionService.Currently when the CallRedirectionService binding died, we didn't doanything, which cause malicious app start activities even not run in thebackground by implementing a CallRedirectionService and overriding theonPlaceCall method to schedule a activity start job in an independentprocess and then kill itself. In that way, the activity can stillstart after the CallRedirectionService died. Fix this by unbinding theservice when the binding died.Bug: b/289809991Test: Using testapp provided in bug to make sure the test activity can'tbe started(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:29b52e3cd027da2d8644450a4dee3a7d95dc0043)Merged-In: I065d361b83700474a1efab2a75928427ee0a14baChange-Id: I065d361b83700474a1efab2a75928427ee0a14ba
