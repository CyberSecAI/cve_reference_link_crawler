*  **Impact:** An attacker can modify on-demand DAST scans and leak protected and masked CI/CD variables.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is network-based.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to trigger DAST scans (i.e. a low privilege user).
