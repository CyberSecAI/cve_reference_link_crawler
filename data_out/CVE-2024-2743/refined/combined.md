# GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7

Learn more about GitLab Critical Patch Release: 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 17.3.2, 17.2.5, 17.1.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important bug and security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all self-managed GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version. GitLab Dedicated customers do not need to take action.

GitLab releases fixes for vulnerabilities in patch releases. There are two types of patch releases:
scheduled releases, and ad-hoc critical patches for high-severity vulnerabilities. Scheduled releases are released twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesdays.
For more information, you can visit our [releases handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of GitLab release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).

For security fixes, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are committed to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest patch release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.
