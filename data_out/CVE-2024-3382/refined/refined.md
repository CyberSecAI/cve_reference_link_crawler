- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly manage memory allocation, leading to a memory leak when processing crafted packets. This is a CWE-770 issue: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send a burst of crafted packets through the firewall, which leads to the firewall being unable to process traffic. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based and involves sending specially crafted packets to the firewall.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable firewall. The attack complexity is rated as high because the packets have to be crafted in a specific way to trigger the memory leak. The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to execute the attack. The attack requires the SSL Forward Proxy feature to be enabled on PA-5400 Series devices.
