### Description

A memory leak exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables an attacker to send a burst of crafted packets through the firewall that eventually prevents the firewall from processing traffic. This issue applies only to PA-5400 Series devices that are running PAN-OS software with the SSL Forward Proxy feature enabled.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cloud NGFW | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.1 | < 11.1.2 | >= 11.1.2 |
| PAN-OS 11.0 | < 11.0.4 | >= 11.0.4 |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | < 10.2.7-h3 | >= 10.2.7-h3 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | None | All |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | None | All |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | None | All |
| Prisma Access | None | All |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue applies only to PA-5400 Series devices that are running PAN-OS firewall configurations with the SSL Forward Proxy feature enabled. You can verify whether you have the SSL Forward Proxy feature enabled by checking for decryption policy rules in your firewall web interface (Policies > Decryption).

### Severity: HIGH, Suggested Urgency: MODERATE

CVSS-B:
8.2 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/V:D/RE:L/U:Amber](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/V:D/RE:L/U:Amber))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 10.2.7-h3, PAN-OS 11.0.4, PAN-OS 11.1.2, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

You can mitigate this issue by disabling decryption on your firewalls. To temporarily disable SSL Decryption, refer to the administrator’s guide for your PAN-OS software (such as PAN-OS 11.1: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/decryption/temporarily-disable-ssl-decryption>). Additionally, to ensure that decryption remains disabled after a reboot, configure a policy-based decryption exclusion that excludes all traffic from being decrypted (<https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/decryption/decryption-exclusions/create-a-policy-based-decryption-exclusion>).
