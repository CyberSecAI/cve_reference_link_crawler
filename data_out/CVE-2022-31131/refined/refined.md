Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing ownership check when updating or deleting mail attachments within the Nextcloud Mail app. Specifically, the `local_message_id` was used as the sole identifier when manipulating attachments, without verifying if the user performing the action was actually the owner of the attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application failed to properly validate the user's ownership of the attachments before allowing modification or deletion, leading to an authorization bypass.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application directly used the `local_message_id` without additional user context for attachment manipulation, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if a malicious actor were to discover or manipulate this value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Integrity Loss:** An attacker can overwrite the `local_message_id` for draft attachments, effectively removing them from the sender's view and making them unusable for the original sender.
- **Data Availability Loss:** An attacker can delete attachments of other users, making them unavailable to the original sender.
- **No Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker cannot access the content of the attachments or send them to other users. They can only delete or overwrite association between the attachment and the mail.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- The attacker needs to make requests to the server to modify the attachments associated with a message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Nextcloud instance with access to the mail app
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance to send the malicious requests.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided content gives specific details about the vulnerable code locations which include  `lib/Db/LocalAttachmentMapper.php`, `lib/Db/LocalMessageMapper.php`, `lib/Service/Attachment/AttachmentService.php`, `lib/Service/OutboxService.php`. It also highlights the specific methods within these files that were vulnerable.
- The content details the fix, which involves adding user ID checks to various functions like `findByLocalMessageId`, `deleteForLocalMessage`, `saveLocalMessageAttachments`, and `findByIds` within the `LocalAttachmentMapper`. These changes ensure that actions on attachments are only allowed if the user performing the action is the owner of the attachment.

In summary, CVE-2022-31131 was a vulnerability in the Nextcloud Mail app that allowed attackers to manipulate other users' draft attachments by exploiting missing ownership checks. This could lead to data unavailability and integrity issues. The patch introduced user ID checks to ensure that actions on attachments are only permitted for their respective owners.
