published
GHSA-xhv7-5mhv-299j
Jul 6, 2022

## Package

Mail
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 1.12.2

## Patched versions

1.12.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker is able to overwrite the local\_message\_id for draft attachments or delete them, making it unavailable for the actual sender in both cases. It is not possible to send the attachment to another user or to access it.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail app is upgraded to 1.12.2 .

### Workarounds

No workaround available

### References

* [Pull request](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/pull/6600)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31131
