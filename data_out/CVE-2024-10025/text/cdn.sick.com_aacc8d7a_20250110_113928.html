WHY CYBERSECURITY MATTERS

At SICK, Cybersecurity covers the entire product life cycle. The increa­
sing digitalization and growing network complexity of production
plants increases the risk of cyberattacks. These attacks can originate
inside or outside the production network (for example, they can come
from the Internet or from wireless interfaces). For this reason, a com­
prehensive cybersecurity strategy is essential.

BACKGROUND SICK Operating guidelines

Transmitting data securely and protecting systems
against manipulation by hackers present an incre­
asing challenge, in particular due to the growing
number of networks in Industry 4.0 environments.
Today’s Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are IP­
addressable and connected. ICS and IT systems
increasingly connect and communicate, and more
ICS are remotely accessible than ever before.

The foundation for securing industrial networks
requires the following: Deep insight into control
plane communication protocols such as OSPF, IS­IS
or BGP drawing the network topology; the capability
to scan the network, identify devices, take invento­
ry of devices present, snapshot their settings and
continuously monitor activity on
devices to detect unauthorized changes.

Role of asset owner
The asset owner is a person or organization responsible for
operation and maintenance of a system. The asset owner has
the responsibility to install and maintain security measures.
With the aid of standards, an asset owner can implement an
Information Security Management System.

Most asset owners rely on corporate IT measures, i.e.
firewalls and air gaps to reduce the attack vector on ICS.
Both measures reduce the number of possible connections
to the device. An air­gapped computer or network is one that
has no network interfaces connected to outside networks.

When designing a network architecture for an ICS, network security
can be achieved by introducing well­established design solutions for
isolating and protecting network segments. Practical considerations,
such as cost of ICS installation or maintaining a homogenous network
infrastructure, often mean that a connection is required between
the ICS and the corporate network. These architectural aspects are
e xplained in the following sections.

Network segmentation into zones
Dividing the network architecture into zones
differentiated by function to match the standards
proposed in ISA­95 as closely as possible allows
an infection to be contained within a single zone.
This makes it difficult for an attacker to spread an
attack to other zones. There should be at the very
least three separated areas:
 • Network Control
 • “demilitarized zone” (DMZ)
 • corporate local area network (LAN) –

also referred to as “Office LAN”

The aim of network segmentation is to minimize
access to sensitive information for systems and
people without access permission.

Encryption of communication
and logical isolation
Encryption of communication and logical isolation
can be achieved using virtual private network (VPN)
and virtual local area network (VLAN) technologies
between zones. This measure also serves to avoid
an infection spreading from one zone to another.
Controlling and filtering of traffic by means of
firewalls , proxies and elements intended to identify
and separate traffic and communications at the
l evel both of the network (IP, routing) and of the
port, protocol and applications layer helps detect
an infection when it attempts to cross over to
another zone.

Extending security to the data­link
and application layers
This brings in security measures for the data­link
layer, such as access controls in accordance with
802.1x and filtering by media access control (MAC)
address, and for the applications level through the
use of a web application firewall (WAF).

Access controls based on whitelisting
Such controls implement rules for access based on
recognized elements and deny access to all others.
One area of considerable variation in practice is
the control of outbound traffic from the control
network, which could represent a significant risk if
unmanaged. One example is a malware that uses
HTTP tunneling to exploit poorly defined outbound
rules. In addition to these rules, the firewall should
be configured with outbound filtering to stop forged
IP packets from leaving the control network or the
DMZ. In practice, this is achieved by checking the
source IP addresses of outgoing packets against
the firewall’s respective network interface address.
The intent is to prevent the control network from
being the source of spoofed (i.e., forged) communi­
cations, which are often used in Denial of Service
(DoS) attacks.

GENERAL SECURITY PRACTICES SICK Operating guidelines

Wireless networks involve an additional risk
Wireless networks should be implemented only
when absolutely necessary or because of a
specific decision by the organization and always
with clear justification. In their case, IEEE 802.1x
mechanisms are used for authentication, including
extensible authentication protocol transport layer
security (EAP­TLS), which authenticates clients with
certificates, can be used in combination with a
RADIUS server. Access points should be situated

on networks that are isolated or have the minimum
possible interconnections with the ICS control
n etwork (none at all, if this can be achieved).
A  r obust protocol for wireless communications,
such as WPA2 Enterprise with CCMP, should be in
place and additionally a characteristic and unique
service set identifier (SSID) should be used, with
broadcast deactivated, but with filtering by MAC
address in operation.

AVAILABILITY

In industrial control systems, latency and the transmission speed of
messages are critical factors. These factors determine whether the
design of the control network is able to face up to potential problems
of congestion or loss of connectivity. Recommendations for enhancing
the resilience of a network to these problems include:

 • Using switches that add network functionalities to segment a VLAN and prioritize

certain types of traffic on the basis of quality of service criteria.

 • Using redundant topologies to bolster availability as well as implementing the

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to keep control of the formation of network loops.
 • Using the internet group management protocol (IGMP) together with a VLAN to

provide better performance and restrict multicast messages in accordance with
the type of traffic and the devices concerned.

REMOTE ACCESS

If access from infrastructures external to the control network is
necessary, the use of VPN solutions would bring the encryption and
authentication necessary to protect the connection. Specialized soft­
ware, hardware, or both, should be used for remote access, together
with suitable security policies in relation to updates, and to managing
access and users.
