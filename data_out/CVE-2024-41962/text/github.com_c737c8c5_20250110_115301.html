You really need to be clever on writing code when it comes to security. Sometime you think this would be fine, But one day it proves that your code has problem with it.

And that's what happened here. This is a bit serious if you use bostr only for private, So please update your bouncer as this is a major version for that.

## what's new

* Fix bostr let everyone in even having `authorized_keys` being set when `noscraper` is set to `true`.

## upgrading

* npm: `npm upgrade bostr@3.0.10` and restart
* source: `git pull && npm install` and restart
* bun: `git pull && bun install` and restart
