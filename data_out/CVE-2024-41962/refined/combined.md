[`2a0c641`](/Yonle/bostr/commit/2a0c641133541792d2b8dc2de786d80c48c416c3)

You really need to be clever on writing code when it comes to security. Sometime you think this would be fine, But one day it proves that your code has problem with it.

And that's what happened here. This is a bit serious if you use bostr only for private, So please update your bouncer as this is a major version for that.

## what's new

* Fix bostr let everyone in even having `authorized_keys` being set when `noscraper` is set to `true`.

## upgrading

* npm: `npm upgrade bostr@3.0.10` and restart

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
