{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `app_name` and `createApp` functions within `/SkycaijiApp/admin/controller/Develop.php`. The `app_name` function directly concatenates the provided `$copyright` and `$identifier` without sanitization. Subsequently, `createApp` uses this concatenated string to construct a file path, where the attacker controls the `$name` parameter. This allows for arbitrary code injection into the generated PHP file by inserting malicious code within the `$name` parameter, especially using `/*` and `*/` to comment out surrounding code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization/validation and arbitrary file creation/modification. Specifically, the lack of sanitization in `app_name` function and the lack of filtering of the `$name` parameter in `createApp` function allows for path traversal and arbitrary code injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into a generated file, which is then executed when the file is accessed, leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/index.php?s=/Admin/Develop/func`. The attacker manipulates the `module`, `copyright`, `identifier`, `name`, and `methods` POST parameters to inject malicious PHP code into a file that will later be executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the web application to access the vulnerable endpoint `/Admin/Develop/func`. Also, the attacker needs to know the application's URL to send the malicious HTTP POST request."
