  "CVE-2023-21134": {
    "description": "The vulnerability in this section could lead to elevation of privilege. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
    "root_cause": "The commit message indicates that if the device isn't set up yet, access to permission settings should be restricted. This suggests the vulnerability lies in improper access control to permission settings during the device provisioning process. Specifically, the `ManagePermissionsActivity` should finish if device is not provisioned, meaning that the activity was accessible even when the device was not provisioned.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
       "Improper Access Control",
       "Lack of Restriction during device provisioning"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to permission settings before the device is fully set up, allowing them to change permissions of applications, which may lead to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct access to ManagePermissionsActivity before device provisioning"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker could be an application or service trying to access the ManagePermissionsActivity before the device has been provisioned. No user interaction is required."
