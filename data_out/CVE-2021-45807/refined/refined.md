  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure installation of malicious plugins in the JPress system. The `io.jpress.web.admin._AddonController.doUploadAndInstall` method handles file uploads and plugin installations. This method reads plugin information using `AddonUtil.readAddonInfo`, which creates a class loader to load classes from the plugin. This process allows an attacker to introduce malicious code into the system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure plugin installation",
      "Lack of proper validation and sanitization of plugin code",
        "Use of a classloader to load plugin classes without sufficient security checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). By uploading a malicious plugin, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload of a malicious plugin through the admin interface",
         "Direct HTTP request to a vulnerable controller method"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Access to the JPress admin panel (requires a valid username/password).",
        "Ability to upload files to the server",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin installation endpoint."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the plugin installation process of the JPress system, specifically within the `io.jpress.web.admin._AddonController` and `AddonUtil` classes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted plugin containing malicious code. The JPress team acknowledges the vulnerability but stated they won't fix it, saying that it's a user awareness issue since the system relies on user-uploaded plugins"
