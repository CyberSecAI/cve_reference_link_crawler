## THE JOURNEYMAN DIFFERENCE

#### This is what sets us apart.

### ***You’ll never worry about the status of your job.***

Starting the minute we receive your project, our team will update you on every step of your schedule and keep you informed until completion.

###

### ***We’re known for our “Yes” mentality.***

Journeyman Press has a distinctive can-do attitude from the top-down (Dana Thoms hates to say “No”).

### ***We’re proactive communicators.***

Our sales and service reps can give you daily information that includes production schedule updates, receipt of materials, shipping confirmation, and more.

### ***You’ll always get options and creative ideas.***

Quotes are typically turned around the same day, and we can offer you options to save money, fix an issue, enhance the printing, or shorten production time.

### ***We have a 98% on-time delivery record.***

For years we’ve tracked our delivery records, and it’s with extreme pride that we can say that 98% of our projects are delivered on time or earlier.

### ***We do what we say.***

Giving customers our word that a job will get done as expected, for the price agreed upon, and delivered as promised is how we conduct our business.
