**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the application.
- **Data Corruption:** It allows a malicious actor to potentially write sensitive data to arbitrary memory locations.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The attack vector is through parsing a maliciously crafted 3DM file within Autodesk applications that use the `opennurbs.dll` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious 3DM file.
- User interaction is required. The user must open the malicious 3DM file using the vulnerable Autodesk software.

**Affected Products:**
- Autodesk AutoCAD, Advance Steel and Civil 3D and other products listed in the advisory.
- Impacted versions are 2025, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the mitigated versions of affected products (2025.1, 2024.1.5, 2023.1.6, 2022.1.5).
