### Security advisory CVE-2024-41805 (severity 6.1 / moderate)

This release fixes a few reflected XSS vulnerabilities which enabled execution

of malicious JavaScript in the context of a user’s browser if that user clicks

on a malicious link, possibly allowing retrieval or modification of the current

user's data. The issue is of moderate severity (score 6.1/10) with the CVSS

rating CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

I want to thank Alec Romano for reporting the issues.

### New features

* The test suite now uses always the same Dockerfile as the main build.
* The Dockerfile now supports environment-specific builds via stages.

  Note: This requires slight changes to docker build commands, see documentation!

### Deprecations

* This will be the last release to support Ruby 3.0, which is already end-of-life.

### Bug fixes

* Lots of dependencies have been updated (including security updates).
* Fixed Docker build not working on an archive version (ie. one not cloned with Git)
* An error is shown if the user being created already exists.
* The TOS error in user creation is now in template.
* Schema.rb has been updated for Postgres support.

### Updated translations

* Spanish (thanks Gallegonovato!)
* Finnish (by maintainer Jyri-Petteri ”ZeiP” Paloposki)
