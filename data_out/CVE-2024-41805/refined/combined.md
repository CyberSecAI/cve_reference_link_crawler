Moderate

published
GHSA-fp4p-59hr-3695
Jul 25, 2024

## Package

tracksapp/tracks
(Docker Hub)

## Affected versions

<2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Tracks software enable execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of a user’s browser if that user clicks on a malicious link, possibly allowing retrieval or modification of the current user's data.

### Patches

The problems have been patched in Tracks version 2.7.1.

### Workarounds

There are no complete workarounds for the problems.

### Reported by

* Alec Romano [@4rdr](https://github.com/4rdr)

### Fixed by

* Jyri-Petteri Paloposki [@ZeiP](https://github.com/ZeiP) (Ardcoras oy)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Security advisory CVE-2024-41805 (severity 6.1 / moderate)

This release fixes a few reflected XSS vulnerabilities which enabled execution

of malicious JavaScript in the context of a user’s browser if that user clicks

on a malicious link, possibly allowing retrieval or modification of the current

user's data. The issue is of moderate severity (score 6.1/10) with the CVSS

rating CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

I want to thank Alec Romano for reporting the issues.

### New features

* The test suite now uses always the same Dockerfile as the main build.
* The Dockerfile now supports environment-specific builds via stages.

  Note: This requires slight changes to docker build commands, see documentation!

### Deprecations

* This will be the last release to support Ruby 3.0, which is already end-of-life.

### Bug fixes

* Lots of dependencies have been updated (including security updates).
* Fixed Docker build not working on an archive version (ie. one not cloned with Git)
* An error is shown if the user being created already exists.
* The TOS error in user creation is now in template.
* Schema.rb has been updated for Postgres support.

### Updated translations

* Spanish (thanks Gallegonovato!)
* Finnish (by maintainer Jyri-Petteri ”ZeiP” Paloposki)
