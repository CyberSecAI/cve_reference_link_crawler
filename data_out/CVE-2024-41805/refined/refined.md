Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input in the Tracks application, specifically in the `todos_controller.rb`, `application.html.erb`, and `show_selection_from_chart.html.erb` files, which results in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weaknesses are reflected XSS vulnerabilities (CWE-79). This occurs because the application is displaying user-provided data without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the context of the Tracks application. This could lead to:
- Retrieval or modification of the current user's data.
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking on it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to:
-  Craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code.
-  Trick a victim into clicking the link.

The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N), however the exploit requires user interaction (UI:R).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of Tracks prior to 2.7.1.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.7.1.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered "moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.1.
- The scope of the vulnerability is "changed" (S:C), meaning that a successful exploit can affect resources beyond the directly impacted component.
- The impact includes low confidentiality (C:L) and low integrity (I:L) concerns, while availability is not impacted (A:N)
- Patches were implemented by sanitizing the user input via `sanitize()` method in `todos_controller.rb` and  `j` (escape javascript) method in `application.html.erb` and by converting the params to integers in `show_selection_from_chart.html.erb`.
