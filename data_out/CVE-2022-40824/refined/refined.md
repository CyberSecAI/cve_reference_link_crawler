The provided content discusses a potential SQL injection vulnerability in CodeIgniter 3.x, specifically when using the `_wh()`, `_where_in()`, and `_like()` functions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises because these functions do not sanitize or filter user-supplied input used as database field names. If a developer improperly uses user-controlled input to define the field in a database query, it can lead to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The core weakness is that user-controlled data used as field names is not escaped or validated, allowing for injection of arbitrary SQL code. The `information_schema` is mentioned, indicating that the attacker could potentially use this to extract information about the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The discussion mentions a related authentication bypass vulnerability. While not explicitly in the provided content, a comment references a video demonstrating that an empty or manipulated where clause can lead to this kind of exploit.
*   **Full Database Control:** Depending on the database setup and permissions, it's possible that an attacker could manipulate database contents, delete data, or escalate privileges if the SQLi is severe enough.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Input:** The attack vector relies on a developer's mistake of using unsanitized user-provided input to dynamically define database field names in SQL queries. This is often done through GET or POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Application:** The attacker needs to understand how the application constructs SQL queries and how user input is used within the SQL queries. Specifically, they need to know that the application isn't sanitizing field name input.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Input:** The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the user input that is used to construct the SQL query.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The application must be running CodeIgniter 3.x with the described vulnerability.
