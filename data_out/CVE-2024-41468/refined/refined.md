Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the `exeCommand` function of the Tenda FH1201 router. Specifically, the `cmdinput` parameter, which is expected to contain a command to be executed by the system, is copied to stack space (variable `v7`) without any filtering or validation before being executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Since the input from `cmdinput` is directly executed, an attacker can inject malicious commands by including shell metacharacters, like `;` in the provided proof of concept (POC).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete compromise of the router, enabling the attacker to potentially:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the network
    *   Install malware
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data
    *   Deny service to legitimate users
    *   Use the compromised device as part of a botnet

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint on the router's web server.
*   **`cmdinput` Parameter:**  The `cmdinput` parameter in the POST request is where the malicious command is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This usually means they need to be on the same local network or have some way to reach the router's web interface through the internet (if exposed).
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP POST requests to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker must know about the vulnerable `exeCommand` endpoint and how to exploit it using a command injection payload within the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided POC demonstrates a simple command injection using the `ls` command. An attacker could use this to execute much more dangerous commands.
*   The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1201 v1.2.0.14.
* The vulnerability is located in the `exeCommand` function.
