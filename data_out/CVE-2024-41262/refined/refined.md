- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The immudb v1.9.3 uses the HTTP protocol in the `ShowMetricsRaw` and `ShowMetricsAsText` functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS for sensitive data transmission. This exposes the communications to potential interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can intercept communications via a man-in-the-middle attack, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Using the `immuadmin stats` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack between the `immuadmin` client and the `immudb` server.
