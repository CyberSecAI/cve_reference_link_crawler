Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue in the Piotnet Forms plugin for WordPress. This means that a function within the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Specifically, the plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is that an unprivileged user can perform actions they should not be allowed to. The specific impact depends on the function affected by the broken access control, which is not detailed in this report.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper access control checks to execute restricted functions within the plugin.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning an unprivileged and even a completely unauthorized user can potentially exploit this vulnerability.

The report also mentions:
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.0.29 of the Piotnet Forms plugin.
*   It is fixed in version 1.0.30.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
