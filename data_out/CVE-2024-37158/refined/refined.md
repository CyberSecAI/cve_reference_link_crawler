{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The spendable balance calculation for clawback vesting accounts was incorrect when delegating vested tokens. Additionally, checks on actions by clawback vesting accounts were inconsistent between Cosmos and Ethereum ante handlers, and there was a missing check when creating a validator.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect spendable balance computation after delegation.",
        "Inconsistent ante handler checks between Cosmos and Ethereum transactions.",
        "Missing check when creating a validator with vested tokens."
      ],
      "impact": "Clawback vesting accounts could prematurely access unvested tokens by delegating them and then transferring the spendable balance. Additionally, they could bypass Cosmos ante handler checks using Ethereum transactions, and create validators using vested tokens.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Delegating vested tokens.",
        "Sending Ethereum transactions targeting precompiles.",
        "Creating a validator with vested tokens."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have control over a clawback vesting account and be able to perform transactions on the Evmos network, including delegation, sending Ethereum transactions, and creating validators."
    }
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The issues have been patched in versions >=V18.0.0."
