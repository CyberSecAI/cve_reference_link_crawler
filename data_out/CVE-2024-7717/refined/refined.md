Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Time-Based SQL Injection

**Affected Component:** WP Events Manager plugin for WordPress

**Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 2.1.11

**Root Cause:** Insufficient escaping of user-supplied input in the `order` parameter and inadequate preparation of the SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `order` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query is not constructed using parameterized queries or prepared statements, allowing direct injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation/Destruction:** While the primary exploit is focused on data extraction (time-based), the potential exists for more severe attacks like data modification or deletion, depending on the database user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP requests.
*   **Parameter Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the `order` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Subscriber-level access.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be knowledgeable about SQL syntax and time-based injection techniques to craft appropriate payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `posts_orderby` function of the `class-wpems-post-types.php` file. This function handles sorting of events in the WordPress admin panel.  The `$_REQUEST['orderby']` parameter, which is directly taken from the user input, is used within the construction of the SQL query without proper sanitization or use of prepared statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query and control how the database performs the sort, which through carefully constructed time-based payloads allows for information to be exfiltrated.

**Remediation:**

*   Upgrade to version 2.2.0 or later where the vulnerability is patched.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided code snippets from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` confirm the vulnerable code in versions prior to 2.2.0 and provide the fixed code in version 2.2.0.
