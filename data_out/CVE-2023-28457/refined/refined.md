{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of random UDP ports for outbound requests on the Windows platform, making it susceptible to DNS cache poisoning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Non-random UDP ports used for outbound requests",
       "Insufficient validation of DNS responses"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject fake DNS responses into the DNS cache of the Technitium DNS server within 1 second.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends a DNS query to the Technitium DNS server and injects fake DNS responses to poison its cache.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS responses to the target Technitium DNS server."
