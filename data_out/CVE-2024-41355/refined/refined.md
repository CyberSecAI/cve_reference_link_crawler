The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41355.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The `ip_addr` parameter from the POST request is directly inserted into the HTML without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding for the `ip_addr` parameter in the `/app/tools/request-ip/index.php` file.
- The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- When a user visits the page, the script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing cookies and credentials.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/app/tools/request-ip/index.php` with a malicious payload in the `ip_addr` parameter.
- The server reflects the unsanitized payload in the HTML input field's `value` attribute.
- The victim's browser executes the injected script when rendering the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
