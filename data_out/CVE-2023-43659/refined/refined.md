    "root_cause": "Improper escaping of user input in the digest email preview UI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Reliance on CSP for security rather than proper escaping."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. The impact is considered High due to the potential for significant compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs low privileges (e.g., a regular user account) and requires user interaction (e.g., user viewing a maliciously crafted email preview). The attacker must be able to inject malicious code into user input that is displayed in the digest email preview UI.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is only exploitable on sites that have CSP disabled. Enabling CSP mitigates this vulnerability."
