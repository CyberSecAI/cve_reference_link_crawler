Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the length of a `drm_event` structure within the `vmwgfx` driver's fence signaling mechanism. Specifically, the code was using the size of the parent structure instead of the size of the `drm_vmw_event_fence` structure, which is the intended data to be passed to user space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The incorrect length leads to an out-of-bounds read when the `drm_read` function attempts to copy the event data to user space. The `drm_read` function uses the provided length to determine how much data to copy, and if the length is too large, it reads memory beyond the intended boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information leak:** The out-of-bounds read can result in the kernel leaking potentially sensitive information to user space. This leaked information could be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a fence signal event is generated in the vmwgfx driver. Specifically, this occurs in the `vmw_event_fence_action_create` function when a fence has been signaled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to trigger the fence signaling mechanism within the `vmwgfx` driver to trigger the event creation and subsequent data leak. This might involve operations related to graphics rendering or other relevant vmwgfx functionalities. They must also have access to a device that utilizes the vulnerable `vmwgfx` driver and be able to interact with the DRM subsystem to receive the leaked data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves correcting the length parameter passed to `drm_read` to use the size of the `event->event` (which is a `drm_vmw_event_fence`) rather than the size of the parent structure pointed to by `event`.
- The issue was reported by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) as ZDI-CAN-23566
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions from v3.4 and later.
- Patches have been applied to multiple stable branches of the Linux kernel.
