- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack complexity is low (AC:L). No privileges are required (PR:N). User interaction is required (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs to convince a user to interact with the application to trigger the vulnerability.
