**Verification:**

The document lists CVE-2018-2926 within the "Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite Risk Matrix" section, confirming its relevance.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Solaris
*   **Component:** NVIDIA-GFX Kernel driver
*   **Protocol:** ISCSI
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth.:** No
*   **CVSS v3.0:**
    *   Base Score: 7.6
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: None
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: Low
