Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8046

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads. This allows the injection of malicious code within SVG files that gets executed by the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server within the SVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts whenever a user accesses the compromised SVG file. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive data
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Upload:** The attack vector is through the upload of a malicious SVG file. The plugin's failure to sanitize the SVG file contents before storing it on the server makes this possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least 'Author' level access to the WordPress site. This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with sufficient privileges to upload images, including SVG files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Logo Showcase Ultimate â€“ Logo Carousel, Logo Slider & Logo Grid" plugin up to and including version 1.4.1.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `lcg_adl_main.php` file.
- The plugin developer has removed the support for SVG files in version 1.4.2 to address the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability was publicly disclosed on August 26, 2024, and the patched version 1.4.2 was released on the same day.
