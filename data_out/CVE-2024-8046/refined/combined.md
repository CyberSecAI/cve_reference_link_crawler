Nice plugin, easy to use but it conflicts with the Classic Editor plugin in the dashboard, the sidebar area overflows from the screen in the add page, add post, etc… I Hope the author fixes it in the earliest update.

### Description

The Logo Showcase Ultimate – Logo Carousel, Logo Slider & Logo Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
