- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LDAP Agent Update service used an unquoted path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution could be achieved by placing an arbitrary executable into a portion of the unquoted path. The malicious executable would be run the next time the agent starts.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to place a malicious executable within the unquoted path
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs sufficiently high privileges, normally an administrator, to place an arbitrary executable into a portion of the path.
