- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to sensitive information (remote controller admin credentials) being logged in tech support files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to a tech support file can view remote controller admin credentials in clear text.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs access to a tech support file generated from a vulnerable Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain a tech support file from a vulnerable system. This is usually achieved through social engineering or unauthorized access to the system.
