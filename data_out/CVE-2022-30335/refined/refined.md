Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form of the Bonanza Wealth Management System (BWM) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the "User Name" field of the login form. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
- The attacker can retrieve all encrypted passwords from the Microsoft SQL Server database.
- This information disclosure could lead to privilege escalation within the system if the passwords can be decrypted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the login form of the Bonanza Wealth Management System application.
- Specifically, the "User Name" text box is the vulnerable entry point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login form of the application, which means they have to be able to reach the application's login page or a system where it is displayed.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a SQL injection payload. The provided example of `a' OR 'g'='g--` shows this, and they specifically must copy-paste it, as spacebar input is not allowed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable version is specifically Bonanza Wealth Management System (BWM) 7.3.2.
- The attack can be performed remotely.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided that allows the retrieval of encrypted passwords.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Pornsook Kornkitichai.
- The vendor is Wealth Management System Limited.
