The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32037.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific aggregation request using the `$sample` operator directly to a shard. This bypasses the usual routing through `mongos` and can lead to an invariant failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted aggregation request directly to a shard using the `$sample` operator.
- The system does not properly handle this type of request directly on shards, leading to the invariant failure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the server exit caused by the triggered invariant.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is sending a specific aggregation request using the `$sample` operator directly to a shard, bypassing the intended routing through `mongos`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authorized user.
- The attacker needs to know the addresses of the shards and have the privileges to log in to the shards in an authentication-enabled environment.
