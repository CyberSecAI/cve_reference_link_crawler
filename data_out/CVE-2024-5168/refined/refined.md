- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Prodys Quantum Audio codec web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to bypass login and execute arbitrary API requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Full compromise of the device through arbitrary API requests, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, where an unauthenticated user can send malicious requests to the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
