# SQL Injection Vulnerability in FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 135 (and earlier)

### FI-2024-008 - SQL Injection Vulnerability in FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 135 (and earlier)

Severity

Critical

Published Date

25-Jun-2024

Updated Date

25-Jun-2024

Vulnerabilities

CVE-2024-5276

##### Notes

Description

---

A SQL Injection vulnerability in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow allows an attacker to modify application data.  Likely impacts include creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of data in the application database. Data exfiltration via SQL injection is not possible using this vulnerability. Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise an authenticated user is required. This issue affects all versions of FileCatalyst Workflow from 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.

### Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection Vulnerability

Severity

Critical

CVE

CVE-2024-5276

CWE

CWE-20 and CWE-89:Improper Input Validation and Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

Discovery Date

18-Jun-2024

CSSv3.1

9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected Products

FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 135 (and earlier)

##### Vulnerability Notes

Description

---

CAPEC-66 SQL Injection

This attack exploits target software that constructs SQL statements based on user input. An attacker crafts input strings so that when the target software constructs SQL statements based on the input, the resulting SQL statement performs actions other than those the application intended. SQL Injection results from failure of the application to appropriately validate input.

Remediation: Vendor Fix

---

FileCatalyst Workflow users upgrade to 5.1.6 build 139 (or later)

# Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow Unauthenticated SQLi

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow v5.1.6 build 135 and earlier.

A user-supplied jobID is used to form the WHERE clause in an SQL query:

```
// class unlimited.core.l.p
 public xc findJob(String jobID) {
   if (jobID == null)
     return null;
   if (jobID.equals(""))
     return null;
   b query = new b("*", xc.ps, xc.yr + "='" + jobID + "'");
   xc pjret = null;
   ResultSet rs = null;
   Connection conn = this.hb.getDatabaseSettings().we().b();
   try {
     rs = this.mb.b((e)query, conn);
[...]
// class unlimited.core.l.c.b.b.b constructor
 public b(String columns, String from, String where) {
   this(columns, from, where, -1);
 }
[...]
```

An anonymous remote attacker can perform SQLi via the JOBID parameter in various URL endpoints of the workflow web application.

**Proof of Concept**

```
