A SQL Injection vulnerability in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow allows an attacker to modify application data.  Likely impacts include creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of data in the application database.

Affected Products

FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 135 (and earlier)

##### Vulnerability Notes

Description

---

CAPEC-66 SQL Injection

This attack exploits target software that constructs SQL statements based on user input. An attacker crafts input strings so that when the target software constructs SQL statements based on the input, the resulting SQL statement performs actions other than those the application intended. SQL Injection results from failure of the application to appropriately validate input.

Remediation: Vendor Fix
