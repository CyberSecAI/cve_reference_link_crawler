- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an unauthenticated path traversal issue in the Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE)/IBM Content Navigator (ICN) in FileNet Content Manager (FNCM). This is due to an outdated version of Apache PDFBox.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated path traversal. The software uses an outdated version of Apache PDFBox (prior to v2.0.24).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform path traversal attacks. The specific impact isn't detailed, but path traversal can lead to unauthorized access to files and directories.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability via network requests to the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need network access to the affected server.
