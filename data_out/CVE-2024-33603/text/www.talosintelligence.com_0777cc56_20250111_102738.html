# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1985

## LevelOne WBR-6012 Web Application information disclosure vulnerability

##### October 30, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-33603

##### SUMMARY

The LevelOne WBR-6012 router has an information disclosure vulnerability in its web application, which allows unauthenticated users to access a verbose system log page and obtain sensitive data, such as memory addresses and IP addresses for login attempts. This flaw could lead to session hijacking due to the device’s reliance on IP address for authentication.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6

##### PRODUCT URLS

WBR-6012 - <https://us.level1.com/products/wbr-6012>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.3 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-200 - Information Exposure

##### DETAILS

The WBR-6012 is a wireless SOHO router. It is a low-cost device which functions as an internet gateway for homes and small offices while aiming to be easy to configure and operate. In addition to providing a WiFi access point, the device serves as a 4-port wired router and implements a variety of common SOHO router capabilities such as port forwarding, quality-of-service, web-based administration, a DHCP server, a basic DMZ, and UPnP capabilities.

The web page located at syslog2.htm (verbose system log) exposes sensitive information such as memory addresses, debug messages, settings, IP addresses for login attempts, and more, to unauthenticated users.

This allows an unauthenticated user to discover the IP address of administrator users, potentially exposing them to session hijacking via Web Application Reliance on IP Address for Authentication (TALOS-2024-1996).
