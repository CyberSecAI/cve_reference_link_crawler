The LevelOne WBR-6012 router has an information disclosure vulnerability in its web application, which allows unauthenticated users to access a verbose system log page and obtain sensitive data, such as memory addresses and IP addresses for login attempts. This flaw could lead to session hijacking due to the device's reliance on IP address for authentication.
