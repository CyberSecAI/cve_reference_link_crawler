- Potential for account hijacking, session theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must first log into the application as an administrator.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload via the "content" field while editing the zookeeper account.
- The XSS payload gets stored in the database.
- When a victim views the compromised page with the vulnerable data, the injected script is executed in the victim's browser.
