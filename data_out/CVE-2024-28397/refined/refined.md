Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28397:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the implementation of global variables within the `js2py` library. It allows an attacker to obtain a reference to a Python object within the `js2py` environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Escape:** The primary weakness is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the confines of the `js2py` JavaScript sandbox.
- **Bypass `pyimport` Restriction:** The vulnerability bypasses the intended restriction imposed by `js2py.disable_pyimport()`, which is designed to prevent JavaScript code from interacting with the underlying Python environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system where the vulnerable `js2py` code is running. This allows the attacker to potentially take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JavaScript:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious JavaScript code and delivering it to the victim. This code can be:
    - Hosted on a website, which the victim might visit.
    - Sent via HTTP API to be parsed by the victim's application using `js2py`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Deliver Malicious JavaScript:** The attacker needs the capability to deliver the malicious JavaScript to a system using `js2py`. This can be done through various means, such as:
    -  Hosting the script on a website.
    -  Sending it via a network request to an API which uses `js2py`
- **Target Needs to be Running Vulnerable `js2py` Version:** The target system must be using a vulnerable version of `js2py` (<=0.74) running under Python 3 (specifically below 3.12).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub repository includes a Proof of Concept (`poc.py`) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be triggered to execute shell commands.
-  A `fix.py` script is also available, which patches the vulnerable code. A `patch.txt` file is provided to manually fix the source code.
- The vulnerability was found in February and a PR was submitted to the official repo, but was not addressed leading the researcher to release a PoC.
- The provided text lists the following projects as affected: `pyload/pyload`, `VeNoMouS/cloudscraper`, and `dipu-bd/lightnovel-crawler`.
