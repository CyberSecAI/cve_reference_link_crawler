- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Table of Contents plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the "ez-toc-settings[heading_text_tag]" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code via plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could lead to various actions, including but not limited to: session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing administrative actions within the context of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits a settings field within the plugin's admin panel accessible to privileged users (editors or admins).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, like an editor or administrator, to access the plugin's settings and modify them. The attack is performed via the plugin's settings page.
