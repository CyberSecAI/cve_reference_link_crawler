- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the unencrypted transmission of administrator credentials within the `U_EP` protobuf structure when a privileged request is sent to the OAS Engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319): The `U_EP` protobuf, containing encrypted user credentials, is transmitted unencrypted over the network.
    - Authentication bypass: An attacker can capture a valid `U_EP` and reuse it to perform privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By capturing and replaying a valid `U_EP`, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the OAS Engine. This can lead to the creation of new user accounts, modification of the configuration, and access to the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network traffic sniffing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between a legitimate client and the OAS Engine to sniff network traffic and capture a valid `U_EP`.
