The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2022-36354.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an off-by-one error in the `decode_rle_span` function when processing run-length encoded data within the RLA image format. Specifically, the code increments the index `e` before accessing the `encoded` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the RLA format parser.
- Off-by-one error in the `decode_rle_span` function when handling RLE encoded byte spans.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information leak via reading heap metadata.
- Potential for use as a component in a more complex exploit.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a malformed RLA file to a vulnerable application using the OpenImageIO library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted RLA file to a vulnerable application using OpenImageIO.
- No special privileges are required.
