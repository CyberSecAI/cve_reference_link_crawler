Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `order.php` file of the "Online Food Ordering System Project V1.0".
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient user input validation of the `custom` parameter. This parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization or validation of the `custom` parameter.
- Direct use of unsanitized user input in SQL queries: This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- Time-Based Blind SQL Injection: The specific type of SQL injection is time-based blind, which means the attacker can infer information about the database by observing the time it takes for the query to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authorization.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information stored in the database.
- Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- Comprehensive system control: In severe cases, attackers might gain control over the system.
- Service interruption: The vulnerability could lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `purchase.php`.
- `custom` parameter: The malicious SQL code is injected through the `custom` parameter within the POST request.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any login or authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to know that the `custom` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Network access to the vulnerable system: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- No special privileges: The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authorization on the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security review of the system.
- A proof of concept (POC) is provided, which includes a sample HTTP request demonstrating the SQL injection.
- The content provides screenshots from `sqlmap` tool demonstrating the successful exploitation.
- The suggested mitigations include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
