Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-47757.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nilfs_btree_check_delete()` function in the nilfs2 filesystem driver attempts to retrieve the maximum key of a b-tree node. If the root node has no children (entries), the code attempts to access memory outside the block buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the b-tree root node, read from a device, is configured without any entries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `nilfs_btree_check_delete()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malformed nilfs2 filesystem image with a root b-tree node having zero children can trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a system crash or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A crafted nilfs2 filesystem image (or a device with such a configuration on it) loaded by the kernel, which has a root node of the b-tree with no child entries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to load a crafted nilfs2 file system image. This implies either local access or remote access with ability to mount file systems.

**Additional Notes**
The fix addresses the issue by adding a check for the zero-child case and returning 0 if it is encountered. This prevents the out-of-bounds read from occurring.
This vulnerability is unlikely to occur naturally because a b-tree mapping with no child nodes is never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.
