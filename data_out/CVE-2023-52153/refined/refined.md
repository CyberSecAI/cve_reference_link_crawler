    "CVE-2023-52153": {
      "root_cause": "Unsafe concatenation in SQL queries within the session handling component (/pmb/opac_css/includes/sessions.inc.php). The application uses addslashes() to escape some entries, but not all, leading to a time-based SQL injection.",

      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive data. This can also allow extraction of other users' session identifiers, including those with administrative privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'PmbOpac-LOGIN' session cookie.",
          "Network access to the vulnerable web application"
