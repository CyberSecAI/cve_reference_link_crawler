- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Reservation.Studio widget plugin version 1.0.11 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
