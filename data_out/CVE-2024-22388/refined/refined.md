Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper authorization in the communication channel for HID Global encoders allows exposure of sensitive data when programming reader configuration cards. This data includes credential and device administration keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-1188):** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access controls during the programming of reader configuration cards. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can read credential and device administration keys from reader configuration cards.
*   **Malicious Card Creation:** The extracted keys can be used to create malicious configuration cards or credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or system compromise.
*   **Credential Cloning:** While modern technologies are not easily cloned using this data, systems supporting legacy technologies may be vulnerable to credential cloning by inserting the information into a legacy credential.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires physical proximity to the reader configuration cards and the encoder or reader to extract information.
*   **Communication Channel Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the communication channel used for programming the cards.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target HID encoders/readers and the reader configuration cards.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the communication protocols used for programming reader configuration cards.
* **Low privilege:** No special privileges are needed according to the CVSS vector "PR:N".

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.9 with the vector string: AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   HID Global has released mitigations for this vulnerability, including firmware updates for iCLASS SE Readers and "Shield Cards" for OMNIKEY readers.
*   CISA recommends minimizing network exposure of control systems, using firewalls, and implementing secure remote access methods.
