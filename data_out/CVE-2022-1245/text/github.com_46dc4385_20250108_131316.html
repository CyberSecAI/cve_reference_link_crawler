# Privilege escalation vulnerability on Token Exchange feature

Moderate

[abstractj](/abstractj)
published
GHSA-75p6-52g3-rqc8
Apr 25, 2022

## Package

maven

org.keycloak.services
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 18.0.0

## Patched versions

18.0.0

## Description

A privilege escalation flaw was found in the token exchange feature of keycloak. Missing authorization allows a client application holding a valid access token to exchange tokens for any target client by passing the client\_id of the target. This could allow a client to gain unauthorized access to additional services.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-1245

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)
