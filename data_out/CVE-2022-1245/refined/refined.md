- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization in the token exchange feature of Keycloak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A client application with a valid access token can exchange it for tokens of any target client by specifying the target's `client_id`. This bypasses the intended authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker (a client application) could gain unauthorized access to additional services by obtaining tokens for other clients without proper authorization. This results in privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the token exchange functionality within Keycloak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a client application holding a valid access token. They don't need any special privileges or network position beyond that.
