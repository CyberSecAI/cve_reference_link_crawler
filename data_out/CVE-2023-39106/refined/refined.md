Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `nacos-spring-context` component uses SnakeYaml's `Constructor()` class for deserializing YAML content. This class, by default, does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted Deserialization:** The lack of type restrictions during YAML deserialization allows an attacker to inject malicious classes into the deserialization process.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting malicious YAML content with specially crafted classes, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server where the `nacos-spring-context` component is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious YAML Configuration:** An attacker can inject malicious YAML content through the Nacos configuration server. When the vulnerable `nacos-spring-context` loads this configuration, the malicious code is deserialized and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Nacos Configuration Server:** An attacker needs to have access to the Nacos configuration server to inject the malicious YAML content. This could involve compromised credentials or exploitation of another vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable dependency:** Attacker should be aware that the application is using `nacos-spring-context` and the fact that it is vulnerable to YAML deserialization.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue was reported in `nacos-spring-context` version `1.1.1`
- The specific payload provided in the report uses `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and `java.net.URLClassLoader` to achieve RCE.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `1.1.2` of the library, by restricting the types that can be deserialized or by adding `YAML_ALLOW_OBJECT`.
