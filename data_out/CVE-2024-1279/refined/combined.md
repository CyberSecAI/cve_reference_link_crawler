## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Paid Memberships Pro < 2.12.9 - Contributor+ Arbitrary User Custom Field Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not prevent user with at least the contributor role from leaking other users' sensitive metadata.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor,
- Add shortcode to any post and specify/guess any user ID and meta key and save
- Preview the post and see custom field value outputs from any user
Example shortcode: `[pmpro\_member user\_id="ANY\_USER\_ID" field="ANY\_META\_KEY"]`
