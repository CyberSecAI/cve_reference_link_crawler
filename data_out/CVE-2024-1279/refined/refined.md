- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Paid Memberships Pro plugin does not properly restrict access to user metadata via the `pmpro_member` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control. Contributor-level users can use the `pmpro_member` shortcode to access and disclose arbitrary user custom field values, including sensitive metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user metadata.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a post with a `pmpro_member` shortcode that specifies a user ID and a meta key, an attacker (with at least contributor privileges) can leak any user's metadata.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges on the WordPress site.
