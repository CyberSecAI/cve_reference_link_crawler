| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2219266#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-07-03 06:57:40 UTC  ``` The 9p protocol does not specifically define how server shall behave when client tries to open a special file, however from security POV it does make sense for 9p server to prohibit opening any special file on host side in general. A sane Linux 9p client for instance would never attempt to open a special file on host side, it would always handle those exclusively on its guest side. A malicious client however could potentially escape from the exported 9p tree by creating and opening a device file on host side.  <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/f6b0de53fb87ddefed348a39284c8e2f28dc4eda>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2219266#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-07-03 08:03:12 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2219306](show_bug.cgi?id=2219306 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-2861 qemu: 9pfs: improper access control on special files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2219266#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-07-04 07:45:59 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
