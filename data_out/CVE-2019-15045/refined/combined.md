Vendor description:
-------------------
"ServiceDesk Plus is a game changer in turning IT teams from daily
fire-fighting to delivering awesome customer service. It provides great
visibility and central control in dealing with IT issues to ensure that
businesses suffer no downtime. For 10 years and running, it has been
delivering smiles to millions of IT folks, end users, and stakeholders
alike."

Source: <https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version and it should be installed immediately.
Furthermore, a thorough security analysis is highly recommended as only a short
spot check has been performed and further critical issues are to be expected.
A workaround exists for mitigating vulnerability 1b (user enumeration).

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated sensitive information leakage
a) Unauthenticated download of internal support ticket information (CVE-2019-15046)
The software offers functionality (fosagent) that an unauthenticated attacker can
exploit in order to gain information of internal "events". In our test it was
possible to access sensitive internal information (tickets) written by users of
this application in exchange with the support team. Depending on the contents of
the tickets, sensitive data might leak through this functionality. It is likely,
that it also depends on the configuration of ServiceDesk Plus which information is
stored in those "events".

b) User Enumeration in AjaxDomainServlet (CVE-2019-15045)
It is possible to collect valid usernames by interacting with the
"AjaxDomainServlet" function of the application without prior authentication.
This vulnerability is useful to increase the efficiency of brute force attacks.
If the username is known, it is easier to find the corresponding password.

Furthermore, the servlet leaks information, whether the user is a locally
configured or a domain user and it also leaks the internal domain names of the
requested user account.

According to the vendor, the affected feature is intended behaviour and a
workaround in order to disable it has been provided (see further below).

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated sensitive information leakage
a) Unauthenticated download of internal support ticket information (CVE-2019-15046)
The "fosagent" functionality provides a "download-file" servlet which an
unauthenticated attacker can use in order to iterate through existing internal
"events". The information that can be downloaded looks like internal ticket system
information and other data exchanged between users and the help desk support team.
It is necessary to supply the "log-pos" parameter given a number followed by a
colon character and another number to access the corresponding event index. An
attacker can just increment those numbers and access different information.

<https://$IP/fosagent/repl/download-file?log-pos=1:0>

b) User Enumeration in AjaxDomainServlet (CVE-2019-15045)
The following URL can be used to efficiently enumerate user accounts configured
within ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. No prior authentication is required for
this functionality. The "search" parameter is used for supplying the user account
name.

<https://$IP/domainServlet/AJaxDomainServlet?action=searchLocalAuthDomain&search=$USER>

If the user exists and is a local user (configured within the web application)
it will show "Not in Domain" as a result. If the user exists and is a domain
user (e.g. LDAP) it will show the corresponding internal domain name as a result.
If the page stays empty the user does not exist.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Version 10 has been tested. The vendor did not confirm whether older releases are
affected as well.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2019-07-02: Contacting vendor through ManageEngine Security Response Center
            (MESRC)
            Uploaded security advisory to bugbounty.zoho.com
2019-07-02: Vendor: acknowledged our report and will get back to us soon
2019-07-08: Asking for a status update; reponse: "we've investigated the report
            and working on the fix now"
2019-07-10: Asking about CVE numbers and requesting heads-up before release
2019-08-13: Asking for a status update
2019-08-13: Vendor: vulnerability has already been fixed and released in version
            10509
2019-08-21: Release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides an updated version which should be installed immediately.
<https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/download.html>

The vendor also provided a link to their readme about the new release:
<https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/readme.html#10509>

Workaround:
-----------
Vulnerability 1b - User Enumeration: the affected feature is intended behaviour
for usability but the vendor provided a workaround in order to disable this
feature.

The admin can disable this in:
Admin-Self-Service Portal Settings (Configuration - Allow Domain Filtering during
Login).

    is only for questions created before migration.
  - The resource manual question's image description limit is set to 5000 characters. **Note**: Any description above the mentioned limit will be removed during migration.
  - Resource manual question's option ID will be passed with its new option ID in **requestObj** in custom functions that are in the old format (V3). Since a new option ID will be passed, scripts
    containing checks or any other actions will fail due to the change in option IDs.
  - After migration, newly created resource questions should be sent inside **udf\_fields** and not under **resources->res\_<Id>** for API requests that requires backward compatibility.
  - When a **Custom Function** is executed for service requests, the context has **modifiedFields** which contains the list of fields that is modified.If a resource question is modified,
    **udf\_fields** will be mentioned (In released builds **resources** will be present).

    **Admin > Resource Questions, and Admin > Resource Sections**. Already selected product and software questions options selected in the request before downgrade will be displayed after downgrade.
    But **View Details** will be restricted.
  - When a deleted value in **Picklist** and **Radio** additional field or resource question is present in a workflow field update action, when this rule is applied to a request with
    some value for that field **In released builds**: The value remains unchanged. **After migration**: The value present will be removed.

  - The maximum precision for decimal type fields is three.
  - Question's manual option cost is now reduced to 14 digits for the integer part and value in globalconfig for decimal places.
  - Decimal field values in the workflow criteria will be displayed as saved. ( If 123.12345 is given as criteria and rule is saved, 123.12 will be returned in released builds but 123.12345 will be displayed
    after migration)

  **Note :** No change in rule applying behavior. Only the value displayed is changed.

  - For migrated builds, to get the new format JSON in **Execute scripts, $COMPLETE\_V3\_0\_JSON\_FILE** should be used instead of **$COMPLETE\_V3\_JSON\_FILE**.
  - After migration, to support new format for external API calls, **Accept:application/v3.0+json** header should be added. The same applies for API calls made inside **Custom Functions**.
  - There will be a delay in response for the API requests that require backward compatibility support.
  - When the field type of the question is modified after configuring it in **Criteria/Field Update** rules, the api key will be changed, and the data will not be visible in the client nor get executed
    in released builds. But, the data will be visible and executable in **Refer** (Post migration).
