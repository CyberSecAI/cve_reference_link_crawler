### Description

The Post Meta Data Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the pmdm\_wp\_ajax\_delete\_meta, pmdm\_wp\_delete\_user\_meta, and pmdm\_wp\_delete\_user\_meta functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user, term, and post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
