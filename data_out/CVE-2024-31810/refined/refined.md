```
Root cause of vulnerability: The TOTOLINK EX200 router firmware contains a hardcoded password for the root user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Hardcoded password in `/etc/shadow.sample` file.
- The hardcoded password "cs2012" can be used to gain root access via Telnet (port 23).

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can gain full root access to the device.
- Allows complete control of the device, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and network manipulation.

Attack vectors:
- Network access to the device via Telnet (port 23).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to access port 23 (Telnet) of the device.
- Knowledge of the hardcoded password "cs2012".
