Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40760:

**CVE-2023-40760**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the "Forgot Password" functionality of the Hotel Booking System. Specifically, the system discloses whether a provided username or email address is registered within the system.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue, specifically user enumeration. The "Forgot Password" feature should not reveal whether a user exists.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious actor can utilize this vulnerability to enumerate valid user accounts on the system. This information can be a crucial first step for other attacks, such as brute-force password attempts, phishing attacks targeted at known users, or exploiting other vulnerabilities tied to identified user accounts.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed via the "Forgot Password" form. An attacker can input potential usernames or email addresses and observe the system's response to deduce whether those credentials correspond to existing user accounts.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to interact with the "Forgot Password" functionality of the Hotel Booking System.

**Summary:**
The "Forgot Password" function in the Hotel Booking System discloses whether a user exists by revealing when a submitted username or email is recognized. This allows attackers to easily enumerate registered usernames or emails.
