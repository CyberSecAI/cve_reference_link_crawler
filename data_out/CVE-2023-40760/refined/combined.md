There are 10 different color schemes you can choose from in order to match the script's appearance with your hotel management website branding. The layout features a responsive design so that clients can load script contents across various mobile devices including Android and iOS smartphones and make bookings on the go.

![Online room booking system](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/online-booking-system.png)

Simple online room bookings

The step-by-step reservation process provides customers with a positive experience when booking hotel rooms which in turn can boost conversion rates. The 24/7 online front desk encourages clients to book rooms and make online payments on the spot.

![Multi-room booking support](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-multiple-room-booking-thumb.jpg)

Multiple room bookings

Guests can book more than one room within a single reservation. During the booking process, they will see the available rooms for the selected period and can pick one or more rooms and the number of guests.

![Reservation management system](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-reservation-mangement-thumb.jpg)

Reservation management

The integrated reservation management system enables administrators to manage booking details as well as customer details and add bookings manually. They can keep track of bookings by date and by status with the help of the real-time room availability calendar.

![Room management feature](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-room-mangement-thumb.jpg)

Room management

The room booking system allows you to create different room types, upload high-quality images, edit room descriptions, specify the maximum room occupancy, add room numbers for each room type, etc.

![ Rates and price management](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-price-management-thumb.jpg)

Room rate and price management

Price management is very easy! With our PHP booking engine, you can define prices based on the number of people sharing a room, or set a default price per night or per room. You can also set different rates for each day of the week or set custom and seasonal rates.

![Set booking limits](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-booking-limits-thumb.jpg)

Booking limits

Users with administrator access to the PHP Hotel Booking System can set minimum and maximum nights that can be booked by guests for any room type and date range. Admin users can also apply a limit based on the weekday that the booking starts on – for example, you may want to limit "Double room" bookings to be at least 2 nights long if the booking starts on a Friday during the summer season.

![Extras management](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-extras-mangement-thumb.jpg)

Extras management

With the online Hotel Booking System, you can offer additional extras and services, such as a parking space, extra bed, etc., and assign them to rooms. Thus, guests will be able to add them to their reservations in advance.

![Voucher system](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-voucher-system-thumb.jpg)

Voucher system

The built-in voucher system allows you to manage promos and discounts. You can add fixed or percentage discounts for different periods and create holiday packages or discounts in the form of a free night stay.

![Online and offline payments](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-payments-thumb.jpg)

Online and offline payments

PayPal and Authorize.net gateways are integrated with the PHP Hotel Booking System to automate and facilitate deposit and final payments. You can also enable other [online payment methods](payment-gateways.php) and adjust offline payments.

![Customize room booking form](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/customizable-hotel-booking-form.png)

Customizable booking form

Using a simple drop-down menu, you can define what information is required from users when booking a room. You can easily set the optional and mandatory fields using the hotel reservation script's Admin Panel.

![Editable booking terms](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-booking-terms-thumb.jpg)

Booking terms

Add your own booking terms and conditions and request your customers to accept them before submitting their reservations. JavaScript validation is performed on user input before sending the data to the database.

![Advanced gallery controls](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-gallery-thumb.jpg)

Advanced image settings

After uploading images into each room profile, you can crop, compress, and watermark them directly within the PHP hotel reservation script's back end. Drag and drop to reorder pictures and review their resolution and size.

![Smart language module](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-language-support-thumb.jpg)

Multi-language support

You can easily translate the room booking system into any language and also add multiple languages on the front end of your online booking website. Your visitors will be able to switch the front-end language by clicking on the corresponding flag.

![User access management](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-reservation-system-users.png)

Two user access levels

With our hotel reservation script, you can create unlimited user accounts and restrict staff access by assigning them as Editors. Editors can only manage reservations but do not have access to the options and settings in the Admin Panel.

![Notifications management module](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-email-sms-notifications-thumb.jpg)

Email and SMS notifications

Create and send out personalized email notifications to clients. Customize your email messages using a set of available tokens. SMS notifications can be enabled using an API key. Check out [our SMS packages](web-sms/) to activate them!

![Highly customizable hotel reservation system](https://cdn.phpjabbers.com/files/products/features/thumbs/hotel-system-customizations-thumb.jpg)

## Testimonials

Let our clients share their experience with our room booking system and how the script has improved their online business!

“

I have used PHPJabbers in conjunction with my web designer to write a hotel reservation script for our online bookings. I have found the various staff members who have assisted me to be professional, prompt, thorough, and accommodating. Based on my experiences of their work, I would highly recommend their skills and services to anyone in need of the work they do.

Maura Lyons

“

I have used a number of third party scripts over the years as it saves weeks of development time. The problem with third party scripts is that if you want to make changes to it, it can be hard to work out how it is set up. I can say without question this is the best supported PHP script I have used. The PHPJabbers support team team not only custom built my requirements for an incredibly cheap price, they adapted their PHP hotel booking script to work exactly as we required at no extra cost. These people really do make sure you are happy. Very pleased. Thanks again.

Marcus Cox

“

This is by far the best support I ever got from any company. Thanks for your quick reply. I now finished implementation and move to testing your hotel reservation system. So far it meets my expectations.

Today, I want to follow up the previous post ([https://medium.com/@mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e](/%40mfortinsec/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-phpjabbers-part-2-4fa5e2ccfe2e)) about some additional vulnerabilities discovered through a recent collaborative security research project. This was done through a local group called the Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective.

Our team, consisting of a diverse and talented group of researchers, has conducted an extensive security review on the PHPJabbers collection of scripts, and during our research, we came across some significant security vulnerabilities. It’s worth mentioning that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially pose serious threats to user data and the overall integrity of these products. We submitted our findings to MITRE, a globally recognized cybersecurity standards organization. Consequently, these vulnerabilities were validated and assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

* CVE-2023–40748
* CVE-2023–40749
* CVE-2023–40750
* CVE-2023–40751
* CVE-2023–40752
* CVE-2023–40753
* CVE-2023–40754
* CVE-2023–40755
* CVE-2023–40756
* CVE-2023–40757
* CVE-2023–40758
* CVE-2023–40759
* CVE-2023–40760
* CVE-2023–40761
* CVE-2023–40762
* CVE-2023–40763
* CVE-2023–40764
* CVE-2023–40765
* CVE-2023–40766
* CVE-2023–40767

Note that we are all professionals with full time jobs and other responsibilities. With the sheer amount of products in the PHP Jabbers lineup and limited time available, we weren’t able to assess every single product. There is a lot of code reuse in those applications, so it would be safe to assume most vulnerabilities are present in other products.

Members of the research group conducted some additional research in PHP Jabbers products and found vulnerabilities which aren’t addressed in this disclosure.

We informed the PHP Jabbers team through their online forms, but were completely ignored. Each of our attempts at communicating these vulnerabilities was met with silence and an almost instantaneous “closed” status to our submitted tickets.

Our intentions behind sharing this information aren’t to tarnish the vendor’s reputation or stir up panic among its user base. Instead, we aim to encourage proactive and transparent collaboration within the cybersecurity community. It’s crucial to remember that we all share the same goal — enhancing the overall security of products and fostering a safer digital world for users.

In the sections to follow, we will delve into each of the identified vulnerabilities:
