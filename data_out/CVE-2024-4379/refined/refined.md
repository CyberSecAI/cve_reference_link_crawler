Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4379

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Global Tooltip" widget of the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin. This lack of proper handling allows malicious code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-based stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user inputs adequately, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape user-provided data before rendering it on the page, leading to the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could potentially steal sensitive user data, including cookies and session information.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected scripts could be used to distribute malware to site visitors.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, XSS vulnerabilities can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Global Tooltip Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the plugin's Global Tooltip widget.
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** The attack vector is through user-supplied attributes of the tooltip, which are not properly sanitized and escaped.
- **Authenticated Attack:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor-level access to inject the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Contributor+ Access:** Attackers need at least contributor-level privileges to modify content and utilize the Global Tooltip widget.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** Attackers need a basic understanding of XSS techniques to craft effective malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including version 4.10.31.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.10.32.
- The vulnerability is DOM-based, which means the malicious script is not directly executed by the server but by the user's browser after the page has loaded.
- The provided code diff shows that the fix involved adding `esc_attr()` to sanitize the id, and not escaping the entire tooltip settings array with `wp_json_encode()` and outputting via `wp_kses_post()`
