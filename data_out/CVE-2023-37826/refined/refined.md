Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This arises due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Feldname" (field name) parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user input before displaying it within a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser.
-  Potentially Malicious Actions: Attackers can perform various actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying content within the web page.
-  Impact on Users: When someone edits or views the edit block, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Feldname" parameter, specifically when creating a form field within an edit block ("Bearbeitungsblock").
- When the created edit block is accessed, the injected malicious script is executed within the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and inject a payload into the vulnerable "Feldname" field.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position in the application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in "CASE 3 Taskmanagement V 3.3" by General Solutions Steiner GmbH.
- The affected component is the "Feldname" input field.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
