- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in IntelÂ® GPA Framework software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the paths it searches for required files, allowing an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files in those locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with the ability to place malicious files in locations where the software searches. The user interface (UI) being required suggests that some user action is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
