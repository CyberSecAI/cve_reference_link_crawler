- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiOS SSL-VPN web portal improperly handles the Host header in HTTP requests, leading to a Host Header Redirection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a Host Header Redirection issue, meaning the web portal can be tricked into redirecting users to an attacker-specified website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect users of the SSL-VPN web portal to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to send specially crafted HTTP requests with a malicious `Host` header to the SSL-VPN web portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SSL-VPN web portal. The attack is low risk since it must be combined with other attacks to have an impact.
