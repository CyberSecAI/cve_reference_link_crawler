- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the `selectDeviceListBy` method. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of LOCAL SERVICE.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network without requiring prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro application. No authentication is required.
