- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager which allows high-privileged users to access backup session logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows high-privileged users to read sensitive backup session logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges can read backup session logs, potentially revealing sensitive information about backup sessions
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack. An attacker who has gained high-privileged access to the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager web interface can read backup session logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high-privileged access to the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager web interface.
