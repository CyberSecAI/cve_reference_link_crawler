Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `get_calendar_materials` function within the Tutor LMS Pro plugin.
- Additionally, the `year` parameter within this function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient escaping and lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `get_calendar_materials` function lacks proper capability checks, allowing unauthorized users to access it.
- **SQL Injection:** The `year` parameter in the function is vulnerable to SQL injection due to inadequate sanitization of user input and lack of proper preparation in the SQL query, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access of Data:** Attackers can access sensitive data by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Modification of Data:**  Attackers can modify data through SQL injection.
- **Loss of Data:** Attackers could potentially cause data loss by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `get_calendar_materials` function.
- The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `year` parameter of the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs at least subscriber-level permissions, which are the lowest level of authenticated permissions and readily available on most sites.
- The attacker needs to send crafted requests to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the `year` parameter in a request to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Tutor LMS Pro versions 2.7.0 and earlier.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.7.1.
- The CVSS score is 8.8 (High).
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 15, 2024.
