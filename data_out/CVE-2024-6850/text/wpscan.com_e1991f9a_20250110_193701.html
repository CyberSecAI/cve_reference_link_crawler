## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Carousel Slider < 2.2.14 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Add a new carousel and do the following:
1. Add a Hero Carousel
2. Click the Add Slide button
3. Switch to Slide Style
4. Insert `7777"onmouseover='alert(123)'` in the Spacing/Gutter and Description of Spacing/Gutter fields. Be sure to select Content Animation "Fade in Down"
5. Add the shortcode to a post or page and see the XSS when you mouseover the slider
