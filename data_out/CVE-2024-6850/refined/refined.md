- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows high-privilege users, such as editors, to perform XSS attacks, even when `unfiltered_html` is disallowed. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who view the affected page or post.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a new carousel, adding a Hero Carousel, adding a slide, switching to slide style, and inserting malicious code in the Spacing/Gutter and Description of Spacing/Gutter fields. The shortcode for the carousel can then be placed on a post or page which will trigger the XSS when a user mouses over the slider.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-privilege user access, such as an editor role, to modify the plugin settings and create new carousels.
