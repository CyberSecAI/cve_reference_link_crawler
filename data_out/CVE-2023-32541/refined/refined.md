- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the handling of "footerr" elements within Hancom Office 2020 HWord. The vulnerability occurs because an object is deallocated, but a pointer to it is still used later.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416). The vulnerability arises from incorrect memory management of the `footerr` object, where the object is freed but a pointer to this freed memory is still used, which results in the software attempting to perform operations on the memory that has been deallocated.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability through heap grooming, which would allow an attacker to manipulate program behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted .doc file. The user must be tricked into opening the malformed file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malformed .doc file. The attacker needs to trick a user to open the malicious file.
