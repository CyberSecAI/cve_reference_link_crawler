Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions without proper escaping in the "WP Booking System" plugin. These functions are used to construct URLs, and the lack of escaping allows for the injection of malicious code into the URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into a URL and executed by the victim's browser when they visit the manipulated URL.
- **Insecure URL Construction:** The use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` without escaping allows attackers to inject arbitrary parameters into the URL, which can then be used to execute XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- This can allow attackers to perform various actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URLs:** Attackers craft malicious URLs with injected JavaScript code in the query parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick victims into clicking on the malicious URLs, typically through methods like phishing emails or malicious links on other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the target website.
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** Attackers need to be able to construct malicious URLs with injected JavaScript code.
- **Social Engineering Skill:** Attackers need to be able to trick users into clicking on the malicious links.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is present in the `view-register-website.php` file, specifically in how URLs are generated for actions like registering/deregistering a website and checking for updates.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.0.19.8.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.19.9 by ensuring proper escaping of URLs using the `admin_url()` function, which ensures the URL is properly formed for WordPress administration pages.
