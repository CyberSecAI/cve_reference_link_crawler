Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the RomethemeForm For Elementor plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a broken access control mechanism, specifically the absence of necessary checks to verify user permissions before allowing them to execute certain functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as "moderately dangerous and expected to become exploited".
*   An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions they should not be authorized to, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   The specific vector would involve triggering the vulnerable function within the plugin that lacks sufficient access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function within the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
*   The fixed version of the plugin is 1.1.3.
*  The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
