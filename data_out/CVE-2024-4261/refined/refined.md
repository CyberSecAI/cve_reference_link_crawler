Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4261

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Shortcode Execution

**Affected Software:** Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 1.9.1.

**Root Cause:** The plugin allows users to trigger an action that does not properly validate a value before passing it to the `do_shortcode` function. Specifically, the plugin takes a form ID from user input (`$_POST['data']`), sanitizes it with `absint()` but then uses it within a shortcode, which is then executed using `do_shortcode()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** While the form ID is converted to an absolute integer, the plugin does not validate if the shortcode is intended to be executed or if the user has the proper permission to execute the generated shortcode.
*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The use of `do_shortcode` with user-controlled input allows an attacker to inject and execute any registered WordPress shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary shortcodes, potentially leading to various malicious activities.
    *   This could include actions like creating new administrative users, injecting malicious scripts, modifying content, or accessing sensitive data through other plugins that register shortcodes.
    *   The impact depends on the shortcodes available on the target WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid user account with subscriber or higher privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request containing the `data` parameter to the `wp_ajax_lead_form_builderr_data` AJAX action with a manipulated form id in the `data` parameter.
*   The attacker does not need any special network access or configuration, other than the ability to reach the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `lead_form_builder` function within the `Lead_Form_Builder_Blocks` class (file `block/app.php`).
*   The vulnerable code block is:
    ```php
      $formid = isset( $postData['data'] ) ? absint( $postData['data'] ) : 0;
      $rander_form = do_shortcode( '[lead-form form-id=' . esc_attr($formid) . ']' );
    ```
*   The `lead_form_builder` function is called via an AJAX action `wp_ajax_lead_form_builderr_data`.
*   The `$_POST['security']` is checked against a nonce, and the user must have `manage_options` and `edit_posts` capabilities to reach the vulnerable code, but the code doesn't validate if the `formid` is associated with a valid form or if the generated shortcode is intended to be executed.
*   The `formid` is sanitized using `absint()` before being used in the shortcode attribute, preventing any injection via that vector, however, the execution of the shortcode itself is the issue, and allows for arbitrary shortcode execution if a valid form ID is provided.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.9.2 of the plugin.
*   The provided code snippet includes the nonce verification, which prevents CSRF but not the shortcode execution.
