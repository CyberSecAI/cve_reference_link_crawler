Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1120:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-1120, describing a missing authorization vulnerability in the "NextMove Lite – Thank You Page for WooCommerce" and "Finale Lite – Sales Countdown Timer & Discount for WooCommerce" plugins.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **System Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to download system information which can be used to aid in further attacks. The specific system information disclosed includes plugin settings, free shipping methods, and free shipping coupons.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack vector is through direct access to the vulnerable `download_tools_settings()` function without any authentication or capability verification. This suggests the function is accessible through a direct HTTP request, likely via an AJAX action or similar mechanism.
