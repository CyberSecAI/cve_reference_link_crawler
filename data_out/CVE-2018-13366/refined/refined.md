Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Fortigate PPTP service reveals the device's serial number in the hostname field of the PPTP connection control setup packets. The hostname defaults to the device's serial number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Information Disclosure: The serial number of the FortiGate device is exposed via the PPTP protocol's control packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gather information about the specific FortiGate device being used, including its serial number. While the impact is rated as "Information Disclosure", this data could potentially be leveraged in future, more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. A remote attacker can passively observe or actively intercept PPTP connection setup packets.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or monitor PPTP traffic to the affected FortiGate device. This can be within the same network or through a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to FortiOS version 6.0.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Mark Oakton at Infosec Partners.
- A fix is available in FortiOS 6.0.2 and later versions.
- The CVSSv3 score is 5.2, indicating a medium severity. The CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:X
