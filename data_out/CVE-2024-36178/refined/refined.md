*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*  **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Attack Vector:**

*   **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be performed over a network.
*   **AC:L (Low):** The attack requires low complexity to execute.
*   **PR:L (Low):** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** The attack requires some form of user interaction to be successful (e.g., clicking a link).

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Weaknesses:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are later executed in the context of other users.

**Impact:**

*   Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution. This could allow an attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs low privileges on the AEM platform to inject malicious script.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious content.

**Affected Product:**
*   Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
    * AEM Cloud Service (CS)
    * 6.5.20 and earlier versions

**Solution:**
*   Update to AEM Cloud Service Release 2024.5 or AEM 6.5.21

**Additional Notes:**
*   This bulletin lists a large number of stored XSS vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager.
*   The bulletin also lists a few additional vulnerabilities, such as an Improper Access Control vulnerability (CVE-2024-26029), Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-26126, CVE-2024-26127, CVE-2024-36226, CVE-2024-41839, CVE-2024-41849), and a Spring Framework open redirect vulnerability (CVE-2024-22243).
