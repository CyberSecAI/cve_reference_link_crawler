  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `do_ea` function within the disassembler component when processing a crafted input file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption when the disassembler attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted binary file as input to the `ndisasm` disassembler.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted binary file as input to the `ndisasm` utility."
