{
  "CVE-2022-30556": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from how Apache HTTP Server handles lengths returned by `r:wsread()` within the `mod_lua` module when using websockets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect length calculation",
       "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially trigger the server to return lengths that exceed allocated buffer space, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a malicious request that involves the use of websockets and triggers the r:wsread() function of mod_lua.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the server and initiate websocket connections."
  }
