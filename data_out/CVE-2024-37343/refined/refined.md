Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the administrative console of Absolute Secure Access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is that the Secure Access administrative console does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The console fails to validate or sanitize a limited-length script submitted by an attacker, allowing the script to be stored.
*   **Non-Default Configuration Requirement:** The exploit is contingent upon an administrator using a non-default console configuration which allows the script to be displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Integrity Impact:** An attacker can potentially alter the functionality or appearance of the administrative console to perform malicious actions, or manipulate the configuration of the system, including data manipulation.
*   **No Loss of Confidentiality:** The vulnerability is not described as providing any means to extract confidential information directly.
*    **No Impact on System Availability:** The vulnerability is not described as a means to cause a denial of service or system crash.
*   **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability scope is unchanged meaning that exploitation is limited to the context of the userâ€™s session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Based:**  The attacker sends the malicious payload through the network via a Secure Access tunnel.
*  **Requires User Interaction:** The administrator must interact with the malicious script for the XSS to be triggered.
*   **Limited Payload Length:** The attacker is limited to a certain length of script they can inject.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Tunnel Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid tunnel credentials to access the Secure Access administrative console.
*   **Low Privilege:** The vulnerability is described as requiring a low privilege attacker.
*   **Knowledge of Non-Default Configuration:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the non-default console configuration that allows the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of Absolute Secure Access prior to 13.06.
*   The CVSS 3.1 score is 4.8 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
