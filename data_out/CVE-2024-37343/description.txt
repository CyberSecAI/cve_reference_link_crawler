There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Secure
Access administrative console of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.06.
Attackers with valid tunnel credentials can pass a limited-length script to the
administrative console which is then temporarily stored where an administrator
using a non-default configuration could click on it while the attacker has a
valid tunnel session with the server. The scope is unchanged, there is no loss
of confidentiality. Impact to system availability is none, impact to system
integrity is high.
