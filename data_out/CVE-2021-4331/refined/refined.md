Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4331:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** within the "The Plus Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's registration form feature allows users to select a default role for new registrants. This functionality, including the role selection field, is exposed to lower-level users like contributors who should not have the ability to modify such settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core issue is the ability for a user with low-level permissions (Contributor+) to modify the default user role for registration, potentially setting it to "Administrator."
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly check user capabilities before allowing access to the role selection setting within the Elementor page builder, which is part of the registration form functionality. This allows unauthorized modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Site Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a low-level user (Contributor+) can create a new user with administrative privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Elementor Page Builder:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Elementor page builder, where the registration form feature is available.
*  **Plugin Registration Form:** The registration form feature of the plugin is where the vulnerable role selection field is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role.
*   **Access to Elementor:** The attacker must have access to the Elementor page builder functionality.
*   **No Interaction Needed:** The attacker does not need to interact with or gain the approval of a site administrator after creating the new admin user (if the attacker has author or higher permissions). If a lower level user like a contributor is exploiting the vulnerability they will need to create the admin user and get the site admin to approve their work in order to have the registration with admin role go live.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the free and pro versions of "The Plus Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on April 14, 2021, and patched in subsequent releases.
*   The Wordfence article notes that a contributor can not publish posts, only author+ users can elevate privileges without interaction via a site administrator
*   The vulnerable versions are:
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor PRO <= 4.1.9
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor <= 2.0.6
