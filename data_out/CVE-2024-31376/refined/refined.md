- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Dashboard To-Do List Plugin (versions <= 1.3.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated. This could result in unauthorized modifications or actions within the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious request, and then tricking an authenticated user to trigger it. This request would then force the user to perform unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
