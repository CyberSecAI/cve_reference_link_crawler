{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper error handling when reading analyzer mapping rules from a file. Specifically, when a user specifies a local file containing text analysis rules, certain crafted queries can cause the system to return the first line of the file, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient validation of user-provided file paths for text analysis rules.",
    "Lack of proper error handling when parsing these rules.",
    "Potential for unauthorized file access through text analyzer configuration.",
        "The vulnerability exists in how the application reads and processes mapping rules for text analyzers. Specifically, it doesn't properly handle errors or validate the content when a user specifies a file containing these rules, allowing for partial file reads when crafted requests are sent"

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read the first line of arbitrary text files that the OpenSearch process has read permissions to. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files or other confidential data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted queries via the REST API that reference a local file in the analyzer configuration, leading to partial file reads.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the OpenSearch REST API and have low-level privileges. They must also be able to craft specific queries to trigger the vulnerability and must have knowledge of the location and file names that are allowed by the Java Security Manager policy."
