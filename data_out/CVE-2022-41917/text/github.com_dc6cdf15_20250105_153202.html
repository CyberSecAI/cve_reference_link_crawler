# Incorrect Error Handling Allowed Partial File Reads Over REST API

Moderate

[CEHENKLE](/CEHENKLE)
published
GHSA-w3rx-m34v-wrqx
Nov 15, 2022

## Package

OpenSearch

## Affected versions

<1.3.7; <2.4.0

## Patched versions

>=1.3.7; >=2.4.0

## Description

Affected versions

1.0.0-1.3.6 and 2.0.0-2.3.0

Patched versions

OpenSearch 2.4.0 and 1.3.7

Impact

OpenSearch allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers to process data for text analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature allows certain specially crafted queries to return a response containing the first line of text from arbitrary files. The list of potentially impacted files is limited to text files with read permissions allowed in the Java Security Manager policy configuration.

Patches

OpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
