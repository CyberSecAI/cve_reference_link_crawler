- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow in the `decodePwd` function due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the user-supplied `adslPwd` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The `decodePwd` function copies the `adslPwd` parameter into a local buffer without validating its size.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unintended behaviors by overwriting the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/WanParameterSetting` with `wanType=2`, `connect=1`, and a large `adslPwd` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
