# Plain-text logging of user passwords when two-factor authentication is disabled

Moderate

[matthewpi](/matthewpi)
published
GHSA-c479-wq8g-57hr
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

composer

pterodactyl/panel
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.8

## Patched versions

1.11.8

## Description

### Impact

When a user disables two-factor authentication via the Panel, a `DELETE` request with their current password in a query parameter will be sent. While query parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many webservers (including ones officially documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query parameters in plain-text, storing a user's password in plain text.

If a malicious user obtains access to these logs they could *potentially* authenticate against a user's account; assuming they are able to discover the account's email address or username **separately**.

### Patches

This problem has been patched by [8be2b89](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1) on the `1.0-develop` branch and released under `v1.11.8` as a single commit on top of `v1.11.7` [75b5908](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/75b59080e2812ced677dab516222b2a3bb34e3a4)

Patch file: <https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1.patch>

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds at this time. There is not a direct vulnerability within the software as it relates to logs generated by intermediate components such as webservers or Layer 7 proxies.

Updating to `v1.11.8` or adding the linked patch manually are the only ways to avoid this problem.

### User Notice

As this vulnerability relates to historical logging of sensitive data, users who have ever disabled 2FA on a Panel (self-hosted or operated by a company) should change their passwords and consider enabling 2FA if it was left disabled. While it's unlikely that your account will be compromised by this vulnerability, it's not impossible.

Panel administrators should consider clearing any access logs that may contain sensitive data, for Panels using NGINX, the access log is located at `/var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-access.log`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
