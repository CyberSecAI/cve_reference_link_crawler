Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When a user disables two-factor authentication (2FA) on the Pterodactyl Panel, a `DELETE` request containing their current password in a query parameter was sent.
-  Webservers and proxies often log query parameters in plain text even when TLS encryption is used for the connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Password Logging:** The primary vulnerability is the logging of user passwords in plaintext within web server access logs when 2FA is disabled.
- **Use of `DELETE` Request:**  Using a `DELETE` request with the password in the query parameter was the specific mechanism triggering the logging of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Account Compromise:** If an attacker gains access to the server logs containing the plaintext passwords, they can potentially authenticate to the affected user accounts.
- **Data Breach:**  Exposure of the userâ€™s password in the server logs represents a significant data breach.
- **Limited Scope:**  Exploitation also requires the attacker to know or discover a user's email address or username separately.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Log Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining unauthorized access to web server access logs. This could be done through system compromise, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or insider threat.
- **Local Access:** The CVSS score indicates a local attack vector, suggesting the attacker needs access to the server where logs are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Server Logs:** The attacker must have the ability to read the webserver access logs.
- **Knowledge of User Credentials:** They must then identify the username/email address associated with the exposed password to be able to exploit this issue.

**Additional Details:**

- **Patch:** The vulnerability was fixed by changing the `DELETE` request to a `POST` request, sending the password in the request body rather than as a query parameter. The patch is available in commit `8be2b89` on the `1.0-develop` branch and `75b5908` on top of `v1.11.7`.
- **Mitigation:** Users are advised to change passwords if they have ever disabled 2FA on their Pterodactyl panel, and to enable 2FA.  Panel administrators are advised to clear server access logs.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score is 4.6 (Moderate), indicating a local attack vector with low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no impact on availability.
- **CWE:** The weakness is categorized as CWE-313: Missing Security Check on a Password.

In summary, the vulnerability arises from inadvertently logging user passwords in plain text due to the specific use of a `DELETE` request with parameters and how web servers process those. Exploitation requires an attacker to obtain access to these logs and to independently acquire username/email address information. The vulnerability has been fixed with the use of a POST request sending the password in the request body.
