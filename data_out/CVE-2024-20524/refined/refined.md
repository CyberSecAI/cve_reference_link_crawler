- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user input in incoming HTTP packets sent to the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected devices. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious code through crafted HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated, administrator-level remote attacker can cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device and be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
