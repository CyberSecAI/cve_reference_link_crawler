Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `wp_ajax_update_options` AJAX action in the "The Official Facebook Chat Plugin" for WordPress. This function is intended to update the plugin's options, specifically `fbmcc_pageID` and `fbmcc_locale`, which control the Facebook page linked to the chat plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Capability Check:** The AJAX action `wp_ajax_update_options` does not verify if the request is coming from an authorized administrator. This allows any authenticated user, including those with low-level privileges like subscribers, to trigger the function.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:**  While the plugin uses a nonce for CSRF protection, the nonce is easily discoverable within the source code of any `/wp-admin` dashboard page because of how the plugin registered the nonce using `admin_enqueue_scripts`. This makes it trivial for an attacker to obtain a valid nonce and bypass the `check_ajax_referer` check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Hijacking the Chat Function:** An attacker can change the plugin's settings to link their own Facebook Messenger account to the website's chat function. This allows them to intercept messages intended for the site owner.
*   **Social Engineering Attacks:** Attackers can use this hijacked chat to impersonate the site owner and attempt to socially engineer site visitors into revealing sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, personal data, credit card details).
*  **Denial of Service:** An attacker could disable the chat function by supplying nothing for the `pageid` parameter, leading to loss of availability of the chat service.
*  **Reputational Damage:** A malicious actor could connect a fake page to the target site's chat plugin, and when site visitors interact, they could be rude or offensive, damaging the site's reputation and potentially driving traffic to a competitor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a malicious AJAX request.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Requires an authenticated user account on the target WordPress site. This includes users with low-level permissions (e.g., subscribers).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to access the `/wp-admin` area of the WordPress site to retrieve the nonce, though this is typically available to all logged-in users, even subscribers.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft and send an AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint (`wp_ajax_update_options`).

**Additional Information:**
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.4 (HIGH), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.
*   The issue is resolved in version 1.6.
*  Wordfence Premium users received firewall protection on June 30, 2020 and free users on July 30, 2020.
