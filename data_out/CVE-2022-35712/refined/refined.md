- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network without requiring user interaction (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N) or have special privileges and can exploit the vulnerability over the network (AV:N) with low attack complexity (AC:L).
