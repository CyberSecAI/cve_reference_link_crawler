This vulnerability is due to a logic error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that performs hardware-based cryptography. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a Lenstra side-channel attack against the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the RSA private key.  The following conditions may be observed on an affected device:    + This vulnerability will apply to approximately 5 percent of the RSA keys on a device that is running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software; **not all RSA keys are expected to be affected** due to mathematical calculations applied to the RSA key.   + The **RSA key could be valid but have specific characteristics that make it vulnerable to the potential leak of the RSA private key.** If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic. See the [Indicators of Compromise](#ic) section for more information on the detection of this type of RSA key.   + The RSA key could be malformed and invalid. A malformed RSA key is not functional, and a TLS client connection to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that uses the malformed RSA key will result in a TLS signature failure, which means a vulnerable software release created an invalid RSA signature that failed verification. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-rsa-key-leak-Ms7UEfZz>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products, which perform hardware-based cryptographic functions, if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software:    + ASA 5506-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5506H-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5506W-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5508-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5516-X with FirePOWER Services   + Firepower 1000 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances   + Secure Firewall 3100 Additional information:    + This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software releases 9.16.1 and later and Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later; all earlier software releases are not affected. If a customer is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.15 or earlier or Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7 or earlier, the device is not considered vulnerable **as long as none of the RSA keys present on the device were generated by a vulnerable software release.**   + This vulnerability applies to RSA keys only. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys and Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) keys are not vulnerable.   + This vulnerability applies to all RSA keys that are stored in memory or flash on a vulnerable software release, which means an RSA key could become malformed or susceptible to the RSA private key leak during the following actions:   + - When generating a new RSA key on a vulnerable software release     - When a good RSA key is upgraded from an earlier, non-vulnerable software release to a vulnerable software release     - When importing the RSA key on a vulnerable software release Thus, any RSA key on a vulnerable software release, regardless of where it was originally generated, could be malformed (non-working but vulnerable to the RSA private key leak) or susceptible (valid but vulnerable to the RSA private key leak). If the RSA key was configured for use at any time, then it is possible the RSA private key has been leaked to malicious actors. Vulnerable Configurations If an RSA key is flagged by the **Cisco off-box detection script** or any of the conditions noted in the [Indicators of Compromise](#ic) section of this advisory, Cisco recommends that the RSA key be replaced and any certificates that use this RSA key pair be revoked and replaced. The following Cisco ASA and FTD Software features are known to be used with a configured RSA key; however, any flagged RSA key should be replaced on the device.  **ASA Software**  In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA Software features that are potentially vulnerable if a **malformed or susceptible RSA key** is associated with that feature's configuration. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined.       | Cisco ASA Software Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1 | ``` http server enable http    ``` |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |   | Cisco Security Manager (CSM)1 | ``` http server enable http    ``` |   | Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)2 | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |   | Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) VPN (remote access and LAN-to-LAN) using certificate-based authentication | ``` crypto ikev1 enable crypto ikev1 policy  authentication rsa-sigtunnel-group  ipsec-attributes trust-point  ``` |   | Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) VPN (remote access and LAN-to-LAN) using certificate-based authentication | ``` crypto ikev2 enable tunnel-group  ipsec-attributes ikev2 remote-authentication certificate ikev2 local-authentication certificate  ``` |   | Proxy Bypass | ``` webvpn proxy-bypass ``` |   | TLS Proxy | ``` tls-proxy  ``` |   | REST API1 | ``` rest-api image disk0:/rest-api agent ``` |   | SSH Access3 | ``` ssh    ``` |      1. ASDM, CSM, and REST API services are accessible only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   2. Clientless SSL VPN is no longer supported in Cisco ASA Software releases 9.17(1) and later.   3. SSH service is accessible only from an IP address in the configured **ssh** command range. **FTD Software**  In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD Software features that are potentially affected if a **malformed or susceptible RSA key** is associated with that feature's configuration. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined.       | Cisco FTD Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | ``` webvpn enable   ``` |   | Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)2 | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |   | IKEv1 VPN (remote access and LAN-to-LAN) using certificate-based authentication1,2 | ``` crypto ikev1 enable crypto ikev1 policy  authentication rsa-sigtunnel-group  ipsec-attributes trust-point  ``` |   | IKEv2 VPN (remote access and LAN-to-LAN) using certificate-based authentication1,2 | ``` crypto ikev2 enable tunnel-group  ipsec-attributes ikev2 remote-authentication certificate ikev2 local-authentication certificate  ``` |      1. Remote access VPN features are enabled through **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software or through **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   2. The Clientless SSL VPN feature is not supported as of Cisco FTD Software Release 7.1.0. However, for earlier Cisco FTD Software releases, it can be enabled using FlexConfig.Determine Whether the RSA Key Is Malformed or Susceptible To determine whether the RSA key is malformed or susceptible, use the Cisco off-box detection script, which detects malformed or susceptible RSA keys for which the RSA private key could have been leaked. Customers can run this script on a local machine (not on a Cisco ASA or FTD device) without the sensitive key material ever leaving their environment.  Cisco recommends using this script when a device is running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA or FTD Software and cannot be upgraded to a fixed software release immediately.  To use the script, do the following:    1. Export the RSA key(s) that need testing from a potentially affected device.   2. Run the script to identify whether any of the RSA keys are either malformed or susceptible to the RSA private key leak. For the script and associated documentation, see <https://github.com/CiscoPSIRT/CVE-2022-20866>.  **Note**: If an RSA key is not currently configured but was previously configured on a vulnerable software release, then the RSA private key could have been leaked. Cisco recommends removing the RSA key and revoking any certificates that use this RSA key pair. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco FMC Software.  Details  * **Lenstra Side-Channel Attack**  In 1996, Arjen Lenstra described an attack against Chinese remainder theorem optimization (RSA-CRT). This attack is possible if a fault happens during the computation of a cryptographic signature when using RSA-CRT optimization. An attacker could potentially recover the private key from the signature. This attack is also known as an RSA-CRT key leak. The Lenstra attack is a well-known side-channel attack. It does not attack the RSA algorithm directly but could exploit flaws in the implementation.  For additional information on the attack, see the [Memo on RSA signature generation in the presence of faults](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/164524).  The vulnerability described in this advisory could result in an RSA key for which the Lenstra side-channel attack is successful, potentially allowing the attacker to derive the RSA private key.  Indicators of Compromise  * These indicators of compromise are available on Cisco ASA or FTD Software fixed releases only. They are not available on previous software releases.  When an affected device is upgraded to a fixed software release, some or all of these indicators may be present to alert an administrator that the device has an RSA key for which the RSA private key may have been leaked. How to Detect Malformed or Susceptible RSA Keys When Upgrading to a Fixed Software Release **Critical Syslog Messages**  When an affected device is upgraded to a fixed software release, two new syslog messages will alert the administrator if malformed or potentially susceptible RSA keys are detected. These messages mean that the RSA key(s) flagged could have leaked the RSA private key. The new syslog messages are logged at the CRITICAL level and can be viewed by an administrator using the **show logging** CLI command. The **ASA** or **FTD** prefix is specific to the type of device the syslog is being displayed on. The new syslog messages will appear as follows:  **%ASA-1-717065: Keypair  is invalid due to the Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866) and will be cleared in memory. Please remove this key.**  **%FTD-1-717065: Keypair  is invalid due to the Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866) and will be cleared in memory. Please remove this key.**  Syslog messages **ASA-1-717065** and **FTD-1-717065** indicate that a malformed RSA key was detected that was vulnerable to the RSA private key leak described in this security advisory. The malformed RSA key was disabled and cannot be used. This RSA key was not functional previously and must be replaced. Any certificates using this RSA key pair must also be revoked and replaced.  **%ASA-1-717066: Keypair  is valid but may have been vulnerable to exposure in previous versions due to the Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866). Please remove this key.**  **%FTD-1-717066: Keypair  is valid but may have been vulnerable to exposure in previous versions due to the Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866). Please remove this key.**  Syslog messages **ASA-1-717066** and **FTD-1-717066** indicate that although the RSA key is not malformed, it was susceptible to the RSA private key leak described in this security advisory. It is highly recommended that this RSA key be replaced and any certificates using this RSA key pair be revoked and replaced.  **Error Counters**  When an affected device is upgraded to a fixed software release, several new error counters will indicate if a malformed or susceptible RSA key is detected. To view these counters, use the **show counters | grep PKI** CLI command. The new error counters appear as follows:  ```   asaftd# show counters | grep PKI...PKI          RSAKEY_INVAL_VULN                        1   SummaryPKI          RSAKEY_INVAL_SCRUB                       1   SummaryPKI          RSAKEY_INVAL_NOT_VULN                    1   SummaryPKI          RSAKEY_VALID_SHORT                       1   SummaryPKI          RSAKEY_ANALYSIS_ERROR                    1   SummaryPKI          RSAKEY_SCRUB_ERROR                       1   Summary   ```  The meaning of each new error counter is as follows:    + **RSAKEY\_INVAL\_VULN**: Invalid vulnerable key detected   + **RSAKEY\_INVAL\_SCRUB**: Invalid vulnerable key cleared in memory   + **RSAKEY\_INVAL\_NOT\_VULN**: Invalid key, not vulnerable   + **RSAKEY\_VALID\_SHORT**: Valid key vulnerable in previous affected versions   + **RSAKEY\_ANALYSIS\_ERROR**: An error occurred during analysis   + **RSAKEY\_SCRUB\_ERROR**: An error occurred while scrubbing a key These counters are incremented when a corresponding syslog message is logged and require the affected RSA key to be replaced and any certificates using the RSA key pair to be revoked and replaced.  **Device Boot Warnings**  After an affected device is upgraded to a fixed software release, one or more of the following console log messages may be observed during the boot sequence if a malformed or susceptible RSA key is detected:       | **CRITICAL:** | RSA key  is invalid due to the |   | --- | --- |   |  | Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866) |   |  | and has been cleared in memory. Please remove this key. |   |  |  |   | **CRITICAL:** | RSA key  may have been vulnerable to |   |  | exposure in previous versions due to the |   |  | Cisco RSA Private Key Leak Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20866). |   |  | Please remove this key. |       Each of these boot-time warnings will have a corresponding syslog message logged and requires the RSA key to be replaced and any certificates using the RSA key pair to be revoked and replaced.  **Debug Menu Commands**  After upgrading an affected Cisco ASA or FTD device to a fixed software release, use the new debug command **debug menu pki 60** to parse all RSA keys on the device. The command output will display the state of each RSA key to show whether any of them may have been compromised. The **Validity** column gives the current status of each RSA key. The value **INVALID** in this column indicates that the RSA private key may have been leaked. An example of output from the debug command is as follows:  ```   asa# debug menu pki 60Key Name                 : Validity  : Cisco RSA Malformed Key Vulnerability                          :           : (CVE-2022-20866) exposure status------------------------ : --------- : -------------------------------------        : Valid     : No exposure characteristicstest1                    : Valid     : ** Possible exposure in earlier software versionstest3                    : INVALID   : No exposure characteristicstest8                    : INVALID   : ** Key generated by affected version, cleared in memorytets2                    : ERROR     : ** Error during analysistest4                    : INVALID   : ** Has exposure characteristicstest5                    : unknown   : Key pair not analyzed    ```  **Undetectable Malformed RSA Key**  It is not possible to detect a malformed or susceptible RSA key that was used in the past and has since been removed. Some RSA keys may not have been functional due to being malformed, so during normal operations, they might have been removed and regenerated. If there is any concern that a malformed or susceptible RSA key was in use on a device in the past, ensure that any certificates using this RSA key pair have been revoked.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  **ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 9.15 and earlier1 | Not vulnerable |   | 9.16 | 9.16.3.19 |   | 9.17 | 9.17.1.13 |   | 9.18 | 9.18.2 |      1. If a Cisco ASA device was upgraded to a vulnerable release and then downgraded to a non-vulnerable release-for example, upgraded to Release 9.16.1 and then downgraded to Release 9.14.3.18-the RSA keys on the non-vulnerable release could be malformed or susceptible because they were saved on a vulnerable release. If a Cisco ASA device has been upgraded and downgraded in this manner, please ensure that the RSA keys are valid. **FTD Software**       | Cisco FTD Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 6.7.0 and earlier1 | Not vulnerable |   | 7.0.0 | 7.0.4 |   | 7.1.0 | Cisco\_FTD\_Hotfix\_P-7.1.0.2-2.sh.REL.tarCisco\_FTD\_SSP\_FP1K\_Hotfix\_P-7.1.0.2-2.sh.REL.tarCisco\_FTD\_SSP\_FP2K\_Hotfix\_P-7.1.0.2-2.sh.REL.tarCisco\_FTD\_SSP\_Hotfix\_P-7.1.0.2-2.sh.REL.tarCisco\_FTD\_SSP\_FP3K\_Hotfix\_Q-7.1.0.3-2.sh.REL.tar |   | 7.2.0 | 7.2.0.1 |      1. If a Cisco FTD device was upgraded to a vulnerable release and then downgraded to a non-vulnerable release-for example, upgraded to Release 7.0.0 and then downgraded to Release 6.4.0.15-the RSA keys on the non-vulnerable release could be malformed or susceptible because they were saved on a vulnerable release. If a Cisco FTD device has been upgraded and downgraded in this manner, please ensure that the RSA keys are valid. For instructions on upgrading a Cisco FTD device, see the [Cisco Firepower Management Center Upgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/upgrade/fpmc-upgrade-guide/getting_started.html).  **Note**: See the [Indicators of Compromise](#ic) section for more information on the detection of RSA keys that may have been compromised when upgrading to a fixed software release.  The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.  Recommendations  * As the result of this vulnerability, Cisco ASA or FTD device administrators may need to remove malformed or susceptible RSA keys and possibly revoke any certificates associated with those RSA keys. This is because it is possible the RSA private key has been leaked to a malicious actor.
