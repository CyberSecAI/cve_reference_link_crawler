# New HDF5 CVE Issues (Fixed in 1.14.4)

 May 6, 2024

Several new HDF5 CVE issues have been filed in MITRE and these should be released to the public sometime in the next few weeks. These CVE issues are similar to previous HDF5 CVEs in that they were discovered through fuzzing HDF5 files and involve segfaults or other problems when parsing malformed HDF5 files. These are typically rated as “medium” security by MITRE. They are all fixed in HDF5 1.14.4 (released April 15, 2024) and no MITRE CVE issues are unaddressed.

The MITRE CVE numbers are:

   Will this some day appear on maven central? The last version there is still 1.14.3-1.5.10.

      Hi Tilman,

      We do not upload to Maven Central ourselves. We assume it will be added there, there’s no reason for it not to be. Feel free to email help -at- hdfgroup.org for further questions or clarification.
