SSA-900277: MODEL File Parsing Vulnerability in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation before V2302.0012 and V2024.0001

| Publication Date: | 2024-06-11 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-06-11 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation contains a type confusion vulnerability that could be triggered when the application reads MODEL files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file using the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
