- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Type confusion vulnerability during the parsing of specially crafted MODEL files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast (CWE-704) leading to type confusion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to a crash of the application, and potentially arbitrary code execution on the target host system.
- **Attack vectors:** A user must be tricked into opening a malicious MODEL file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious MODEL file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable application.
