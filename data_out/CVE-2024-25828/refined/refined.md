```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the `editcategorytemplate_action` function within `lib/admin/template_admin.php`. The function allows users to delete template cache files, but it does not properly sanitize or validate the provided `module_name` parameter. This allows for directory traversal.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Arbitrary File Deletion: Due to the lack of proper input sanitization, an attacker can use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `module_name` parameter to navigate outside the intended cache directory and delete arbitrary PHP files on the server.
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability allows attackers to traverse directories through the `module_name` parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary File Deletion: Attackers can delete arbitrary PHP files within the web server's file system, potentially leading to:
    - Website malfunction: Deleting critical PHP files can cause the website to become non-functional.
    - Data loss: If important configuration or data files are deleted, it can result in data loss.
    - Complete compromise: Deleting key system files could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
- System instability: Deleting key files can lead to system instability.
Attack vectors:
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/index.php` with specific parameters.
- `module_name` parameter: The `module_name` parameter within the POST request is where the directory traversal payload is injected.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Authenticated user: The attacker must be logged in to the administrator backend of the CmsEasy application to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
