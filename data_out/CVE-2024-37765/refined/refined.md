- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `user_admin_theme` parameter in the `my_account.php` resource is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Blind SQL Injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries into the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, which could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed over HTTP by sending a POST request to the `/my_account.php` endpoint. The payload is included in the `user_admin_theme` parameter. The exploit uses a time-based attack by injecting `SLEEP()` functions to differentiate between true and false SQL query results based on the response time.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account on the target MachForm application.
