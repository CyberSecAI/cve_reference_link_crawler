Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Improper sanitization or lack of validation of user-supplied input for the `image` and `sitio` parameters in `show_image.php` and `otros_sitios.php` respectively.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient sanitization or encoding of the `Sub_Expresion` parameter within the `buscar_integrada.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **LFI:** The application directly includes or displays the contents of files specified by the user through the `image` and `sitio` parameters, without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **XSS:** The application reflects user-supplied data in the `Sub_Expresion` parameter back to the user's browser without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files, source code, or password files (e.g. `/etc/passwd` in the example).
    *   This could lead to information disclosure, server compromise, or further attacks.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
    *   This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **LFI:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in the `image` parameter in `show_image.php` or arbitrary file paths in `sitio` parameter in `otros_sitios.php` to read files outside the intended directory.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with JavaScript code in the `Sub_Expresion` parameter to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **LFI:** Attackers need to be able to make requests to the web application. No special privileges are required.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by tricking users into clicking malicious URLs or by inserting the payload in another way in the affected parameter.
