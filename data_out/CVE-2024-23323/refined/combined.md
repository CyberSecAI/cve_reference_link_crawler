# Excessive CPU usage when URI template matcher is configured using regex

Moderate

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-x278-4w4x-r7ch
Feb 9, 2024

## Package

Envoy Proxy
(Envoy)

## Affected versions

<1.29.1

## Patched versions

1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, 1.26.7

## Description

### Summary

The regex expression is compiled for every request and can result in high CPU usage and increased request latency when multiple routes are configured with such matchers.

### Impact

Denial of Service due to CPU exhaustion.

### Severity

Moderate

4.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
