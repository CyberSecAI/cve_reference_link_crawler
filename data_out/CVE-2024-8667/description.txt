The HurryTimer â€“ An Scarcity and Urgency Countdown Timer for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post publication due to a missing capability check on the activateCampaign() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to publish arbitrary posts like ones they have submitted for review, or a site administrator has in draft.
