The Tutor LMS Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'authenticate' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to gain control of an existing administrator account.
