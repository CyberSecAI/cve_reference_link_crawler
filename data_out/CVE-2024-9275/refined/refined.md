{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not sufficiently sanitize the `PROTOCOLx` parameter before using it in an include statement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary PHP file inclusion and execution, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers can use this to execute malicious PHP code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin_invt2.php` and manipulating the `PROTOCOLx` parameter to include arbitrary PHP files using path traversal (e.g., `../../config/[filename]`).",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/admin_invt2.php`) and specify the malicious path in the `PROTOCOLx` parameter."
