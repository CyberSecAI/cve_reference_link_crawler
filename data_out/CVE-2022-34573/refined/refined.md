Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control on the `mb_wifibasic.shtml` page of the Wavlink WiFi repeater's firmware. This allows unauthorized users to access the page without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of access control mechanisms on the `mb_wifibasic.shtml` page. This means that the page can be accessed by anyone, including unauthorized users, without any login or permission checks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `mb_wifibasic.shtml` page exposes sensitive Wi-Fi configuration information (e.g., SSID, password), potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized network access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to WiFi:** Attackers can gain access to the router's WiFi network by obtaining the credentials exposed on the vulnerable page.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once an attacker has gained access to the network, they can potentially launch further attacks on other devices connected to the network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable page by sending an HTTP GET request to the device's IP address at the path `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mb_wifibasic.shtml`.
*   **Network Proximity (if exposed to public network):** If the device is connected to a public network or the attacker is in the same network, they can directly exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Wavlink repeater. This could be direct access to the network or via an intermediary network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or valid user credentials to access the page.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a basic HTTP GET request to access the vulnerable page.
*   **Knowledge of the device's IP address:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the Wavlink repeater to send a request to the correct host.

**Additional notes:**
* The provided github content provides more details than a typical CVE description, including the vulnerable file path and the lack of access permissions. It also includes images showing the exposed wifi information.
* The content identifies a specific affected firmware version `RPTA2-77W.M4300.01.GD.2017Sep19`.
