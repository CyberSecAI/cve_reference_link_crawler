Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login functionality. Specifically, the `username` parameter in the `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code like `admin' or '1'='1` into the username field, an attacker can bypass the login authentication and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the application, effectively escalating privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Username parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `username` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in, as this vulnerability affects the login functionality itself.
- The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable endpoint.
