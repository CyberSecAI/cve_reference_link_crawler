PAM_ACCT_MGMT(3)            Linux-PAM Manual            PAM_ACCT_MGMT(3)

```
## NAME         [top](#top_of_page)

```

       pam_acct_mgmt - PAM account validation management

```
## SYNOPSIS         [top](#top_of_page)

```

       #include <security/pam_appl.h>

       int pam_acct_mgmt(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);

```
## DESCRIPTION         [top](#top_of_page)

```

       The pam_acct_mgmt function is used to determine if the user's
       account is valid. It checks for authentication token and account
       expiration and verifies access restrictions. It is typically
       called after the user has been authenticated.

       The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero
       or more of the following values:

       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.

       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           The PAM module service should return PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD if
           the user has a null authentication token.

```
## RETURN VALUES         [top](#top_of_page)

```

       PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED
           User account has expired.

       PAM_AUTH_ERR
           Authentication failure.

       PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD
           The user account is valid but their authentication token is
           expired. The correct response to this return-value is to
           require that the user satisfies the pam_chauthtok() function
           before obtaining service. It may not be possible for some
           applications to do this. In such cases, the user should be
           denied access until such time as they can update their
           password.

       PAM_PERM_DENIED
           Permission denied.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           The authentication token was successfully updated.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User unknown to password service.
