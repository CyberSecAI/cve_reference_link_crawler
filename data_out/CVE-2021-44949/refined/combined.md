| Currently the full name (could be a nickname) is shown along with the username. I don't think it would hurt to show only the fullname, if available, otherwise the user name. Creating a "nickname" field is interesting, but I suspect most users will leave it blank if allowed, or use their login names for it as well. … On Thu, Dec 9, 2021 at 2:12 AM Topsec\_bunney \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: We can get username on this link: <http://192.168.255.130/glfusion1.7.9/public_html/users.php?mode=profile&uid=3> [image: firefox\_fIwf2EDlUU] <<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73220685/145376552-976aae00-0893-44b7-ac14-0c1e7de9233f.png>> So, attacker can get all username .

| Incidentally, it's worth mentioning that the lockout is based on failed attempts from an IP address, not by user name. So the valid user could still log into the site. Unless they're sharing a public IP with the attacker, of course. … On Thu, Dec 9, 2021 at 9:43 AM Lee Garner \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Currently the full name (could be a nickname) is shown along with the username.

| As Lee mentioned, the lockout is temporary and in-line with standard practices in performing a temporary lock out to prevent brute force attacks. I don't see this as a vulnerability. |
