Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the issue reported, which was later deemed invalid:

**Root Cause of the (Claimed) Vulnerability:**

*   The issue revolves around the ability to retrieve usernames via the `/users.php?mode=profile&uid=` endpoint in glFusion CMS 1.7.9.
*   The reporter claims that by knowing a user's ID, one can obtain their username, making it possible for attackers to attempt login with incorrect passwords and trigger an IP-based lockout, thus denying legitimate users access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (as claimed):**

*   **Username Enumeration:** The primary issue is the public exposure of usernames. The `users.php` script allows retrieval of usernames which is considered sensitive information.
*   **IP-Based Lockout:** The system uses an IP-based lockout mechanism for failed login attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation (as claimed):**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can prevent legitimate users from logging in by repeatedly attempting to log in with the correct username but an incorrect password, thus triggering the IP-based lockout for the targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can obtain usernames by directly accessing the `/users.php?mode=profile&uid=` endpoint and cycling through User IDs.
*   **Login Form:** After obtaining the usernames, the attacker would use the standard login form to initiate failed login attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable glFusion CMS instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
*   The attacker should have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the way user IDs are assigned (e.g., incremental).

**Important Notes:**

*   The issue was marked as **invalid** by the glFusion team because the lockout mechanism is IP-based and temporary (designed to prevent brute-force attacks). Legitimate users not sharing an IP with the attacker would not be affected.
*   The suggested solutions by the reporter include adding verification codes (captchas) to the login page and displaying nicknames instead of login names.
*   The issue is based on a user's claim of a vulnerability not on a standard CVE.

**Summary:**

The content describes a user-reported issue claiming a vulnerability related to username exposure and DoS through IP-based lockout. However, the project maintainers deemed it invalid, stating the lockout was working as designed, mitigating the claimed denial-of-service risk.
