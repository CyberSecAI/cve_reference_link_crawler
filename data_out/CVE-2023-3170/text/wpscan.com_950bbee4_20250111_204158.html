## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# tagDiv Composer < 4.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin, used as a companion by the Newspaper and Newsmag themes from tagDiv, does not validate and escape some settings, which could allow users with Admin privileges to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Visit Newsmag > Plugins and install and activate "tagDiv Composer"
2. Visit Newsmag > Theme panel > Custom Code
3. Enter the following in "Custom CSS" and click "Save Settings":
</style><img src onerror=alert('XSS')><style>
4. Visit the site frontend to see the XSS.
