Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-22649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Sensitive data is being leaked into Rancher's audit logs due to insufficient redaction of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:**  The vulnerability lies in the Rancher audit logging feature, which, when enabled, logs sensitive data. The audit log includes various headers, request/response bodies, API server calls, raw agent command lines, and kubeconfig files without proper sanitization.
*   **Specific Sensitive Data:**  The leaked data includes HTTP headers (like `X-Api-Auth-Header`, `X-Api-Set-Cookie-Header`, and `X-Amz-Security-Token`), credentials in request bodies, secrets within API responses, raw agent command-line arguments containing tokens, and kubeconfig file contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, credentials, and secrets. This could allow unauthorized access to the Rancher server, downstream clusters, or cloud provider accounts, depending on the leaked secrets.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Depending on the permissions associated with the leaked credentials, an attacker could potentially move laterally within the infrastructure.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the leaked credentials belong to administrative users or service accounts with broad permissions, attackers could escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Audit Log Exposure:** The primary attack vector is through access to the Rancher audit logs. The logs could be stored locally or shipped to external log collectors.
*   **Actions Triggering Leaks:** The specific actions that trigger the leak in audit logs include creating cloud credentials, creating authentication providers, downloading kubeconfig files, and login/logout operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Audit Logs:** An attacker must gain access to the Rancher audit logs to exploit this vulnerability. The required level of access will depend on where the logs are stored (locally within the system or externally) and how the RBAC is enforced for those logs.
*   **Rancher Deployment with Audit Logging Enabled:** This vulnerability affects Rancher deployments with audit logging enabled and the `AUDIT_LEVEL` set to `1 or above`.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Severity:**  The vulnerability is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 7.8.  The severity depends on how and where the logs are stored and the permissions tied to the leaked secrets. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`, which indicates local attack vector with high confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.
*   **Affected Versions:** Rancher versions 2.6.0 through 2.6.13, 2.7.0 through 2.7.9, and 2.8.0 through 2.8.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Rancher versions 2.6.14, 2.7.10, and 2.8.2.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Disable the audit feature or decrease its level to `0`.
    *   Ensure that logs are handled appropriately and not shared without proper access controls if the audit feature is required.
    *   Rotate static secrets after patching.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).
