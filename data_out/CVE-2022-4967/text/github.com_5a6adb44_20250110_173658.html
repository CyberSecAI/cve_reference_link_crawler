libtls: Enforce client/server identity when looking for public key

```
The client already enforces that the server identity is contained in the
received certificate.  But on the server, the referenced commit changed
the lookup from the configured (or adopted if %any was configured) client
identity to the subject DN of the received client certificate.  So any
client with a trusted certificate was accepted.

Fixes: [d2fc9b0](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/d2fc9b0961c6963397aa28b42d9562d2aa944c28) ("tls-server: Mutual authentication support for TLS 1.3")
Closes [#873](https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/issues/873)
