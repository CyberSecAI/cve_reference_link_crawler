I saw this line //set navigation bar when logged in and role of admin in the header.php file in your restaurant-reservation system. Can I login as an admin and if so, what username and password do I use?

Hi, it is an interesting system but we need (all of users I think) an admin login section to manage/add/edit the reservations by ourself; point 2 – The system is not complete (like tables.php, view\_tables.php, schedule.php etc are blank…), point 3 – The “sign in” link (in Registration page) doesn’t work, the red “cancel” button near the reservation redirect to “403 forbidden page” and there is no button to edit the reservations fields, lastly (for the moment 🙂 ) if there is a way to order automatically by date the reservations. Can you do the best to solve those problems… Read more »
