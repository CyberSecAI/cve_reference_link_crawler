The provided content is related to CVE-2024-24684.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the unsafe usage of the `fscanf` function to read strings into fixed-size stack buffers within the `readOFF` function of libigl. Specifically, the `header` buffer used to store the first line of the OFF file is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow if the header line exceeds 1000 bytes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the usage of `fscanf` with `%s` format specifier without any size limit, leading to write beyond the bounds of the `header` buffer
- Insecure handling of comments in vertex and face parsing, resulting in overflows in the `comment` buffer

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A specially crafted .off file can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a malicious .off file that triggers the stack-based buffer overflow when parsed by libigl.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted .off file to an application using the vulnerable libigl library.
- No special privileges are required. The user is required to open the malformed `.off` file
