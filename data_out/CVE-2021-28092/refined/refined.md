Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) issue within the `is-svg` npm package. Specifically, the regular expression used to validate if a given string is an SVG was susceptible to excessive backtracking when processing crafted malicious inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS Vulnerability:** The core issue is a poorly constructed regular expression that can cause a denial of service when provided with specially crafted SVG-like input strings. This is due to the regex engine needing to perform exponential time to process the malicious input.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The vulnerability exists because user-provided input is not properly sanitized or validated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. The vulnerable application or server becomes unresponsive or experiences significant performance degradation due to the CPU-intensive regular expression evaluation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG Input:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted string to the `is-svg` package that resembles an SVG. This malicious input is designed to exploit the vulnerable regular expression causing excessive backtracking and CPU utilization.
- **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when `is-svg` is used on a server or an application that accepts user-input strings, especially SVG data. This could be web applications, APIs, or any service that processes external SVG data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the system using the `is-svg` package. This means the system must be processing potentially malicious SVG data coming from a source that is at least partially under attacker control.
- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can cause the DoS by sending a malicious SVG string.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The NetApp advisory states that `is-svg` versions 2.1.0 through 4.2.1 are vulnerable.
- **Patch Information:** The `is-svg` package released version 4.2.2 which includes a partial fix for the ReDoS vulnerability and version 4.3.0 which fully resolves the issue, per github release notes.
- **NetApp Products:** The NetApp advisory states that their products are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Summary**
The provided content relates to CVE-2021-28092. The vulnerability is a ReDoS in the `is-svg` package which could cause denial of service when processing crafted malicious SVG inputs.  The vulnerability exists in versions 2.1.0 through 4.2.1 and is fixed in 4.3.0. NetApp products are not affected by this vulnerability.
