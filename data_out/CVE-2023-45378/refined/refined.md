Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `ajax_slider_positions.php` script of the "PrestaBlog" module. Specifically, the `languesup` parameter obtained from `Tools::getValue('languesup')` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `languesup` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Critical Severity (CVSS 9.8):** The vulnerability allows for a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    *   Obtaining admin access.
    *   Removing data from the PrestaShop database.
    *   Exposing sensitive data like tokens to unlock admin ajax scripts.
    *   Hijacking emails by modifying SMTP settings.
    *   Complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network using a simple HTTP request.
*  **Attack complexity:** low, it can be trivially exploited via a http call

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
*   **Guest User:** The attacker can be a guest user.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the "PrestaBlog" module up to and including 4.4.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4.8 by casting the `languesup` parameter to an integer: `(int) Tools::getValue('languesup')`.
*   Older versions of the module might still be vulnerable even after updates if the vulnerable files were not automatically deleted during past upgrades.
*   The provided patch shows the fix applied to the `slider_position.php` file.
*   The advisory emphasizes the importance of using the latest version of the module to mitigate the risk.
