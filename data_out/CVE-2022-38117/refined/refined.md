{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Juiker app has an AES key hard-coded within its source code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hard-coded cryptographic key.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker with root privileges can use the hard-coded key to decrypt or tamper with the app's encrypted messages.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the device with root privileges.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker needs root privileges on the device where the vulnerable app is installed."
