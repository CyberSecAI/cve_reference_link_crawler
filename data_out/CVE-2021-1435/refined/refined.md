- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability in the web UI, specifically due to a lack of validation of user-supplied input. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user on the affected device. This could lead to complete system compromise including confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web UI of an affected device, with malicious commands injected into the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web UI of the device and be able to send crafted HTTP requests. The attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
