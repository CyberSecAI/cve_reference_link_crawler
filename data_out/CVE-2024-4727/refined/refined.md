Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application echoes user-supplied input from the `court_name` parameter directly into the HTML response without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Specifically, this is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This allows for various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `court_name` parameter in the `/admin/court-type` endpoint.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=1 onerror="alert(document.cookie)">`) and injects it into the `court_name` parameter.
- When a user visits the affected page with the crafted input, the JavaScript payload executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `court_name` parameter. This can be achieved by:
    - Directly submitting a crafted POST request to `/admin/court-type` with the malicious payload.
    - Crafting a malicious link that, when clicked by a user who is authenticated to the application, triggers the vulnerability.
    - Intercepting and modifying the request before it reaches the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in version 1.0 of the "Campcodes Legal Case Management System".
- The specific affected page is `/admin/court-type`.
- The provided proof-of-concept shows a sample POST request with a crafted payload that triggers an alert displaying the user's cookie.
- The system uses PHP, Apache, and MySQL.
- The vulnerable parameter is `court_name`.
