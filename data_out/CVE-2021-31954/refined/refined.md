Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer in the clfs.sys driver.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.

Attack vectors: Local attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
