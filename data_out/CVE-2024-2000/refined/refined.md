Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2000

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'navigation_dots' parameter of the Multi Scroll Widget within the Premium Addons PRO plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The plugin does not adequately clean or validate the data being passed to the `navigation_dots` parameter.
- Insufficient Output Escaping: The plugin does not properly encode or escape the output, allowing the injected scripts to execute when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser whenever a user views the page containing the vulnerable widget.
- Website compromise: XSS can be used to redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies/session data, deface websites and in some cases even take over administrator accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Input: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `navigation_dots` parameter of the Multi Scroll Widget settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least "contributor" level privileges or higher.
- Widget Modification: The attacker needs the ability to modify or create pages or posts with the Multi Scroll Widget.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Premium Addons PRO up to and including version 2.9.12.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.9.13.
