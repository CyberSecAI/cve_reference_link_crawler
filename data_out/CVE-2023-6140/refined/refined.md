- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly restrict file uploads, allowing users with limited privileges (like subscribers) to upload files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin allows users to upload ZIP archives containing PHP files, which can lead to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious ZIP file disguised as a font file via the `gsf_upload_fonts` AJAX action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber privileges. The attacker also needs to be able to craft and send a malicious zip file through a POST request.
