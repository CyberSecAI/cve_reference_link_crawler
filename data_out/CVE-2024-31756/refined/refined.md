- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A kernel handle leak exists in the Hw64.sys driver. This is due to the driver device being accessible by everyone on the local system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Kernel handle leak in the Hw64.sys driver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can be used for privilege escalation on a local system. Specifically, the kernel handle leak can be abused to gain privilege escalation by leveraging existing handles in other processes that communicate with the driver.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerable driver device is accessible to all local users, which allows the handle leak to be triggered from a low-privileged context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
