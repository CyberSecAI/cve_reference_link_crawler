- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter (MDTF) plugin does not properly implement CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website that makes a forged request to the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and have a user with sufficient privileges interact with it while logged into the vulnerable WordPress site.
