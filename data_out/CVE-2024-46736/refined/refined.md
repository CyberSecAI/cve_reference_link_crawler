The provided content relates to a fix for a double-put issue in the `smb2_rename_path` function within the Linux kernel's SMB client. This issue is directly related to the scenario described in the provided commit messages.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of the `@cfile` reference within the `smb2_rename_path` function. Specifically, when `smb2_set_path_attr` returns `-EINVAL` (indicating an invalid lease key), the reference of `@cfile` is dropped by the preceding `smb2_compound_op` call. Subsequent attempts to use the dropped reference can lead to a double-put issue if the operation needs to retry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The core issue is a race condition in handling the `@cfile` reference when a compound SMB request is retried. The code was not properly re-acquiring the `@cfile` after a failure. This double free can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exploitation of this issue can result in memory corruption, potentially leading to a system crash or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector would involve triggering a condition that leads to `smb2_set_path_attr()` returning `-EINVAL` within the context of a rename operation. This could be done by interacting with an SMB server in a way that causes lease invalidation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker would need to be able to interact with an SMB server in a way that triggers the `-EINVAL` return from the `smb2_set_path_attr` function which likely requires some knowledge of how leases work with SMB servers. They would also need to have the ability to cause a rename operation to be performed to trigger the vulnerable code path.
