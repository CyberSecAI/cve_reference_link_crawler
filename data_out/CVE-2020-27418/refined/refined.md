Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of screen buffer offsets in the `vgacon` driver when resizing the virtual terminal. When the screen is resized, the driver updates `vc->vc_size_row` to the new row size, but it uses `vga_vram_base` for `vc_origin` and `vc_visible_origin` instead of `vc_screenbuf`. This can lead to `vc_origin` and `vc_visible_origin` being smaller than `vc_screenbuf`. When a `TIOCLINUX` ioctl call is made, the new row size is used to calculate offsets, which could exceed the actual VGA VRAM size, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free (UAF): The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability when the `vgacon_invert_region` function attempts to access memory outside of the allocated VRAM.
- Incorrect offset calculation: The driver incorrectly uses `vga_vram_base` for origin calculations after resizing, rather than the actual screen buffer address.
- Lack of bounds checking: The driver does not properly validate the new screen size against the available VRAM before updating the screen size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The use-after-free triggers a Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASan) error, resulting in a kernel crash (as evidenced in the provided KASan report).
- Potential privilege escalation:  While the provided information doesn't explicitly state privilege escalation, a kernel crash may be a stepping stone for local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  `VT_RESIZEX` ioctl call: The attacker first resizes the virtual terminal to a large size using the `VT_RESIZEX` ioctl call.
- `TIOCLINUX` ioctl call with `TIOCL_SETSEL`: The attacker then triggers the vulnerability by calling the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl call with `TIOCL_SETSEL` to trigger the incorrect offset calculation and subsequent out-of-bounds access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user access: The attacker needs to be a local user who can open and manipulate the virtual terminal device (`/dev/char/4:1`) and use the `ioctl` system call.
- Basic understanding of terminal control ioctls: The attacker must know to use `VT_RESIZEX` and `TIOCLINUX` ioctls.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is related to and also fixes CVE-2020-8647 and CVE-2020-8649.
- A test program is provided in the commit message to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the new screen size does not exceed the available VRAM size during resizing.
