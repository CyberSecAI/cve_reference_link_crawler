The provided content relates to CVE-2024-47676.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the `hugetlb_fault()` function within the Linux kernel. This occurs because `vmf_anon_prepare()` can drop the per-VMA lock, which may allow the current VMA to be freed before `hugetlb_vma_unlock_read()` is called.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the hugetlb fault handling pathway.
- Incorrect handling of VMA locking, specifically within the `vmf_anon_prepare()` function which can release the lock prematurely.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially trigger a UAF, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered via the hugetlb fault pathway.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger a hugetlb fault. It is not specified if this requires specific user privileges.
