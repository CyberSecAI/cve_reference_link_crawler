*  NetApp Advisory for Java Vulnerabilities lists CVE-2019-2992 as part of the "October 2019 Java Platform Standard Edition Vulnerabilities"

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2019-2992.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
        *   Excessive memory allocation in the CMap when reading TrueType font files within OpenJDK.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        *   Improper handling of TrueType fonts, leading to excessive memory allocation.
        *   Insufficient bounds checking when processing CMap data.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing application crash.

   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   By processing a maliciously crafted TrueType font file, either loaded directly by the application or through a library call.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
        *   Ability to provide a maliciously crafted TrueType font file to an application using OpenJDK font parsing libraries

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is located within the 2D graphics component of OpenJDK
* Various systems, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, openSUSE, Debian and multiple NetApp products are affected, all having used OpenJDK,  and IBM JDK which includes code from OpenJDK

In summary, CVE-2019-2992 is caused by a flaw in how OpenJDK handles TrueType fonts, leading to excessive memory allocation and potential denial-of-service conditions. Attackers can exploit this by providing specially crafted font files.
