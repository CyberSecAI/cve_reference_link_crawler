- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the administrative console of Absolute Secure Access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with system administrator privileges can inject malicious scripts into the management UI. When another administrator edits the same object, the script executes in their browser. The impact on system integrity is high, while there's no impact on system availability or data confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have system administrator permissions in the Absolute Secure Access platform, and the attack is carried out by modifying a management object that another admin later edits.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to have system administrator privileges on the Secure Access platform. They must be able to create or edit management objects within the Secure Access administrative console.
