Danswer is the AI Assistant connected to company's docs, apps, and people. Danswer is vulnerable to unauthorized access to GET/SET of Slack Bot Tokens. Anyone with network access can steal slack bot tokens and set them. This implies full compromise of the customer's slack bot, leading to internal Slack access. This issue was patched in version 3.63.
