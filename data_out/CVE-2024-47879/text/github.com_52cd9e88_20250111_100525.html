# PreviewExpressionCommand, which is eval, lacks protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

High

GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

maven

org.openrefine:main
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<3.8.3

## Patched versions

3.8.3

## Description

### Summary

Lack of CSRF protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code.

The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row.

### Details

The `com.google.refine.commands.expr.PreviewExpressionCommand` class contains the following comment:

```
/**
 * The command uses POST but does not actually modify any state so it does not require CSRF.
 */

```

However, this appears to be false (or no longer true). The expression being previewed (executed) can be written in GREL, Python, or Clojure. Since there are no restrictions on what code can be executed, the expression can do anything the user running OpenRefine can do. For instance, the following expressions start a calculator:

```
clojure:(.exec (Runtime/getRuntime) "gnome-calculator")

```

```
jython:import os;os.system("gnome-calculator")

```

The lack of restrictions on expressions is arguably not a problem if the user is typing their own expressions into OpenRefine: they could have just as well typed them into Clojure or Python directly. However, since the `preview-expression` command does not check for a CSRF token, the expression can actually come from a HTML form submitted by a different origin, including arbitrary websites.

Issue [#2164](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2164) suggested adding CSRF protection to all endpoints, but this endpoint was skipped (and the above comment added) in the associated PR [#2182](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2182).

### PoC

An example "malicious" page is at <https://wandernauta.nl/or/> (of course, actual malicious pages would not wait for the victim to press the submit button).

The following curl command (substituting the project ID) also demonstrates the issue:

```
curl -d project=123456789 -d cellIndex=1 -d rowIndices='[0]' -d 'expression=clojure:(.exec (Runtime/getRuntime) "gnome-calculator")' http://localhost:3333/command/core/preview-expression/
```
### Impact

CSRF into remote code execution, provided the attacker knows at least one project ID in the victim's workspace and can convince the victim to open a malicious webpage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
