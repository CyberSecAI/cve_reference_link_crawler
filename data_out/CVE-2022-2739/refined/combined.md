| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-08-31 20:45:00 UTC  ``` A flaw was discovered in Podman before upstream version 2.0.5. When using the deprecated Varlink API or the Docker-compatible REST API, if multiple containers are created in a short duration, the environment variables from the first containers will get leaked into subsequent containers. An attacker who has control over those subsequent containers may get access to secrets shared with previous containers through environment variables.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-21 10:59:00 UTC  ``` The flaw lies in pkg/spec/spec.go:createConfigToOCISpec() function, where the variable DefaultEnvVariables of the env package is used and modified without making a copy of it. Thus when creating multiple containers in such a way that createConfigToOCISpec() is used, variables defined for previously created containers are leaked to newer containers.  Function createConfigToOCISpec() is used by varlink API or by the REST API, in particular the Docker-compatible API.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-21 11:03:02 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/containers/podman/commit/a7e864e6e7de894d4edde4fff00e53dc6a0b5074>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-21 13:58:56 UTC  ``` To actually get access to possible secrets passed through environment variables, an attacker would require access to containers in the infrastructure, created in such a way to trigger this flaw.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-21 14:29:07 UTC  ``` By default, in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 when using the podman socket/service through systemd, the varlink session automatically expires after 60 seconds, so to leak environment variables from one container to another they have to be created in a short time.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-22 08:43:28 UTC  ``` Created podman tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1881345](show_bug.cgi?id=1881345 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14370 podman: environment variables leak between containers when started via Varlink or Docker-compatible REST API [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-10-27 14:54:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6  Via RHSA-2020:4297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4297)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-10-27 20:21:36 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-14370>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-11-10 13:54:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2020:5056 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5056](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5056)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c19)  Mark Cooper    2020-12-12 03:01:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Whilst OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) does include podman, the Varlink API is not enabled by default. However, as it is trivial to activate this feature, OCP has been marked as affected.  OCP 3.11 has previously packaged podman, but instead now relies on the version from rhel-extra.The older version previously packaged is not vulnerable to this CVE and hence has been marked not affected.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1874268#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-16 14:21:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:0531 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0531](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0531)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2116927#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-08-09 14:47:17 UTC  ``` The podman packages version podman-1.6.4-32.el7_9 as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2022:2190 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2190](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2190)) included an incorrect version of podman that was missing multiple bug and security fixes. One of the fixes regressed in that update was the fix for [CVE-2020-14370](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14370), that was previously corrected in the podman packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2020:5056 ([https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5056](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5056)). The [CVE-2022-2739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2739) was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the podman packages produced by Red Hat.  The original issue - [CVE-2020-14370](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14370) - could possibly allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored in environment variables. For more details about the original issue, see:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14370> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-14370>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2116927#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-08-22 09:15:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2022:6119 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6119](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A6119)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2116927#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-09-02 12:25:50 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-2739>   ``` |  |
