{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A security regression was introduced in a podman package, specifically version podman-1.6.4-32.el7_9, released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras. This version inadvertently lacked the fix for CVE-2020-14370, which was previously addressed. The regression occurred due to an incorrect version of podman being included in the RHSA-2022:2190 advisory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness lies in the failure to include the necessary fix for CVE-2020-14370 in the released podman package.",
      "A source code management issue led to the inclusion of an incorrect podman version."
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability allows an attacker with control over subsequent containers to access sensitive information stored in environment variables. The original issue, CVE-2020-14370, involved environment variable leakage between containers when started via the deprecated Varlink API or Docker-compatible REST API. This vulnerability regression allows a potential attacker to gain access to secrets shared with previous containers through environment variables.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker must have the ability to create multiple containers within a short period using the deprecated Varlink API or Docker-compatible REST API.",
       "The attacker would then need control over a container created after a previous container that defined sensitive environment variables to exploit the leakage and access those variables."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and control multiple containers via the deprecated Varlink API or Docker-compatible REST API, and the containers need to be created in a short duration to trigger the leakage."
