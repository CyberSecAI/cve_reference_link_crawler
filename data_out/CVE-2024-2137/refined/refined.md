Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2137

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "All-in-One Addons for Elementor â€“ WidgetKit" WordPress plugin, specifically affecting multiple pricing widgets (e.g., Pricing Single, Pricing Icon, Pricing Tab).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the pricing widget settings and escapes output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within a page. This script executes whenever a user accesses the page.
- **Potential for Malicious Activity:** The impact of this is that attackers could potentially perform actions such as:
    - Cookie theft
    - Redirect users to malicious sites
    - Modify content on the page
    - Gain administrative access

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Pricing Widget Settings:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code via the settings of the affected pricing widgets (e.g., Pricing Single, Pricing Icon, Pricing Tab).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access or higher.
- **Plugin Access:** Attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin to modify pages using the vulnerable pricing widgets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.5.1.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
- The provided source code shows that the output is being escaped using `esc_html` and `esc_attr` in many places, but it is likely the case that this escaping is not sufficient, or missing in key areas, allowing for the XSS injection.
