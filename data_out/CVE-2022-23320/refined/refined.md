The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the XMPie uStore platform discovered during a penetration test. The vulnerabilities include default credentials, SQL injection, and persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The application ships with a default username and password ("admin") which are not required to be changed during initial setup.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application allows administrators to execute arbitrary SQL queries via a built-in feature for setting events or generating reports.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored and executed within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** Usage of default credentials.
*   **SQL Injection:** Unrestricted access to raw SQL queries with administrative privileges.
*   **Persistent XSS:** Lack of input validation and output sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Default Credentials:** Complete compromise of the application via access to the administrative dashboard.
*   **SQL Injection:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data including password hashes, customer information, and decryption keys.
*   **Persistent XSS:** Client-side code execution leading to potential cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other unwanted actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Default Credentials:** Direct login attempts using the default credentials.
*   **SQL Injection:** Exploitation of the custom SQL query functionality in the admin panel.
*   **Persistent XSS:** Inputting malicious JavaScript into vulnerable user input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Default Credentials:** Network access to the application's login page.
*   **SQL Injection:** Access to the administrative panel.
*  **Persistent XSS:** Access to the administrative panel.
