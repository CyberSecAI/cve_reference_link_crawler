OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US

XMPie technology is used widely by a variety of enterprises and industries across the globe to transform customer communications.

âIn the last 3 years we’ve grown at more than 25% rate and we actually believe that it is due to the fact that we bought the full suite of XMPie products 3 years ago and it’s transformed our business from a digital printing company to a technology business.â

“We’ve done email campaigns using XMPie personalization that have achieved 47 per cent response rate. The clients had to shut down the campaign because it was too successful!â
