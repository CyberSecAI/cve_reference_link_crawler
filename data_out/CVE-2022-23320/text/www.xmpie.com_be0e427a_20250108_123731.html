Version 18.0Â released September 29, 2024Â  Â |Â  Â Watch a shortÂ [video overview](https://campus.xmpie.com/Tutorial/Whats-new-in-uStore-v18)

**New product**

1. Added: A new type of product has been added to uStore: **Easy Upload**.
   The Easy Upload product allows shoppers to upload their own files directly from the storefront. They can then define print properties such as lamination, paper size and binding type, and preview the document in real-time as they apply these properties.
   Documents can be set to be preflight validated after upload.
   [Read more](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=Easy_Upload_Product_Flow.htm)Â Â  Â  Â |Â  Â  Â Â [Video training](https://campus.xmpie.com/Legacy/DocVideo/2e490317-8179-4130-c40e-08dcd60a40ee?auth=055117185069109030099233017055162031134053165081)

**General enhancements**

1. Added: Shoppers can now add an email address to both the billing and shipping addresses during the checkout process.
2. Added: Weâve added the ability to include EORI (Economic Operators Registration and Identification) and Tax ID numbers in both billing and shipping addresses. These distinct identification numbers are crucial for businesses engaged in international trade and e-commerce within the European Union.
   * EORI Number:Â A unique identifier used by customs authorities to track and manage economic operators in the EU. Essential for smooth import and export processes.
   * Tax ID:Â A key identifier used for VAT and other tax-related purposes within the EU.

   By including these numbers in your addresses, store administrators ensure full compliance with EU regulations, expedite customs processing, and facilitate accurate VAT handling, reducing the risk of delays or errors in your cross-border transactions.
   This option is configured in the Store Setup > Delivery Settings tab.
3. Added: The phone and fax numbers can now be displayed in the receipt.
4. Fixed: uStore now supports the use of secure PDFs in Composite products, provided they permit viewing and printing.
5. The following PDFs are not accepted:
   * PDFs that require a password to open.
   * PDFs that restrict printing.
   * Note that the “ByPassPdfSecurityOnPrintOrEdit” key is no longer supported.

**Dynamic product enhancements**

1. Added: Store administrators can set the resolution of the product preview to “Auto,” allowing the system to automatically calculate the optimal online display resolution based on the InDesign document size.
   This feature is available for dynamic products using PersonalEffect version 13.1.1 or higher.
   The preview can be set to “Auto” in the Proof section of the product’s setup page.
2. Added: Store administrators can configure how the image editor opens: manually by the user, automatically upon image upload or selection, or only if the selected image is invalid and needs to be fixed.
3. Added: It is now possible zoom out of an image in the image editor in order to fit the entire image into the frame.

**Widgets (Beta)**

1. Added: New ready-to-use widgets which can be downloaded and added into your storefront. These widgets allow you to replace the Aqua-Blue Homepage banner, add a featured-products carousel, and insert custom HTML code on NG pages.
   Please note that widgets are still in Beta, so be sure to thoroughly test them before using on your production stores.

Support for new version of Xerox FreeFlow Core

uStore supports the new version of Xerox FreeFlow Core â version 7.0.11, soon to be released by FreeFlow Core.
Please refer to theÂ [FreeFlow Core release notes](https://www.support.xerox.com/en-us/product/core/documentation?language=en).

Â Version 17.2 released June 16, 2024Â  Â |Â  Â Watch a shortÂ [video overview](https://campus.xmpie.com/Tutorial/Whats-new-in-uStore-v17.2)Â

**Backoffice enhancements****Â**

1. New behavior: Now, even if you’ve made changes to a product before taking it offline, you will not loose your changes. You can edit an online product and then take it offline directly from its editing pages (such as pricing, properties setup and delivery), rather than have to go back to the main product page to take it offline and lose your edits.
2. New behavior: When defining the gallery list or grid control, there is no longer a need to set a default value.
3. Added: In the list of global product properties, filters have been added to theÂ Name and Control Type columns to help narrow down search for the required product property.
4. Added: The Order Approval Process is now supported in B2C stores.
5. Added: The Excel Pricing file now includes the ProfileID field (in the General Inputs area). It displays the the profile ID (if such exists) related to the current product.
6. Added: Two new slots for placing widgets in the User menu have been added in the Theme editor. These slots are located at the top and bottom of this menu.

**UI enhancements**

1. Added: In the shopping cart, you can now see what’s inside a kit. We’ve added an “Included Products” link that opens a tooltip displaying all the products included in the kit.
2. Added: When creating a dynamic product (set with single-page flow), thumbnails are now automatically generated. If there are more than 10 images, bullets will be displayed instead.
3. Added: The image selector now supports PNG image assets, including PNG transparency, also in XLIM.
4. Fixed: NG stores now display the step description, as defined in the Customization Wizard > Step Details page.

**New offeringÂ**

* Added: uStore now supports SMS touchpoints created in Circle in Campaign on Demand products.

**Technical enhancements**

* Added: uStore streamlines the retrieval of output files for by allowing customers to set a specific destination where output files are automatically downloaded. This eliminates the need to manually access a file system or download files individually from the UI. Files are initially copied to an S3 cloud environment, from where they can be downloaded using any S3 utility, and transferred to the local network for printing.
* Added: FedEx Web Services will soon be retired. The SOAP based FedEx Web Services are in development containment and have been replaced with FedEx RESTful APIs. You will need to upgrade your integration from Web Services to FedEx APIs, as described in see [Retirement of FedEx Web Services](https://help.xmpie.com/KBA/index.htm#t=0106%2F0106_Retirement_of_FedEx_Web_Services_Tracking.htm).
* Enhancement: NG theme developments are now available through HTTPS. Hybrid pages will not be available.
* Enhancement: Configuration management has been improved. Out-of-the-box Web.config parameters are now stored in the database for easier access and updates.Â During installation, all out-of-the-box parameters will be automatically saved to the database with their default values. This eliminates the need to manually modify the Web.config file after each installation.

  The following Web.config parameters are now saved to the database:CalculateCostOnAddToCart
  CalculateCouponDeductionOnRLPrice
  CalculateTaxBeforeCouponDeduction
  EnableRecipientListValidation
  EnableSearchHistory
  FileSubmissionUploadPaperSizeTolerance
  HandleEXIFOrientation

  RadAsyncUploadChunkSize

  These parameters can be found at the bottom of the [Global Configuration table](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=Presets%2FGlobal_Configurations_Table.htm).
  For any customized parameters you’ve made, you’ll need to update those values in Presets > System Setup > Global Configuration after installation.
* The widget mechanism has been improved in the following areas:
  + Context is injected into the widget, to control its behavior according to its location.
  + Specific model data is sent to the widget, if the slot is placed inside a component such as a product item box.
  + A router is now supported within the widget, so widgets can now behave as single-page-applications (SPA) and redirect to an internal URL without loading the whole page.

**Accessibility improvement**

* Added: Web content accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have been implemented in the header and in the cookie ribbon areas of the storefront.

**Security update**

* Deprecated: The following clearing models have been deprecated:
  + Moneris
  + PayPal Payflow Pro
  + No clearing, when set with the credit card collection method.

If you have been using these clearing methods, you can continue using them until **September 2024**.Â XMPie strongly recommends you adopt other methods we support as soon as possible.

Version 17.1 released February 18, 2024Â  Â |Â  Â Watch a shortÂ [video overview](https://campus.xmpie.com/Tutorial/Whats-new-in-uStore-v17.1)

1. Added: It is now possible to copy order items directlyÂ  within the cart. There is no need to re-add products; simply duplicate and adjust as needed.
   Note that items that include USADATA and cross-media products cannot be duplicated.
2. Added: It is now possible to reorder complete orders from your order history (“My Orders”) page.
3. Added: During the ordering process of dynamic products, customers now have the ability to edit library image assets, provided by the uStore administrator,Â without leaving the selection flow.

5. Added: When setting a static product, in the “Allow Download after Purchase”Â section, you can upload a file that will be downloaded by the customerÂ from the Order History pageÂ after a purchase has been made. Up until now, you had to place this file in the file system.Â

Version 17.0 released November 5, 2023Â  Â |Â  Â Watch a shortÂ [video overview](https://campus.xmpie.com/Tutorial/Whats-new-in-uStore-v17)

**Discontinuation:**Â The Coffee skin is being discontinued and custom JavaScript on the cart page will no longer be functional.

**Dynamic product**

1. Added:Â The dynamic product has been redesigned for a better, faster and visually appealing user experience in NG stores.
   The new design allows the shopper to complete the product ordering process on a single page by selectingÂ the newÂ single-pageÂ flow option.Â Â Â [Read more](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=StoreSetup%2FSetting_the_Store_Mode.htm)
   You may want to select the **multiple-page legacy** flow option to maintain backward compatibility in the following cases:
   * Stores to which custom JavaScript or complex HTML has been applied.
   * The product uses Pricing Excel which relies on customization values for pricing.
   * The dynamic product properties rely on customization values.

   Dynamic products with one of the following settings will be shown in the multiple-page flow:

   * Include custom input controls written in ASPX
   * The uProduce version lower than 11.3
   * Include recipient lists or uEdit
   * Include 3D type products
   * Include a text dial defined with a text input control that is set with “Use Rich Text Editor”
   * Include an image dialÂ of a deprecated type
   * Include an image dial defined with “Take values from Data source”

2. Added:Â It is now possible to determine whether to display in the store customization steps before properties, or vice versa. This isÂ applicableÂ for dynamic products with single-page flow, and isÂ defined in the store’s setup page.
   Read moreÂ inÂ Â [English](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=StoreSetup%2FSetting_the_Store_Mode.htm)Â Â [Deutsch](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/de/index.htm#t=StoreSetup%2FSetting_the_Store_Mode.htm)Â  Â [FranÃ§ais](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/fr/index.htm#t=StoreSetup%2FSetting_the_Store_Mode.htm)Â
3. Added: When editing a dynamic product, the preview can now update automatically following any customization change, so there is no need to click the “Refresh Preview” button. This is available in mobile as well.This optionÂ is set in the product’s set up page and is available only for products defined in the single-page flow.
   Note that using this option for documents with complex logic or design could potentially slow down the website and thus affect the shopperâs customization experience.
   Automatic refresh requires uProduce Server version 11.3 or above.
   Read moreÂ inÂ Â [English](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â Â [Deutsch](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/de/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â  Â [FranÃ§ais](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/fr/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â
4. Added: It is possible to set the DPI resolution of the product preview.Â Higher resolution improves the preview’s quality, but takes longer to process.
   This option is available only for dynamic products set to single-page flow.
   Read moreÂ inÂ Â [English](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/en/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â Â [Deutsch](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/de/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â  Â [FranÃ§ais](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/Latest/Help/fr/index.htm#t=ProductSetup%2FSetting_Up_a_Proof.htm)Â
5. Added:Â The gallery image selector in the store has an improved look.
   The images selector provides editing features for uploaded images, including scaling, cropping, flipping horizontally or vertically and rotation. This is also available for mobile.
   The image selector allows to upload files up to the size of 5 MB.
6. **Important!** Up until now, in dynamic products set in the legacy multiple-page flow, when a storefront customer did not fill in a mandatory customization field and clicked the “Refresh Preview” button, an error message appeared and the preview was not updated.Â
7. Now, in the single-page flow, if the customer leaves some of the mandatory fields blank, these empty fields will be passed to the plan and handled by the plan logic. Therefore, if you intend to upgrade a legacy product to the single-page flow, make sure the plan can handle empty values, and test the result before placing it online.
8. Limitation: If a dynamic product, set with single-page flow, has a property which takes values from the uStore db data source, and relies on customization values, then unexpected behavior may occur.
   This scenario is not supported, and you are advised to use the multi-page flow instead.

**Shopping cart**

1. Added: The shopping cart has been redesigned for a better and more modern user experience.
   Note that if you applied custom functionality to the cart page by adding JavaScript code to your store,Â  this functionality will no longer work. You are advised to add the functionality to a custom theme.
2. Added: The shopper can empty the cart of all products at once.
3. Added:Â The shopping cart icon located at the top right corner of the store now shows the*Â*total number of items in the cart.

**uStore Connect Enterprise**

1. Added: A new store type,Â uStore Connect Enterprise, has been created.
   This store can be integrated with 3rd party applications. Customers are redirected from within their application to uStore for a flow which starts in the homepage up until and including the cart, and are then directed back to the 3rd party application.
   In the uStore Connect Enterprise store products can be organized in the cart by lists. Each list can be exported to an external service, and then be submitted as an order via the API.
   This is not an out-of-the-box store type and you will need to purchase it separately.

1. Â Added: The Excel pricing file of a static product can now control the behavior of properties.

   Using the Excel, you can control which options of a property are available to the shopper according to his/her selection. For example, when the shopper selects a silk page, which cannot be laminated, the glossy lamination option is removed.
   Visibility of a property can also be controlled by the Excel.
   The value selected by the shopper can be overridden by the Excel, allowing you to set a value for a property.Â  Read more inÂ  [English](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/v.15.0/Help/en/index.htm#t=Setting_Property_Dependency_with_Excel_Pricing.htm)Â Â [Deutsch](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/v.15.0/Help/de/index.htm#t=Setting_Property_Dependency_with_Excel_Pricing.htm)Â  Â [FranÃ§ais](https://help.xmpie.com/uStore/v.15.0/Help/fr/index.htm#t=Setting_Property_Dependency_with_Excel_Pricing.htm) Â  Â  Â |Â  Â  Â  [Video training](https://campus.xmpie.com/Legacy/DocVideo/754f26fa-b04b-45ed-6896-08da05621ce1?auth=183045228091170196244215008247105094136061194102)
2. Added: An improved Excel pricing template is now available for all product types, excluding Upload products.
   It is now easier to add properties to the Excel, by adding their names only.
   The Excel, which can be defined with all properties in the store, has a mechanism that knows which property is defined for the ordered product, allowing it to calculate only the properties that are applicable for the ordered product.

1. Enhancement:Â Security of stores has been hardened.Â The option to secure critical points onlyÂ has been removed . Stores that were set up to secure critical points have been changed to secure **all** pages.

   **Important!** The system no longer supports having both secured and non-secured stores on the same domain/sub-domain.
   If you have both secured and non-secured stores on the same domain/sub-domain, please change the non-secured ones to be secured (or vice versa, although not recommended), or shoppers may have a problem accessing them.
### Â

### Version 14.1 (9296) released January 18, 2022

1. Â Added: Circle analytics in XM products.
   It is now possible to view Circle analytics reports for XM products in NG stores, instead of the old Marketing Console reports.
   Legacy stores will continue showing Marketing Console reports only.
   By default, NG stores will automatically switch to show the new Circle analytics reports. If you want to revert to the Marketing Console reports, you can do so in the Global Configurations table of the back office.
   Note that Marketing Console was deprecated on January 1, 2022 and will be discontinued on January 1, 2023 (See [Marketing Console Discontinuation FAQ](https://www.xmpie.com/marketing-console-discontinuation-faq/)).Â  In order to have Circle analytics for XM products, you will have to upgrade to this version or higher.
2. Added: CAPTCHAThe account lockout option, which is used to lock out an account when someone tries to log on unsuccessfully several times in a row, has been enhanced to include CAPTCHA for better security.

3. Added: Excel pricing now supports the XLookup and XMatch functions.
4. Updated: Changes in behavior of datetime picker input control.

5. Â Fixed: A few low and medium risk security issues have been fixed.
   It is advisable to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.
6. Limitation:Â It is not possible to use the Text cell format to return a price in Excel pricing. If used, the calculation will be incorrect. Use the Accounting, Number or General cell format instead.

### Â

### Version 14 (8963) released October 4, 2021

1. Added: Product property controls of static products have been redesigned with NG for a better user experience. These controls, which are based on ReactJS,Â are available in the newÂ single–pageÂ mode in NG stores.Â — File attachment: An area to which files can be dragged has been added, as well as a file upload button. Files in the repository can be easily searched for.
   — Date time picker: Faster and more accurate selection of date and time is now possible, as well as manual insertion of date and time.
   —Â Gallery grid and gallery list: A larger image area is now available. Out-of-the-box properties have new and modern-looking images.
   — Radio button: Radio buttons have taken the form of buttons having text with no image.
   — Additional controls: Text boxes, dropdown lists and checkboxes also have a new look and feel.Â HTML generic maintains backward compatibility to ensure operability of your HTML and JavaScript code.

   Note:Â Products that contain properties written in ASPX only will be displayed in the multiple-page flow.
2. Added: The price of static products in NG stores isÂ nowÂ immediatelyÂ calculated, resulting in the removal of the Update Price link.
   Using Excel pricing a product can be priced even if not all properties have selected values. The shopper can thus see the cheapest available price for the current selections.
   To support automatic update, Excel must handle empty values. This is controlled by the “ExcelSupportsEmptyValues”Â key in the Global Configurations table.
   If your Excel files do not support empty values, set the “ExcelSupportsEmptyValues” key to false, for backward compatibility. In this case,Â  recalculation will take place only when all property controls have selected values, as in previous versions.
3. Deprecated: Legacy stores.
   Starting from this version, you can no longer create new legacy stores. Existing legacy stores will keep on working and legacy will still be supported.Â If you switch a store from legacy to NG, you will no longer be able to revert to legacy.
4. Deprecated: Microsoft office engine for Excel pricing will be deprecated in version 15.
5. Updated: Starting from patch #1961 of v.13.4 including v.14 and higher, theme development environment requires NodeJS version 16.3.Â
6. Updated: The new NG gallery list and gallery grid icons have a new location that is shared across all themes.
   When upgrading a custom theme, you will have to copy the property icons to the new location.

Â

2. Added: It is now possible to easily upload a design of a product for production.

   This is available for static products using the file attachment control, which is set with “Use as Production Output” option.

### Â

### Version 12.0 (6681) released November 25, 2019

1. Added: uStore brings the ability to visualize dynamic products in 3D.A stand up pouch, a label on a bottle, a carton box and a business card with gold foiling, to name a few, can now be better perceived in 3D.
   The new uC3D technology supports personalized designs, dynamically added flexible-packaging finishing, such as zipper and valve, dynamic embellishments like embossing, cutting and hole punching, selective lamination, hot foiling, holographic effects, and more.
2. Added: uStore allows a shopper to download a dieline, design within it using Illustrator or other tools, and then upload it as a PDF.
   The PDF can run through a preflight process to prevent production errors. If an error is found, a report is issued, highlighting the errors on top of the PDF.
   This workflow is provided in the Customization step and in the Finalize step, by the File Attachment control.
   The preflight profile can be generated using Adobe Acrobat DC or Callas pdfToolbox, and configured via FreeFlow Core.
3. Added: A new trigger event is now available: Order is Ready for Fulfillment.
   This event is fired once the order gets to the Pending queue, before it splits into order items. There are no out-of-the box actions available for this event, but it allows integrating new actions for handling a complete order, such as sending a notification to an ERP system once per order.
4. Added: Store supports the new version of Xerox FreeFlow Core â version 5.4. Please refer to theÂ [FreeFlow Core release notes](http://www.support.xerox.com/support/core/documentation/enus.html?operatingSystem=win81x64&fileLanguage=en).

### Â

### Version 11.0 (6191) released July 31, 2019

1. Â Added: uStore introduces a new product type: Kit product. A Kit product is a collection of various products which are grouped together to be sold as one single offering.
   A kit enables the shopper to order multiple products in one order. Using the kit, the shopper experiences a quick and efficient workflow: with a single click, the shopper can place multiple products in the shopping cart, instead of having to browse the store in search of these items. In addition, if the kit contains multiple dynamic products, customization is done once for the entire kit, and there is no need to customize each product individually.
   Kits are prepared by the administrator, and the user does not need to figure out or remember which products need to be ordered. Also, the kit product is optimized for repeated orders and racks inventory levels of the included products.
2. Â Important: If you are using a customized NG theme that was created with an earlier version, you will need to update the theme in order to use the kitting feature with your customized theme. [Read more](https://github.com/XMPieLab/uStore-NG/wiki/Upgrading-a-Custom-Theme)
3. Limitation: The receipt has been enhanced to display the kit and its components in a hierarchical structure.
   After upgrading to uStore 11, when adding a kit product to an existing store, the product structure of the receipt does not display the hierarchy of the kit and its components. To display the kit in a hierarchical structure, click **Restore Default Receipt** in the **Receipt Setup** window. The same issue applies to customized triggered email templates.

### Â

3. Added: While fulfilling an order, it is now possible to add ad-hoc production information for the ordered item, on top of the information provided by the customer via product properties.Â This can be done by adding global properties to an order item and assigning values to them.
4. Added: When creating a static product with a PDF document, thumbnails are now automatically generated from the PDF.Â Â The first two PDF pages (or any number youâll set) will be automatically converted to JPG thumbnails.
5. Added: When creating a static product with a PDF document, preflight data (such as page size and color space) is now recorded for the document, similarly to an uploaded PDF via a composite product.Â  This allows generation of reports with this data.
   Note that this feature does not support PDF documents with over 200 pages.
6. Added: The Excel pricing of an uploaded file in a composite product now contains the properties, fulfillment and product ID of the composite product. This enables to calculate the price for the upload products based on the properties of the composite.
### Â

1. Added: The Product List page shows all products with an infinite scroll.
2. Added: Shipping tax takes into account the different tax rates of products within a shipment. This results in a lower tax in case the shipment includes tax-exempt products.

Â Version 10.0 (5424) released March 17, 2019Â Â

1. Added: A new store type – uStore NG – with a new frontend technology, including:
   – A new theme, AquaBlue, with a new homepage, header and footer and category page.
   – CSS variables support for themes which affect both the new and legacy pages in a uStore NG store.
   – A theme coding framework in React.js which allows development of new themes.Â [Read more](https://github.com/XMPieLab/uStore-NG/wiki).
   – Ability to assign an image to a product group.
2. Added: A WYSIWYG theme editor for uStore NG stores with a draft mode.
3. Added: uStore supports the new version of Xerox FreeFlow Core – version 5.1.0.9. Please refer to theÂ [FreeFlow Core release notes](http://www.support.xerox.com/support/core/documentation/enus.html?operatingSystem=win81x64&fileLanguage=en).
4. Changed: The skin folders of Legacy stores moved to a new location: \\uStoreShared\Skins. This allows easier sharing of skin files between uStore servers within a cluster.
5. Backward compatibility: When upgrading to uStore 10.0, all existing stores will be assigned a Legacy store type. This will ensure your stores will not undergo any changes and will maintain operability, including skins, plugins and javascripts.
6. Limitations:
   – Currently, uStore NG mode is available for B2B stores only. B2C and uStore Connect stores receive the Legacy mode.
   – NG stores do not support Internet Explorer.
   – Currently, uStore NG stores use the new React.js technology in the homepage, header and footer and category page only. In all other pages the new technology is used in the header and footer, and the content of the page resides inÂ an iFrame and uses the Legacy technology (ASP.NET).

Â

5. Know issue: A file uploaded with a file attachment product property is not deleted in a GDPR supported store. In case these files contain PII, delete them from \\ustoreShared\FileattAchments\ no later than 30 days after they were created (136594).
6. Caution! When deleting a user, ensure there are no orders for this user which haven’t yet been fulfilled. Deleting the user beforehand may cause errors in fulfillment and production.
