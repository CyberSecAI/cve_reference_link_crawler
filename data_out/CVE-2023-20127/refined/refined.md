Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-20127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient protection of sensitive data in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive information about network devices managed by the affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain access to privileged information about network devices, potentially including configurations, credentials, or other sensitive details. This can be used for further attacks or reconnaissance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote Attack: The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the web-based management interface.
*   Authenticated Attack: The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the web interface of the affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure instance.
*   Specifically, the attacker needs a low-privileged user account.
*   The attacker has to "take certain actions within the configuration pages of the network devices."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Cisco Prime Infrastructure web interface.
*   The attacker needs valid credentials for a low-privileged user account on the affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to navigate and manipulate the web interface to trigger the information disclosure.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another and exploitation of one is not required to exploit the other.
* The advisory also mentions that a software release affected by one of the vulnerabilities might not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.
* No workarounds are available and the only solution is a software update.
