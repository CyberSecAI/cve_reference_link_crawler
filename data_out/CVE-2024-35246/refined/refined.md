{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper Control of Interaction Frequency.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The device does not properly control the frequency of incoming packets.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a large number of packets repeatedly.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack, sending many packets repeatedly to the vulnerable device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device. No user interaction or privileges are required for the attack."
