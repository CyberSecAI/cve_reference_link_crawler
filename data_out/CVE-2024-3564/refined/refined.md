Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3564

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `locate_template()` function within the `content_block` shortcode in the 'Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget)' plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly restrict the template files that can be included, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin uses `locate_template()` to find a template file based on user-supplied input via the shortcode attribute. The plugin attempts to restrict included files to those in the theme/child-theme directory, but this restriction can be bypassed.
- **Insecure use of `locate_template()`:** The plugin uses `locate_template()` to resolve template file paths which allows inclusion of files outside the intended template directories.
- **Lack of proper input sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately validate or sanitize the template file path provided in the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files located on the server. This allows for complete control over the server environment, including bypassing access controls, reading sensitive data, and modifying files, ultimately leading to full server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Attribute Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the template attribute of the `content_block` shortcode. By setting the template attribute to a malicious file, an attacker can force the server to include and execute that file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher. This means that the attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Ability to use Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to add shortcodes to the WordPress site, which is normally only possible for contributors and higher user roles.
