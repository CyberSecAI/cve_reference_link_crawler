This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

http0.9: process headers if there are non-space characters

```
Previously, we fell back on HTTP/0.9 if there was a missing protocol
except if the following line cintained a colon.

This makes libhtp stricter to consider a transaction as 0.9
by only accepting if we have spaces after the request line

as done in libhtp-rs

Ticket: 6643

And do not consider HTTP/0.9 if there is too much junk afterward.

Avoids quadratic complexity with probing many whitespaces lines.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
