Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `libhtp` handles malformed HTTP request lines, specifically when the protocol is missing.
-  A previous commit introduced a check for non-space characters after the request line to determine if it was HTTP/0.9 or if headers were present. However, this check had a quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU usage with certain malformed inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Quadratic Complexity:** The core weakness is the inefficient algorithm used to probe for headers after a missing protocol in the request line, leading to a quadratic time complexity. Specifically, the code iterates through the input looking for a colon, which is indicative of HTTP headers, after a missing protocol. If the protocol is missing and the data after the request line consists of spaces or junk data, this process becomes very slow.
- **Lack of Input Limit:** The initial implementation lacked a limit on how much data it would probe when trying to determine if a request with a missing protocol was actually a HTTP/0.9 request with junk data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Excessive CPU Usage:** An attacker can send malformed HTTP requests with missing protocols and a large amount of whitespace or "junk" data after the request line. This causes the server to consume excessive CPU resources while processing the malformed input due to the quadratic complexity of the header probing logic, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Availability Impact:** The primary impact is a high loss of availability of the service due to the excessive CPU consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker sends crafted, malformed HTTP requests to the vulnerable server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
- **Ability to Send Malformed Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests with missing protocols and potentially large amounts of whitespace or junk data following the request line.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
- The issue was introduced in commit `bf618ec7f243cebfb0f7e84c3cb158955cb32b4d` and fixed by commit `79e713f3e527593a45f545e854cd9e6fbb3cd3ed`.
- The fix introduces a limit of 16 extra bytes/whitespaces (`HTTP09_MAX_JUNK_LEN`) after the request line when checking for a missing protocol, preventing quadratic complexity issues.
- The affected versions are libhtp 0.5.46, and the patched version is 0.5.47.
