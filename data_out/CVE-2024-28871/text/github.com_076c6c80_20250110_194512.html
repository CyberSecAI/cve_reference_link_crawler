http0.9: process headers if there are non-space characters

```
Previously, we fell back on HTTP/0.9 if there was a missing protocol
except if the following line cintained a colon.

This makes libhtp stricter to consider a transaction as 0.9
by only accepting if we have spaces after the request line

as done in libhtp-rs

Ticket: 6643
```
