A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used.

The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources.

This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.
