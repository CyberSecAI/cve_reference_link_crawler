- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the SSL-VPN pre-authentication component of FortiOS and FortiProxy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through specifically crafted requests to the SSL-VPN.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable SSL-VPN service. No authentication is required since the issue occurs pre-authentication.
