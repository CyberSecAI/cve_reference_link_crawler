# Squid-2024:4 Multiple issues in ESI

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-f975-v7qw-q7hj
Oct 28, 2024

## Package

squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

3.0-6

## Patched versions

7.0

## Description

Due to Input Validation, Premature Release of Resource During

Expected Lifetime, and Missing Release of Resource after

Effective Lifetime bugs, Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service

attacks by a trusted server against all clients using the proxy.

Vulnerabilities are present in:

* interpreting `<esi:when>`. Original reports:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-when-assert-0.html>
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-when-assert-1.html>
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-nullpointer.html>
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-uaf.html>
* interpreting `<esi:assign>`. Original reports:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-assignassert.html>
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-assignassert-2.html>
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-underflow.html>
* interpreting `<esi:include>`. Original report:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-nullpointer.html>
* interpreting `<esi:try>` and `<esi:choose>`. Original report:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-uaf-crash.html>
* processing errors. Original report:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-memleak.html>
* processing overlong headers. Original report:
  + <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/esi-assert-header.html>

---

Severity:

This problem allows a trusted server to perform a Denial of

Service when processing ESI response content. This effects all

domains being serviced by the proxy and all clients using it

during the affected period.

These issues are limited to Squid acting as reverse proxy where

ESI feature has been enabled at build time.

The ESI feature is enabled in the default configuration in all

Squid versions from 3.0 to 6.9, and disabled in the default

configuration since version 6.10.

---

Updated Packages:

This bug is fixed in the default build configuration of Squid

version 6.10

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Run `squid -v` to determine the version number and build

configuration parameters.

Version 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.0.1 to 6.9 are vulnerable unless the

output contains the text '--disable-esi'.

Versions 6.10 and later are vulnerable if the output contains the

text '--enable-esi'.

---

Workaround:

Build affected Squid with `--disable-esi`.

---

Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
