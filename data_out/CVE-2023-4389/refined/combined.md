| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2219271#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2023-07-03 07:06:32 UTC  ``` An error due to a double decrement of reference count was found in btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in btrfs filesystem in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with user privilege may lead to a system crash or may leak internal kernel information.      In btrfs_get_root_ref(), when btrfs_insert_fs_root() fails, btrfs_put_root() will be called to possibly free the memory area of the variable root. However, this variable is then used again in error handling code after "goto fail", when ret is not -EEXIST.

Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4389>   ``` |  |

```

In btrfs_get_root_ref(), when btrfs_insert_fs_root() fails,
btrfs_put_root() will be called to possibly free the memory area of
the variable root. However, this variable is then used again in error
handling code after "goto fail", when ret is not -EEXIST.

To fix this possible bug, btrfs_put_root() is only called when ret is
-EEXIST for "goto again".

I think this fix is correct, though it's not that clear. If you look how
the code changed, there was the unconditional put and then followed by a
free:

8c38938c7bb0 ("btrfs: move the root freeing stuff into btrfs_put_root")

Here it's putting twice where one will be the final free.

And then the whole refcounting gets updated in

4785e24fa5d2 ("btrfs: don't take an extra root ref at allocation time")

which could be removing the wrong put, I'm not yet sure.

```

Thanks for the reply!

I think the bug should be introduced by this commit:
bc44d7c4b2b1 ("btrfs: push btrfs_grab_fs_root into btrfs_get_fs_root")

This commit has a change:
      ret = btrfs_insert_fs_root(fs_info, root);
      if (ret) {
+      btrfs_put_fs_root(root);
          if (ret == -EEXIST) {
              btrfs_free_fs_root(root);
              goto again;
          }

I could add a Fixes tag of this commit in my V2 patch.
Is it okay?

Best wishes,
Jia-Ju Bai

I can add it myself, that's a minor thing. The fix is correct, I've
rewritten the changelog a bit, patch now added to misc-next, thanks.

Nevermind.  I've just seen a) how old this thread is and b) the commit
subject was changed and subsequently committed as:

168a2f776b976 ("btrfs: fix root ref counts in error handling in btrfs_get_root_ref")

```
