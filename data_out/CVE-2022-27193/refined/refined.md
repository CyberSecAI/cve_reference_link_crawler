- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XXE (XML External Entities) vulnerability exists in the CVRF-CSAF-Converter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the processing of XML input files, where external entities are not properly sanitized, allowing for inclusion of arbitrary local file content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose information from the system running the converter by using specially crafted XML input files. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing malicious XML input files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted XML input files to the converter.
