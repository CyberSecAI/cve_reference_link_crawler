Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `nopeople` parameter in the `book-boat.php` page of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`nopeople` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify, delete, or extract sensitive data from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive information such as user credentials, booking details, or financial data could be exposed.
*   **Application Compromise:**  In severe cases, the application and server itself could be compromised, potentially allowing for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request targeting the `book-boat.php` page and manipulates the `nopeople` parameter to include malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `book-boat.php` page. This implies that the attacker must have network access to the application, which can be either local or remote, depending on how the application is deployed.
*   The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to construct a malicious payload that targets the underlying database.

**Additional Details from VulDB:**
*   The vulnerability was submitted by user `jadu101`.
*   The submission was on 10/17/2024 and moderated on 10/18/2024.
*   VulDB ID is 280939.
*   The vulnerable page is `book-boat.php?bid=1`.
