Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Apache Lucene based query engine in Polarion ALM lacks proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the failure to properly restrict access based on user permissions when querying data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated user can query and potentially view items (data) from projects they are not authorized to access. This constitutes an unauthorized disclosure of information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Polarion ALM to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account and be logged into the Polarion ALM system.
*   **No special privileges:** No further privileges beyond normal user permissions are required.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass access controls in the query engine of Polarion ALM and gain unauthorized access to project data they shouldn't normally be able to view.
