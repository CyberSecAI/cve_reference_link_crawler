Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-30957:

**CVE-2022-30957**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SSH Plugin lacks a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate credentials IDs stored in Jenkins, which could be used in other attacks to capture the credentials.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via HTTP requests to a vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The SSH Plugin versions 2.6.1 and earlier do not properly check permissions in an HTTP endpoint. This allows users with Overall/Read permission to discover the IDs of credentials stored within Jenkins. This ID enumeration can then be used as part of a larger attack aimed at capturing the credentials using a separate vulnerability. There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory.
