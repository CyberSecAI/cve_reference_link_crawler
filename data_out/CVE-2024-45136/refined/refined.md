- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows the upload of files with dangerous types without proper restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the upload of a malicious file, which may be initiated by user interaction. The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system on which InCopy is running or to trick the victim into uploading the file through a crafted workflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the vulnerable application. The user interaction (UI:R) means that the attacker needs a victim to interact with the malicious upload somehow, which might include opening a malicious file that was placed in a specific location or clicking on a crafted button/link inside the application that initiates the upload. The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
