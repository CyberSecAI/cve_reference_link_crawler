- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within Maxon Cinema 4D. Specifically, the issue arises from a lack of proper validation of object existence before performing operations on those objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability due to missing object existence validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious SKP file or visiting a malicious page containing a malicious SKP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file. User interaction is required, meaning the target user must open the crafted malicious file or visit a page that triggers the vulnerability.
