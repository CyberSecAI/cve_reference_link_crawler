Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `include` function in the `reservation-form-template.php` file of the WPCafe plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses user-supplied data from the `reservation_extra_field` shortcode parameter without proper sanitization to determine the file to include.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion, where an attacker can specify a path to a file on the server's filesystem to be included by the PHP `include` function. This vulnerability occurs because the value of `$result_data['reservation_extra_field']` is not validated or sanitized before being used in the `include` statement.
*  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The vulnerability allows inclusion of remote files, likely through methods such as using a URL as a file path. This is a specific type of LFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute commands or scripts on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially include other files on the server, leading to information disclosure and potential compromise of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `reservation_extra_field` parameter within the `[wpcafe_reservation]` shortcode. An attacker can manipulate the value of this parameter to specify a path to a malicious file or a remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level permissions. This means they must be able to create or edit posts or pages that can include the `[wpcafe_reservation]` shortcode.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker must be able to utilize shortcodes within the WordPress content editor to inject the malicious parameter.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided Wordfence content mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in version 2.2.26 of the plugin.
* The vulnerable code is located in `/core/shortcodes/views/reservation/reservation-form-template.php` specifically line 178: `include $result_data['reservation_extra_field'];`

This vulnerability is classified as high severity because it allows a relatively low-privileged user to potentially gain full control of the server.
