- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP User Manager plugin (versions <= 2.9.10) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact will vary case-by-case depending on the actions the user is tricked into performing.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes a request to the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the victim to be authenticated to the target website, and the attacker must be able to convince the victim to execute an action (e.g., click a link).
