- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability exists in Open5GS, which allows an attacker to intercept communications between Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of secure communication between VNFs, enabling an attacker to eavesdrop on the traffic. This is categorized as CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can intercept VNF communications, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, specifically a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept communications between VNFs. No specific privileges are required.
