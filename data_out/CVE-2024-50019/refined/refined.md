- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The kernel attempts to unpark a kthread unconditionally during the stopping process, even if it's already unparked. This leads to a race condition where a per-CPU kthread's wake-up is followed by `kthread_bind()`. `kthread_bind()` expects the task to be in `TASK_PARKED` state but if the kthread is already unparked, this expectation fails, triggering a warning.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition due to unconditional unparking, leading to an incorrect state for the kthread when `kthread_bind()` is called.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability doesn't lead to a crash or data corruption but does trigger a warning, indicating a state inconsistency,  This can lead to unpredictable behavior in the long run and potential security problems, though not directly observable from the current description.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a per-CPU kthread is stopped and its unparking is attempted while it is not in a parked state.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to trigger the stop of a per-CPU kthread that is not in the `TASK_PARKED` state. This requires some control over kernel operations, such as stopping workqueues associated with network devices like wireguard, which are done as part of a shutdown sequence.
