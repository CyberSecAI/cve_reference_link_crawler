### CVE-2024-2539

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied `_id` attributes within the Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses the injected page, the malicious scripts will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the `_id` attribute of a widget.
- This injected code is stored in the database.
- When a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable widget, the injected script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit pages/widgets to inject the malicious script.
