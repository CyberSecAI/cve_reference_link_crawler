{
  "CVE-2022-23559": {
    "Description": "An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in heap OOB read/write.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` due to multiplication of user-provided dimensions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Heap out-of-bounds read/write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious TFLite model with specific dimension values that cause integer overflows.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create or modify TFLite models and load them in the vulnerable environment."
