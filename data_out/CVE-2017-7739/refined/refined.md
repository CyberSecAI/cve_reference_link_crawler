Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of sanitization of the proxy URL in the web proxy disclaimer response pages within FortiOS. This allows for the injection of malicious code into the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is specifically a reflected XSS issue, where malicious JavaScript code embedded in a URL is executed when a user visits that URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of unauthorized code or commands: Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This code can potentially perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Defacing the webpage
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious sites
    - Performing other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URL: An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code. This URL is then sent to the victim through various means, such as email, social media, or compromised websites.
- Victim's browser: When the victim visits the malicious URL, the embedded JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to send/distribute malicious URL: The attacker needs to be able to send or trick the victim into opening the crafted URL.
