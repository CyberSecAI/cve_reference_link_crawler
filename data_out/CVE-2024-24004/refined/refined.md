Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24004

**Affected Product:** jshERP v3.3

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
The `findInOutDetail()` function in `com.jsh.erp.controller.DepotHeadController` does not properly filter the `column` and `order` parameters. The application attempts to sanitize SQL queries using the `safeSqlParse` method, but this method can be bypassed by crafting specific malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input for the `column` and `order` parameters before using them in SQL queries.
*   **Bypassable SQL Filtering:** The `safeSqlParse` method, which is intended to prevent SQL injection, can be bypassed through techniques like double encoding or other variations. Specifically, the provided example uses `a andnd s selectelect` to bypass the filter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to:
*   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
*   Data modification: Modifying or deleting existing data.
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Causing the database to become unavailable by executing resource-intensive queries (as indicated by the `sleep()` function in the exploit examples).
*   Potential Remote Code Execution (depending on the database permissions and underlying system).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates that the vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted GET requests to specific endpoints of the application such as `/jshERP-boot/material/getListWithStock`,  `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutDetail`, `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutMaterialCount`, `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findAllocationDetail`.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** The `column` and `order` parameters are the primary attack vectors for injecting malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.
*   **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to understand the application's API and how to send requests that include the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Ability to Craft SQL Payloads:** The attacker needs the ability to craft SQL payloads that can bypass the application's filtering mechanisms.

**Additional Information:**

The provided content also describes a file upload vulnerability, but that is unrelated to CVE-2024-24004.
The issue #99 on github describes both SQL Injection and file upload vulnerability. The content from `/cxcxcxcxcxcxcxc/cxcxcxcxcxcxcxc/blob/main/cxcxcxcxcxc/about-2024/24004.txt` specifically focuses on SQL injection.
