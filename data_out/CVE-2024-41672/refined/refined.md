Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41672:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `sniff_csv` function in DuckDB was not respecting the `enable_external_access` configuration setting. Even when external access was disabled, `sniff_csv` could still access and read files from the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Bypass of access control:** The `sniff_csv` function was bypassing the intended restriction set by `enable_external_access=false`.
- **Information Disclosure:** Ability to read contents of arbitrary files that should otherwise be protected.
- **Incorrect function behavior**: The `sniff_csv` function was reading file contents, even though it is intended to only provide information about the shape of the data, not the data itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to sensitive information from the filesystem, such as environment variables, configuration files, and other system data. This could lead to further exploitation and privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can use the `sniff_csv` function with a path to a file on the system to read its contents. This is done through SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable DuckDB instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a pentest.
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0.0 and is fixed in 1.1.0.
- The workaround is to disable the `LocalFileSystem` using the `disabled_filesystems` setting.
- The fix involves disabling `sniff_csv` when `enable_external_access` is not set, as shown in the code changes.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #13133.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-41672.
