### Buttercup for Desktop

##### macOS, Linux, Windows

Buttercup for desktop is a beautifully-simple password manager designed to help manage your credentials. Buttercup uses very strong encryption to protect your sensitive details under a single master password - Feel free to use stronger and more complex passwords for each service and let Buttercup store them securely.

Buttercup is free to download and use and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Use it alongside the browser extension and mobile app for a completely portable experience.

Alternatively, using Homebrew: `$ brew install --cask buttercup`
Latest: . [Releases Page](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases).

### Buttercup for Mobile

##### iOS, Android

Take your login credentials wherever you go by installing the free iOS or Android app on your phone. Buttercup mobile gives you access to the same vaults you use on the desktop application and browser extension, so your newly added details can be seen on all of your devices.

Buttercup’s mobile applications employ similar safety techniques to banking applications, such as auto-lock and a security overlay when the app is minimized.

Note: the extension **requires the Buttercup desktop application version 2.26 or later** be installed *and* running, at least in the background. This browser addon uses an encrypted connection with the desktop application to transfer vault credentials during login and saving. This addon cannot function without the desktop application.
