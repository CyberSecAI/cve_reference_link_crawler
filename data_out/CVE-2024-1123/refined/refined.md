### CVE-2024-1123
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-1123.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `save_frontend_event_submission()` function within the EventPrime plugin. This function allows users to modify post content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `save_frontend_event_submission()` function lacks proper capability checks.
- **Arbitrary Post Overwrite:** Authenticated users, including subscribers, and potentially unauthenticated users when anonymous submissions are enabled can modify the title and content of arbitrary posts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can overwrite the content of any post on the WordPress site.
- This could lead to defacement of the site, injection of malicious content, or other forms of manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Authenticated Attackers:** Logged-in users with subscriber-level access or higher.
- **Unauthenticated Attackers:** If the `allow_submission_by_anonymous_user` setting is enabled, the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access or be unauthenticated if the corresponding setting is enabled.
- They also need to be able to access the vulnerable `save_frontend_event_submission()` function.
