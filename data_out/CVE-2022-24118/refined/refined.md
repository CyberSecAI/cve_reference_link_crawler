The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24118.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to use an authentication code to force a radio device to reset to its factory default configuration and reboot. This is due to the use of an authentication code to trigger a factory reset function, which should require more robust controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The system does not properly control how many resources are consumed when a specific authentication code is used, which can lead to a factory reset being triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in the device being reset to its factory default configuration and rebooted, causing a denial of service.
- Configuration data and potentially other critical settings can be lost if there is no backup functionality in place.
- This disruption can impact communications, critical processes, and overall system reliability, depending on the function of the device and how it is being used in operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent to the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be adjacent to the targeted system.
- The attacker does not require any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this.
- The attacker must be able to send the specific authentication code.
