### Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3730. It describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Simple Membership plugin for WordPress, specifically within the `swpm_paypal_subscription_cancel_link` shortcode.

**Vulnerability Details:**
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes in the `swpm_paypal_subscription_cancel_link` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses:**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input passed to the shortcode and subsequently fails to escape the output where the shortcode is rendered. This allows the injection of malicious web scripts.
- **Impact:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the page containing the injected shortcode.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode using the `swpm_paypal_subscription_cancel_link` shortcode with malicious JavaScript embedded in the shortcode parameters and adds that shortcode in a page or post content.
- **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access. This level of access allows the user to create and edit pages and posts and add shortcodes.
- **Affected Versions:** Simple Membership plugin versions up to and including 4.4.3 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.4.4.

**Additional Details from the Changelog:**
The provided changelog from the plugin's readme.txt file indicates that version 4.4.4 includes the following fix:
