{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the fribidi library.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing conditional check for the length of a string before accessing a pointer. Specifically, the code attempts to access `S_[len - 1]` without verifying that `len` is greater than 0. If `strlen()` returns 0, `len - 1` results in a negative index, leading to a stack buffer underflow.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Missing input validation"
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input file, leading to a memory leak, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to provide the crafted file to the vulnerable application running on the system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted file as input to the fribidi application.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer. The issue occurs in the main function of fribidi-main.c. The vulnerable code accesses memory using a length obtained from strlen, which could return zero, leading to an out-of-bounds access on the stack."
  },
  "affected_component": {
    "name": "fribidi library",
    "version": "v1.0.11 and earlier"
  },
  "remediation": {
        "recommendation": "The vulnerability was addressed by adding a conditional check to ensure that the length of the string is greater than 0 before attempting to access the pointer with a calculated index.",
        "patch_details": "The fix involved adding a check `if (len > 0)` before the line accessing `S_[len - 1]`."
