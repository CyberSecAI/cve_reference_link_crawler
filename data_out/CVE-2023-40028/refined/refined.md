Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to upload files containing symlinks. The application does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing malicious users to include symlinks in the uploaded content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of symlinks into the application's content directory.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** By crafting malicious ZIP files containing symlinks that point to sensitive files outside the intended content directory, attackers can read the content of these files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application lacks proper validation of uploaded file content, specifically failing to prevent the inclusion of symlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** This vulnerability does not allow for the modification of data (integrity) or affect the system's operational availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely over a network connection.
- **File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted ZIP archive that contains symlinks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Ghost application.
- **Upload Capabilities:** The attacker must have the privilege to upload files to the Ghost application.
- **Craft Malicious Zip File:** The attacker needs to be able to create a zip file with symlinks that target files they wish to read.
