# Arbitrary file read via symlinks in content import

Moderate

[daniellockyer](/daniellockyer)
published
GHSA-9c9v-w225-v5rg
Aug 15, 2023

## Package

npm

ghost
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

≤ 5.59.0

## Patched versions

5.59.1

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in Ghost allows authenticated users to upload files which are symlinks. This can be exploited to perform an arbitrary file read of any file on the operating system.

Site administrators can check for exploitation of this issue by looking for unknown symlinks within Ghost's `content/` folder

### Vulnerable versions

This security vulnerability is present in Ghost ≤ v5.59.0.

### Patches

v5.59.1 contains a fix for this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Email us at security@ghost.org

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-40028
