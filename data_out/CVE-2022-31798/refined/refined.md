Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of local session fixation and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local Session Fixation:** The application does not properly invalidate or regenerate session IDs, allowing an attacker to potentially fix a user's session ID.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `card_scan.php` script is vulnerable to reflected XSS, as it doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `No`, `ReaderNo`, and `CardFormatNo` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to account takeover of admin or less privileged users. By fixing a session and then using XSS to inject malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs that leverage both vulnerabilities. Specifically:
1.  An attacker crafts a URL with specific values in the vulnerable `No`, `ReaderNo`, and `CardFormatNo` parameters of `card_scan.php`, including the malicious JavaScript payload as part of `CardFormatNo`.
2.  The victim clicks on this URL and the script is injected into the page and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious URL to a victim.
*   The victim must click on the malicious URL, either through direct access or social engineering.
*   No prior authentication is required by the attacker before exploiting the vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected product is identified as "Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series" with version `0.32-07p`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting JavaScript via the `CardFormatNo` parameter to perform an `alert(document.location)`. This demonstrates XSS and can be used to redirect a user or send session information to an attacker controlled location.
* The session fixation occurs outside of the XSS itself, it is assumed to be happening in a prior step, making use of a lack of session regeneration/invalidation in the affected product.
