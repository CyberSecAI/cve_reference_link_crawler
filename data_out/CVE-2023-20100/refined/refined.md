- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error occurs during the access point (AP) joining process of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol when certain conditions are met.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the logic of the AP joining process within the CAPWAP protocol implementation in Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to an unexpected restart of the affected device, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by adding a malicious AP to the network, ensuring it joins the controller under specific conditions, and restarting a previously connected valid AP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to add a controlled AP to the network, ensure it successfully joins the targeted controller under certain conditions, and restart a previously connected valid AP.
