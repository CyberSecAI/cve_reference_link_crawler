- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the wireless driver of affected devices, where it doesn't properly validate an information element during a WPA2 four-way handshake.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of an information element during WPA2 handshake.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote execution of arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a low-privileged, close-proximity attacker. The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the device to exploit the issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the device and have a low-privileged position.
