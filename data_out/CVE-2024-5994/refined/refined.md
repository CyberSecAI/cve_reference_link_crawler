Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The WP Go Maps plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "Custom JS" option, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation: The plugin does not sufficiently sanitize or escape user-provided data before embedding it into a web page, resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute within the browsers of users who visit pages containing the map. 
- This can lead to a range of attacks, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacement of the website
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the "Custom JS" setting option within the plugin settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level permissions or above on the WordPress website. This implies the attacker has been explicitly granted these permissions by an administrator.
- No user interaction required besides a user accessing a page where the malicious javascript has been injected
- No special network position is required, it can be done through the admin interface of the website

**Additional Notes:**

- Version 9.0.39 of the plugin includes a warning to administrators to exercise caution when granting access to the plugin's settings to lower-level users due to the potential for abuse.
- The vulnerability is present in both the legacy and Atlas Novus settings pages.
