## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro prior to version 5.0.7 (or 4.2.7 for the 4.x series) contain a vulnerability that allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell` executable running on the server. This causes `aspell` to attempt to load a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename.

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Stefan Schiller ([@stefan-schiller-sonarsource](https://github.com/stefan-schiller-sonarsource)), vulnerability researcher at [SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/). We thank Stefan and Sonar for their responsible disclosure and collaboration in addressing this issue.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The problem is patched in versions 5.0.7 and 4.2.7. Previous versions can be upgraded using the [Overleaf toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) `bin/upgrade` command.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Blocking POST requests to `/spelling/check` via a Web Application Firewall will prevent access to the vulnerable spell check feature. However, upgrading is advised.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*
