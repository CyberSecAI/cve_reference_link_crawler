### Prerequisites

* I have written a descriptive pull-request title
* I have verified that there are no overlapping [pull-requests](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pulls) open
* I have verified that I am following the existing coding patterns and practice as demonstrated in the repository. These follow strict Stylecop rules üëÆ.
* I have provided test coverage for my change (where applicable)

### Description

Fixes [#2758](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/2758)

I cannot include the images in the tests as I was unable to open a FileExplorer instance containing them without crashing in my Windows 11 instance.

Still not sure what's going on with the provided repo, but I have added the relevant test images and tests.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@antonfirsov](https://github.com/antonfirsov) My first attempt was bad as I misunderstood the problem.  I've now refactored the LZW decoder to run row-by-row, so we only allocate enough bytes for a single row rather than the full buffer. In this case this brings down the allocation from 4GB to 64K. This should mean a massive win across the board. |
