# Security Considerations

Image processing is a memory-intensive application. Most image processing libraries (including ImageSharp, SkiaSharp, and Magick.NET) decode images into in-memory buffers for further processing. Without additional measures, any publicly facing service that consumes images coming from untrusted sources might be vulnerable to DoS attacks attempting to deplete process memory.

Such measures can be:

* Authentication, for example by using HMAC. See [Securing Processing Commands in ImageSharp.Web](../imagesharp.web/processingcommands.html#securing-processing-commands).
* Offloading to separate services/containers.
* Placing the solution behind a reverse proxy.
* Rate Limiting.
* Imposing conservative allocation limits by configuring a custom `MemoryAllocator`:

```
Configuration.Default.MemoryAllocator = MemoryAllocator.Create(new MemoryAllocatorOptions()
{
    // Note that this limits the maximum image size to 64 megapixels of Rgba32.
    // Any attempt to create a larger image will throw.
    AllocationLimitMegabytes = 256
});

```
