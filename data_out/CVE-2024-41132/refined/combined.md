# Security Considerations

Image processing is a memory-intensive application. Most image processing libraries (including ImageSharp, SkiaSharp, and Magick.NET) decode images into in-memory buffers for further processing. Without additional measures, any publicly facing service that consumes images coming from untrusted sources might be vulnerable to DoS attacks attempting to deplete process memory.

Such measures can be:

* Authentication, for example by using HMAC. See [Securing Processing Commands in ImageSharp.Web](../imagesharp.web/processingcommands.html#securing-processing-commands).
* Offloading to separate services/containers.
* Placing the solution behind a reverse proxy.
* Rate Limiting.
* Imposing conservative allocation limits by configuring a custom `MemoryAllocator`:

```
Configuration.Default.MemoryAllocator = MemoryAllocator.Create(new MemoryAllocatorOptions()
{
    // Note that this limits the maximum image size to 64 megapixels of Rgba32.
    // Any attempt to create a larger image will throw.
    AllocationLimitMegabytes = 256
});

```

# Processing Commands

The ImageSharp.Web processing API is imperative. This means that the order in which you supply the individual processing operations is the order in which they are compiled and applied. This allows the API to be very flexible, allowing you to combine processes in any order.

##### Note

It is possible to configure your own processing command pipeline by implementing and registering your own version of the [IRequestParser](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.Commands.IRequestParser.html) interface.

The following processors are built into the middleware. In addition extension points are available to register your own command processors.

#### Resize

Allows the resizing of images.

##### Note

In V3 this processor will automatically correct the order of dimensional commands based on the presence of EXIF metadata indicating rotated (not flipped) images.
This behavior can be turned off per request.

```
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?width=300
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?width=300&height=120&rxy=0.37,0.78
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?width=50&height=50&rsampler=nearest&rmode=stretch
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?width=300&compand=true&orient=false

```

Resize commands represent the [ResizeOptions](../../api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.ResizeOptions.html) class.

* `width` The width of the image in px. Use only one dimension to preseve the aspect ratio.
* `height` The height of the image in px. Use only one dimension to preseve the aspect ratio.
* `rmode` The [ResizeMode](../../api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.ResizeMode.html) to use.
* `rsampler` The [IResampler](../../api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Processors.Transforms.IResampler.html)

* `orient` Whether to swap command dimensions based on the presence of EXIF metadata indicating rotated (not flipped) images. Defaults to `true`
* `compand` Whether to compress and expand individual pixel colors values to/from a linear color space when processing. Defaults to `false`

#### Format

Allows the encoding of the output image to a new image format. The available formats depend on your configuration settings.

```
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=bmp
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=gif
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=jpg
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=pbm
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=png
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=tga
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=tiff
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=webp

```
#### Quality

Allows the encoding of the output image at the given quality.

* For Jpeg this ranges from 1—100.
* For WebP this ranges from 1—100.

```
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?quality=90
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?format=jpg&quality=42

```
##### Note

Only certain formats support adjustable quality. This is a constraint of individual image standards not the API.

#### Background Color

Allows the changing of the background color of transparent images.

```
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?bgcolor=FFFF00
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?bgcolor=C1FF0080
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?bgcolor=red
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?bgcolor=128,64,32
{PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE}?bgcolor=128,64,32,16

```
## Securing Processing Commands

With ImageSharp.Web it is possible to configure an action to generate an HMAC by setting the [HMACSecretKey](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.Middleware.ImageSharpMiddlewareOptions.html#SixLabors_ImageSharp_Web_Middleware_ImageSharpMiddlewareOptions_HMACSecretKey) property to any byte array value. This triggers checks in the middleware to look for and compare a HMAC hash of the request URL with the hash that is passed alongside the commands.

In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and authenticity of a message.

HMAC can provide authentication using a shared secret instead of using digital signatures with asymmetric cryptography. It trades off the need for a complex public key infrastructure by delegating the key exchange to the communicating parties, who are responsible for establishing and using a trusted channel to agree on the key prior to communication.

Any cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-2 or SHA-3, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X, where X is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3-512). The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.

HMAC does not encrypt the message. Instead, the message (encrypted or not) must be sent alongside the HMAC hash. Parties with the secret key will hash the message again themselves, and if it is authentic, the received and computed hashes will match.

By default ImageSharp.Web will use a HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.

```
private Func<ImageCommandContext, byte[], Task<string>> onComputeHMACAsync = (context, secret) =>
{
    string uri = CaseHandlingUriBuilder.BuildRelative(
            CaseHandlingUriBuilder.CaseHandling.LowerInvariant,
            context.Context.Request.PathBase,
            context.Context.Request.Path,
            QueryString.Create(context.Commands));

    return Task.FromResult(HMACUtilities.ComputeHMACSHA256(uri, secret));
};

```

Users can replicate that key using the same [CaseHandlingUriBuilder](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.CaseHandlingUriBuilder.html) and [HMACUtilities](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.HMACUtilities.html) APIs to generate the HMAC hash on the client. The hash must be passed via a command using the [TokenCommand](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.HMACUtilities.html#SixLabors_ImageSharp_Web_HMACUtilities_TokenCommand) constant.

Any invalid matches are rejected at the very start of the processing pipeline with a 400 HttpResponse code.

## ImageTagHelper

ASP.NET tag helpers are useful because they provide a more natural syntax for creating HTML elements in server-side code. They allow developers to create HTML elements in a way that is similar to how they would write HTML markup in a Razor view.

Some of the benefits of using tag helpers include:

1. Improved readability: Tag helpers make it easier to understand the purpose of the code by providing a clear and concise syntax that is closer to HTML.
2. Reduced complexity: Tag helpers simplify the creation of complex HTML elements by reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed.
3. Type safety: Tag helpers are strongly typed, which means that the compiler can catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
4. Testability: Tag helpers make it easier to unit test server-side code by providing a cleaner separation of concerns between the server-side code and the HTML markup.
5. Code reuse: Tag helpers can be used to encapsulate commonly used HTML elements, making it easier to reuse code across multiple views and pages.

Overall, ASP.NET tag helpers provide a more efficient and maintainable way to create HTML elements in server-side code.

ImageSharp.Web v3.0.0 comes equipped with a custom tag helper that allows the generation of all the commands supported by the middleware in an easily accessible manner. This includes automatic generation of HMAC command tokens.

##### Note

Using [ImageTagHelper](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.TagHelpers.ImageTagHelper.html) is the recommended way to generate processing commands.

To use [ImageTagHelper](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.TagHelpers.ImageTagHelper.html), add the following imports command to `_ViewImports.cshtml` in your project.

```
@addTagHelper *, SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web

```

All ImageSharp.Web commands are strongly typed and prefixed with `imagesharp` to namespace them against potentially conflicting commands. Visual Studio intellisense with automatically provide guidance
once you start typing. For example, the following markup...

```
<img
    src="sixlabors.imagesharp.web.png"
    imagesharp-width="300"
    imagesharp-height="200"
    imagesharp-rmode="ResizeMode.Pad"
    imagesharp-rcolor="Color.LimeGreen" />

```

Will generate the following command when HMAC is enabled.

```
/sixlabors.imagesharp.web.png?width=300&height=200&rmode=Pad&rcolor=32CD32FF&hmac=21f93e41021df0d3f88b5e2a8753bb273f292598e1511df67ec7cfb63f0b2994

```

The [ImageTagHelper](../../api/ImageSharp.Web/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.TagHelpers.ImageTagHelper.html) type is unsealed so that you can inherit the type and support your own custom commands.

* I have provided test coverage for my change (where applicable)

### Description

Implemented it by a full port of 3.1.x Gif Decoder, so it contains improvements and behavioral changes made since then. It also decodes some stuff 2.1 API doesn't expose.

I didn't fully understand what was the JPEG change about, but the 2.1 decoder detects it as an invalid image. Added the test as a skipped test.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for doing this!

I think incorporating the full decoder was probably wise here. There were likely other critical issues missed over time that should be included.

The jpeg issue in v3.1.x was that the chrominance quality was being determined as zero. This led to the encoder trying to divide by that value. I'm fine with decoder throwing an exception here.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Description

Fixes [#2758](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/2758)

I cannot include the images in the tests as I was unable to open a FileExplorer instance containing them without crashing in my Windows 11 instance.

Still not sure what's going on with the provided repo, but I have added the relevant test images and tests.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@antonfirsov](https://github.com/antonfirsov) My first attempt was bad as I misunderstood the problem.  I've now refactored the LZW decoder to run row-by-row, so we only allocate enough bytes for a single row rather than the full buffer. In this case this brings down the allocation from 4GB to 64K. This should mean a massive win across the board. |

([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

< 2.1.9
< 3.1.5

## Patched versions

2.1.9
3.1.5

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in the Gif decoder. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit this flaw.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The problem has been patched. All users are advised to upgrade to v3.1.5 or v2.1.9.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Before calling `Image.Decode(Async)`, use `Image.Identify` to determine the image dimensions in order to enforce a limit.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
