The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Semcms v4.8, specifically within the `SEMCMS_Banner.php` file.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `ID` and `lgid` parameters within the `SEMCMS_Banner.php` script. These parameters are directly incorporated into a SQL query without sufficient filtering, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The provided `inject_check_sql` function attempts to filter out malicious SQL keywords but can be bypassed, which is ineffective against more advanced injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Unauthorized Access:  The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring an account, granting unauthenticated attackers access to database information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Parameters: The attack vector is through the `ID` and potentially `lgid` parameters in the HTTP GET request to `SEMCMS_Banner.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is needed to craft the malicious payload.
