Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `animalsupdate.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-supplied input for the `id` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL queries without adequate sanitization or escaping, creating an avenue for SQL injection attacks.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate or filter user input to ensure it adheres to expected formats. This allows malicious SQL code to be included in the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:**  Potentially, the attacker could achieve full control over the system by exploiting the SQL injection.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attack can disrupt the availability of the application or services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `animalsupdate.php` file.
*   The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in a POST request to `animalsupdate.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `animalsupdate.php` file with malicious SQL code embedded in the `id` parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) payloads demonstrate how an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
*   The issue was discovered by `polaris0x1`.
*   The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the "Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code".

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering to sanitize user input data.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.
