Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `$DELETE_STR` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application performs some basic filtering, but this filtering is inadequate and easily bypassed, as it seems to only detect common keywords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database through blind SQL injection, as demonstrated in the provided examples by obtaining the database name.
- **Data Manipulation:** It might be possible for an attacker to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Full database compromise**: While not explicitly demonstrated, full database compromise is a potential impact through further exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `DELETE_STR` parameter in an HTTP request to the `/general/email/outbox/delete.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.
- **No authentication required**: Based on the provided information, it is implied that no authentication is required to exploit this SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific type of SQL injection being used is a time-based blind injection. The attacker uses the time delay caused by certain SQL queries to infer information about the database, bit by bit.
- The provided content includes examples of crafted payloads which use `substr()` and `char()` SQL functions with a time delay to identify the database name characters using ASCII values.
- The vulnerable application is Tongda OA v2017 and versions below 11.10
