Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of resource limits or throttling in the Zabbix server's browser item script functionality. Specifically, the `browser_perf.c` file (identified in the details) allows an attacker to allocate excessive resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-770):** The core weakness is the absence of proper limits on resource allocation, allowing an attacker to exhaust server resources like CPU and memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause the Zabbix server to crash by exhausting resources which can result in a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Even without a full crash, excessive resource consumption can significantly degrade the performance of the Zabbix server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Browser Item Script:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Zabbix server's browser item script functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, since it is marked with AV:N in CVSS vector.
*   **No Special Privileges Needed:** As indicated by PR:N in the CVSS vector, no special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a previous issue, CVE-2023-29449, specifically the code in `src/libs/zbxembed/browser_perf.c`.
*   The issue was reported through HackerOne by justonezero
*   The vulnerability affects Zabbix versions 7.0.0 and is fixed in 7.0.1rc1 and 7.2.0alpha1.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5 with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be used as part of a DDoS attack, by crashing the server
