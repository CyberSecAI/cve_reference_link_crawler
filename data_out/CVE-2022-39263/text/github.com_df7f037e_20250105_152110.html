# Missing token verification in Upstash Adapter

Moderate

[ThangHuuVu](/ThangHuuVu)
published
GHSA-4rxr-27mm-mxq9
Sep 28, 2022

## Package

npm

@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.2

## Patched versions

v3.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected.

### Description

The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration.

### Patches

The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2.

To upgrade, run one of the following:

```
npm i @next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter@latest

```

```
yarn add @next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter@latest

```

```
pnpm add @next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter@latest

```
### Workarounds

Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. Below is an example of how to do this: (Upgrading is still strongly recommended)

```
import { createHash } from "crypto"
export default async function auth(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST" && req.action === "callback") {
    const token = req.query?.token
    const identifier = req.query?.email
    function hashToken(token: string) {
      const provider = authOptions.providers.find((p) => p.id === "email")
      const secret = authOptions.secret
      return (
        createHash("sha256")
          // Prefer provider specific secret, but use default secret if none specified
          .update(`${token}${provider.secret ?? secret}`)
          .digest("hex")
      )
    }
    const hashedToken = hashToken(token)

    const invite = await authOptions.adapter.useVerificationToken?.({
      identifier,
      token: hashedToken,
    })
    if (invite.token !== hashedToken) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid token" })
    }
  }
  return await NextAuth(req, res, authOptions)
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
