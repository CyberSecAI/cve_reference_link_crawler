- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Active Products Tables for WooCommerce" is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection. This is due to the plugin's handling of user-supplied data, specifically when deserializing PHP objects.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control serialized PHP objects, which when unserialized by vulnerable code can lead to execution of arbitrary code, SQL injection, path traversal, or denial of service.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, SQL injection, path traversal, or denial of service. The specific impact depends on the presence of a suitable "POP chain" within the application.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker. It is likely exploited by sending a crafted serialized PHP object to the vulnerable plugin, which when processed results in the execution of malicious code.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
