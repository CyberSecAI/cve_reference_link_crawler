The provided content is related to CVE-2023-3435.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape several parameters before using them in a SQL statement as part of its exportation feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLi). The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input parameters used in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `admin-post.php` endpoint with malicious SQL payloads in the `userrole`, `username`, `type`, `txtsearch`, or `showip` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Initially, the vulnerability was unauthenticated, meaning an attacker didn't need any specific role or authentication. However, version 1.6.4 patched this for unauthenticated users, but the vulnerability was still exploitable by users with "Subscriber" role or higher.
