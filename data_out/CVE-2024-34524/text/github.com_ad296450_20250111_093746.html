| Hi, When I try the product, I find that it is easy to bypass the file type restriction on the uploading functionality. The issue is CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File  You could rename any file with the extension types presented in [here](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/blob/880e26adfe380e999962fc645fc8fc80bd72f103/backend/utils/utils.py#L31) to bypass the limitation. Only checking extension suffix in the filename is not enough, using magic number to check would be a better approach.  Thanks for your time reading. |
