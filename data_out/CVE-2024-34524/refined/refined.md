The provided content is related to CVE-2024-34524.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file types during the upload process. The application relies solely on the file extension to determine the type of the uploaded file, without performing additional checks like examining the magic number or file signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-646:** Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File. The system trusts the file extension to determine the file type.
- **File Upload Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the file type restrictions by simply renaming a malicious file with an allowed extension.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can upload files with malicious content disguised as allowed file types (e.g., a malicious script renamed with a `.csv` extension).
- This could lead to various attacks such as code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a file with a malicious payload with an allowed extension.
- The vulnerability is located in the `allowed_file` function which only checks the file extension against a list of allowed extensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files to the application.
- Knowledge of allowed file extensions.
