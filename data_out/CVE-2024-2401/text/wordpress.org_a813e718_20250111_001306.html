## Description

Editing pages in WordPress is too slow. You spend hours going back and forth to the backend dashboard, finding pages to edit, going into your page editor of choice be it Gutenberg, Elementor or whatever else, saving and then repeating the entire process in backwards just to view the page!

No more!

Admin Page Spider makes working in WordPress infinitely more sensible.

You get a menu of all your pages & posts right in your WordPress Admin Bar. Now you can jump to any of your content to start working on it, without having to bounce around wasting time for pages to load.

Ultra-lightweight, this plugin increases your development speed without any impact to customers, saving hours of time clicking & waiting unnecssarily.

See the [screenshots tab](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-page-spider/screenshots/) for more details.

Actual tests show almost a 40% time saving in the time it takes to work and build your website – especially if you’re using a builder, or css tool or have multiple pages, products like an ecommerce store, or simply a lot of pages or blog articles.

## Installation

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

Unzip the archive and put the admin-page-spider folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).

Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

#### Usage

In your dashboard go to the Settings -> Admin Page Spider. Set the desired menus to ‘Display’ and hit save. Most settings are enabled by default when you activate the plugin.

#### More Support

The Free Version only supports Pages and Posts, but with the premium version, you get a TON more features! Connect to any post type that you’re using and open up a page directly in that tool.

For example you could see a nice convenient list of all your woocommerce products. Or you could see all your Pods and ACF setups with a glance. Or open a page directly in Elementor. It truly becomes powerful when you combine this with third party plugin support.

I really should have found this tool earlier. Works really well. Saves me a lot of clicks.
A must have tool for wordpress admins and SEOs.

Not only is this plugin a true gem, the support is outstanding. I recommend upgrading to the pro version, it is absolutely worth it!

I’ve been using this plugin with BB for years and having always got it directly from the developer’s site it never dawned on me to come to the repo and leave a review. If I could give this plugin more stars I would. If you’re not using this plugin you have no idea how much time you are losing in unnecessary clicks. It is just the best little plugin out there. I’d highly recommend the pro version not only because of the extra options it offers but because the developer deserves to get paid for this bundle of awesomeness. In case I hadn’t made it clear, I dearly love this plugin. Building without it is painful.

really great plugin. Every click is 1 too many, so this is just a necessity

For developing or updating your website, you need this plugin. It saves time and clicks. Works great with Beaver Builder. It is always the first plugin I install.

This is a super convenient plugin when you want instant access to any page made with Beaver Builder, Divi, Elementor, Oxygen, Custom post types or any Wordpress Post or Page. I couldn’t work without it. The price for the Pro version is very reasonable and the support is top notch. Great plugin!
