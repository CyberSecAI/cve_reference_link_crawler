- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition in the `update_root_in_config` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend, leading to the redirection of user traffic to a malicious server. This can result in the interception of sensitive data, such as authentication credentials or uploaded files.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the race condition in the `update_root_in_config` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Gradio server during the race condition window. This is especially concerning for Gradio servers exposed to the internet.
