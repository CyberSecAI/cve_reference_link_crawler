Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetSysToolDDNS` function of the Tenda AX1803 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formSetSysToolDDNS` function receives user-controlled parameters (`serverName`, `ddnsUser`, `ddnsPwd`, `ddnsDomain`) via a POST request.
- The function uses `strcpy` to copy these parameters into fixed-size stack buffers (`s2`, `v19`, `v18`, `v17`).
- The lack of bounds checking during the copy operation allows an attacker to provide oversized input, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service (DoS), or other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetDDNSCfg` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to control the `serverName`, `ddnsUser`, `ddnsPwd`, or `ddnsDomain` parameters to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This typically implies network access to the device's web interface.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, it's possible that the attack is possible without authentication.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AX1803 V1.0.0.1.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending an oversized `serverName` parameter.
- The vulnerability was submitted to vuldb.com and assigned entry 262127.

This vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking on user-supplied input.
