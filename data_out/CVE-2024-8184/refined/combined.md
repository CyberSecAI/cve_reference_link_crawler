Oct 14, 2024

## Package

maven

org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 12.0.0, <= 12.0.8
>= 10.0.0, <= 10.0.23
>= 11.0.0, <= 11.0.23
>= 9.3.12, <= 9.4.55

## Patched versions

12.0.9
10.0.24
11.0.24

## Description

### Impact

Remote DOS attack can cause out of memory

### Description

There exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's `ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote()` which

can be exploited by unauthorized users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By

repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the

server's memory.

### Affected Versions

* Jetty 12.0.0-12.0.8 (Supported)
* Jetty 11.0.0-11.0.23 (EOL)
* Jetty 10.0.0-10.0.23 (EOL)
* Jetty 9.3.12-9.4.55 (EOL)

### Patched Versions

* Jetty 12.0.9
* Jetty 11.0.24
* Jetty 10.0.24
* Jetty 9.4.56

### Workarounds

Do not use `ThreadLimitHandler`.

Consider use of `QoSHandler` instead to artificially limit resource utilization.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
