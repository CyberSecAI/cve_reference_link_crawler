Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28109:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of secure parameters being set during XSLT transformations when processing user-provided policy files. Specifically, the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` was not enabled, and the `ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET` was not properly restricted. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XSLT code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSLT Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for XSLT injection. By crafting a malicious XSLT file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running veraPDF.
*   **Insecure XSLT Processing:** The lack of secure processing configurations for XSLT transformations opens the door for various attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the possibility of remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the veraPDF application. The provided example shows an attacker executing a `curl` command.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Policy Files:** The attack vector is through user-supplied policy files. When a user uploads a crafted policy file that includes malicious XSLT code, the vulnerability can be triggered during policy validation.
*  **Drag and Drop:** Specifically, the issue occurs when clicking the execution button, where users can drag and drop policy files into the area where a policy file is not chosen.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Upload Policy Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload or provide policy files to the veraPDF application.
*   **Knowledge of XSLT:** The attacker needs knowledge of XSLT to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when applying custom schematron files, not during standard validation checks.
*   The fix involves enabling `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` and setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET` to `file` when creating the TransformerFactory to prevent external stylesheet access.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in veraPDF versions 1.24.2 and later.

The provided files detail the code changes that address the vulnerability by securing the XSLT transformation process across three files: `PolicyChecker.java`, `SchematronPipeline.java`, and `XsltTransformer.java`.
