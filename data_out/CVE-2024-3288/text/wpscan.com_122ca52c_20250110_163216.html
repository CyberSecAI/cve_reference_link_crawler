## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Logo Slider < 4.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its Slider Settings before outputting them back in attributes, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Using a contributor account, add a Logo Slider using the Shortcode Generator menu of the plugin.
2. In the Header tab, use this as title and subtitle: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
3. Submit the Slider for review/save it, the XSS will be triggered when any user will edit the slider again
