- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape slider settings, specifically the title and subtitle, before outputting them into HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the slider settings, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view or edit the slider. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious websites, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the plugin's shortcode generator, a user with Contributor role or higher can inject malicious code into the title and subtitle fields within the Header tab of the slider settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a WordPress user account with at least the Contributor role.
