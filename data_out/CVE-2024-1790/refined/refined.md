Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of the 'type' parameter in the `alm_get_layout` function within the Ajax Load More plugin. This parameter is used to construct file paths, and the plugin fails to adequately prevent path traversal attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The plugin is susceptible to path traversal due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input when constructing file paths. Specifically, the `type` parameter, which is intended to specify a layout template, is not properly checked for relative path components like `./` or `..\`.
- **Insufficient input sanitization:** The plugin uses `sanitize_text_field` on the `type` parameter. However, this function is not sufficient to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities because it does not remove relative path components.
- **File Inclusion/Arbitrary File Read:** By manipulating the `type` parameter, an attacker can potentially specify paths to files outside the intended directories, leading to arbitrary file reads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server. This could include configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive data, leading to a severe compromise of confidentiality.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information disclosure can result in further attacks, such as privilege escalation or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request that includes the vulnerable `type` parameter and a valid nonce.
- **`alm_get_layout` Function:** The vulnerable function is exposed via the `wp_ajax_alm_get_layout` action, allowing for AJAX exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be logged into WordPress with administrator-level access or higher.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is primarily exploitable on Windows servers due to the way Windows handles relative paths. However, the general issue applies to both Windows and Linux.
- The provided files show the fix introduced in version 7.1.0 using the `alm_is_valid_path()` function which aims to prevent directory traversal by checking the path for relative path components.
- The vulnerability existed in versions of the plugin up to and including 7.0.1.
- The fix involves ensuring that paths are validated before being used in `file_get_contents()` operations. The `alm_is_valid_path()` function checks for occurrences of `./` and `.\` in the path.
