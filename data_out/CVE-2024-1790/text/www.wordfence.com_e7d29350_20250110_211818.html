### Description

The WordPress Infinite Scroll – Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.1 via the 'type' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. This is limited to Windows instances.
