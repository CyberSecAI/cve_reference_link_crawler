  "CVE-2024-45037": {
    "description": "The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. If a CDK application uses the \"RestApi\" construct with \"CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer\" as the authorizer and uses authorization scopes to limit access, authenticated Cognito users may gain unintended access to protected API resources or methods, leading to potential data disclosure, and modification issues.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how the `AuthorizationType` was being determined within the `RestApi` construct when using a `CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer`. The system was not correctly applying authorization scopes when an authorization type was not explicitly defined in the method or root API, resulting in broader access than intended.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect authorization scope enforcement",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated Cognito users may gain unintended access to protected API resources or methods, potentially leading to data disclosure and modification.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the affected API endpoints",
      "Exploitation of misconfigured authorization scopes"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Cognito User Pool. No special privileges beyond a regular authenticated user are required."
