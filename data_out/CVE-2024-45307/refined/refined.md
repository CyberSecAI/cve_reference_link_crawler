The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `-config` command of the `sudobot`. This allows any user, regardless of their permissions, to execute the command and modify the bot's configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper authorization: The `-config` command lacks a check to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., those with `ManageGuild` permissions) can execute it.
- Privilege escalation: Unauthorized users can modify the bot's configuration, potentially gaining control over the bot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain control over the bot's settings by modifying the configuration.
-  The bot's functionality can be altered by changing configuration values.
-  Potential for other attacks depending on how the bot's configuration is utilized.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to interact with the bot via the `-config` command.

**Additional information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.26.7 of the bot. Users are advised to update to this version, or v10.
- A workaround using an SQL query that creates a command permission overwrite in the database is also provided as a temporary solution.
- The vulnerability has a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 8.8.
- The vulnerability has the following CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H
- The related CWEs are CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The provided commit `ef46ca9` fixes the vulnerability by adding a `PermissionFlags.ManageGuild` check to the command.
