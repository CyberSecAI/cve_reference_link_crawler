Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Custom Post Limits plugin leaving test files with `display_errors` enabled. This setting exposes the full server path of the application when errors occur during script execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the web application's full server path. This occurs due to the `display_errors` setting being enabled in the test files, specifically `bootstrap.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The exposed server path can be used by attackers to gain knowledge of the system's file structure. This information is not directly exploitable but could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to perform more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via unauthenticated requests to the affected test file (`bootstrap.php`). This means no prior user authentication is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can be remote and do not need any special privileges on the server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Custom Post Limits plugin versions up to and including 4.4.1.
-  The specific file exposing the vulnerability is `tests/bootstrap.php` within the plugin directory.
- The Wordfence article states that the information is not useful on its own and requires another vulnerability for a successful attack.
