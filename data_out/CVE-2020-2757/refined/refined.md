Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-2757:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of class descriptors and catching exceptions during object stream deserialization within OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Improper handling of object deserialization.
*   Inadequate exception handling during deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a DoS by processing a specially crafted serialized input.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Processing specially crafted serialized input data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide crafted serialized input to a vulnerable OpenJDK application. This could be achieved through network communication, file upload, or other means depending on how the application processes user-supplied data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources list this CVE as part of a batch of security fixes for OpenJDK vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is described as affecting OpenJDK versions 7 and 8, based on the provided Debian and Fedora update announcements. However, the Ubuntu notice mentions it in the context of OpenJDK 8 and 11, and the Netapp advisory states that versions through 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6, 14 and Java SE Embedded version 8u241 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities. This information suggests the vulnerability affects multiple versions.
*   The provided information suggests a moderate to low severity CVSS score (3.7) according to the NetApp advisory.
*   Several distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE have released security updates to address this and other related vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2020-2757 is a deserialization vulnerability in OpenJDK that can be exploited by providing specially crafted serialized input to cause a denial-of-service.
