Based on the provided information, this content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is command injection vulnerability present in the `cstecgi.cgi` file due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection vulnerability.
- The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied inputs to the "mtu", "mru", "ipsecPsk", "ipsecL2tpEnable", "password", "port", and "timeout" parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the target device.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands by injecting commands into vulnerable parameters, potentially gaining full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are reachable through HTTP POST requests to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`.
- Exploitation requires sending crafted packets containing malicious commands within the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the router.
- The attacker needs to be logged into the device to access vulnerable functionalities.
- The attacker needs to craft and send specific POST requests to the `cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with malicious code injected into the vulnerable parameters.
