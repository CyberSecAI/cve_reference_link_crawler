Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Spectra Plugin (<= 2.6.6) is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows making requests to arbitrary domains controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Website Requests:** An attacker can force the website to make requests to attacker-controlled domains.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** This could potentially expose sensitive information from other services running on the system by making requests to internal services not exposed to the internet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but it would likely involve sending a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin, that contains an attacker-controlled URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin to trigger the SSRF vulnerability. The required privilege level is a 'Contributor'.
