**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2024-28390] Improper Access Control in Advanced Plugins - Image: WebP, Compress, Zoom, Lazy load, Alt & More module for PrestaShop

In the module “Image: WebP, Compress, Zoom, Lazy load, Alt & More” (ultimateimagetool) in versions up to 2.2.01 from Advanced Plugins for PrestaShop, a guest can update all configurations of the PrestaShop.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-28390](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28390)
* **Published at**: 2024-03-12
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: ultimateimagetool
* **Impacted release**: < 2.2.01 (2.2.01 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Advanced Plugins
* **Weakness**: [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.1)

## Description

Due to a predictable token, a guest can update all configurations of the PrestaShop.

Be warned that the author do not follow a compliant semver version.

Note : the author has deleted from his module the files that have been suffering from critical vulnerabilities for months, BUT did not set them to be “auto-deleted” during upgrades. Therefore, there are likely merchants out there with older versions who have updated their modules, thinking they are safe. However, there is nothing safe about that, since past upgrades did not auto-delete the implicated files. To ensure everyone has a “safe version”, we decided to mark all versions up to 2.2.01 as impacted by this issue.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller’s path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see “POST /” inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod\_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Erase/update all configurations from the PrestaShop
* Disable critical security configuration

# Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **ultimateimagetool**.
* You should consider updating the configuration uit\_token for something not predictable
