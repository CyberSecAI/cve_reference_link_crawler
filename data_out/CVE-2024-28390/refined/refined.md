- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A predictable token allows a guest user to update all configurations of the PrestaShop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284). The module uses a predictable token which allows unauthorized access to configuration settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Erase or update all configurations from PrestaShop.
    - Disable critical security configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction required. The attacker can be a guest user. The attacker can conceal the module controller's path by sending a POST request to the root path ("/"), making it difficult to identify the exploit in conventional frontend logs.
