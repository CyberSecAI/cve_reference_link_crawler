# AQL injection through flexSearch in cruddl

Critical

[Yogu](/Yogu)
published
GHSA-qm4w-4995-vg7f
Sep 8, 2022

## Package

npm

cruddl
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0 && < 3.0.2
>= 1.1.0 && < 2.7.0

## Patched versions

3.0.2
2.7.0

## Description

### Impact

If a vunerable version of cruddl is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB.

Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected.

The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl.

### Workarounds

Users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas before they can update cruddl.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
