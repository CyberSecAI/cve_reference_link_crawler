Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when generating ArangoDB AQL queries in the cruddl library. Specifically, the `@flexSearchFulltext` directive allows users to inject arbitrary AQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- AQL Injection: User-controlled input (`value.expression` and `value.analyzer` from `FlexSearchTokenizable`) is directly inserted into the AQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Lack of input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary AQL execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary AQL queries on the ArangoDB database.
- Data breach: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (confidentiality).
- Data manipulation: Attackers could potentially modify or delete data (integrity).
- Denial of service: Attackers could potentially disrupt the availability of the database (availability).

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Exploiting the `@flexSearchFulltext` directive in the schema definition.
- Requires an application that uses a vulnerable version of the cruddl library with a schema utilizing the `@flexSearchFulltext` directive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs at least READ permission to one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of cruddl: >= 3.0.0 && < 3.0.2 and >= 1.1.0 && < 2.7.0.
- Patched versions: 3.0.2 and 2.7.0
- The fix involves using the `aql` template literal to construct queries with parameterization instead of string concatenation
