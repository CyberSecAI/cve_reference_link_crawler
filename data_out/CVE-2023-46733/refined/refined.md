Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `SessionStrategyListener` in Symfony's security component did not always migrate the session after a successful login. It only migrated the session when the logged-in user identifier changed. In cases where the user identifier remained the same between the initial authentication and the successful login, but the authentication token type changed (e.g., from partially-authenticated to fully-authenticated), the session ID was not being regenerated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is a session fixation issue. If the session ID is not regenerated upon successful login, an attacker could potentially hijack an existing session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially fixate a user's session, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account and associated resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves a scenario where a user authenticates with a partially authenticated token and then a fully authenticated token using the same user identifier. The attacker could try to gain an initial session with the partially authenticated token and use that to gain access when the user authenticates fully.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application before and after a user logs in. The attacker could use a partially authenticated token.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `SessionStrategyListener.php` file.
- The fix involves modifying the listener to also check the type of the token, in addition to the user identifier before regenerating the session. The change is located at: `src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/EventListener/SessionStrategyListener.php`
    ```diff
    -        if ('' !== ($user ?? '') && $user === $previousUser) {
    +        if ('' !== ($user ?? '') && $user === $previousUser && \get_class($token) === \get_class($previousToken)) {
    ```
- A test case was added in `src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Tests/EventListener/SessionStrategyListenerTest.php` to cover the case where the user identifier is the same but the token types differ.

**Patched Versions:**

- The vulnerability was patched in versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8 of the `symfony/security-http` and `symfony/symfony` packages.
- Affected versions include:
    - `symfony/security-http` and `symfony/symfony`: >=5.4.21, <5.4.31 and >= 6.2.7, < 6.3.8

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was reported and fixed by Robert Meijers.
- The related commit that introduced the fix is  `dc356499d5ceb86f7cf2b4c7f032eca97061ed74`.
- The fix was also merged to the 5.4 branch using commit `7467bd7e3f888b333102bc664b5e02ef1e7f88b9`.
