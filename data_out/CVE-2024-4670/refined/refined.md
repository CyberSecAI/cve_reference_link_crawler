Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw within the `All-in-One Video Gallery` WordPress plugin.
*   The root cause lies in the insecure handling of the `template` attribute within the `aiovg_search_form` shortcode. This attribute is used to include template files, and the plugin doesn't properly sanitize this input, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin uses user-supplied input to construct a file path for inclusion.  Specifically, the `template` attribute of the `aiovg_search_form` shortcode is not sanitized before being used in an `include` statement in the `public/search.php` file as well as the `public/categories.php` and `widgets/categories.php` files.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the `template` attribute, allowing attackers to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Execution:** By including a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can be achieved by uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g. through an image upload if the file extensions are not restricted in the configuration) and then using the LFI vulnerability to execute it.
*   **Bypass Access Controls:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass access controls, potentially allowing access to sensitive data.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers could include files containing sensitive information.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to full control of the affected WordPress site/server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `aiovg_search_form` shortcode with a malicious `template` attribute.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level permissions on the target WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** Attackers must have a valid WordPress account with at least "Contributor" level access.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to know how to use WordPress shortcodes.
*   **Ability to Inject Shortcode:** The attacker needs to be able to add content containing a shortcode to the website.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7.0 of the plugin.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `template` attribute using `sanitize_file_name()` before including the template files in `public/search.php`, `public/categories.php` and `widgets/categories.php`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn\_) - VNPT-VCI.
