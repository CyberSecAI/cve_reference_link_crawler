### @matias-la **[matias-la](/matias-la)** commented [Jul 12, 2022](#issue-1302522911)

## Description

The regular expression used to parse numbers could be abused to cause a denial of service if the color to be parsed is controlled by an attacker.

For information about this vulnerability, see <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS>.

## Changes

Changed the code so the new regex isn't vulnerable, since there's always only one possible path to take given any input.

Here is a proof-of-concept of how I made the existing regular expression cause a 100% CPU usage for several seconds, after being interrupted:

```
Welcome to Node.js v14.19.3.
Type ".help" for more information.

  code: 'ERR_SCRIPT_EXECUTION_INTERRUPTED'
}
> (new RegExp('^[-+]?\\d*(?:\\.\\d*)?$')).test(`${'1'.repeat(1e6)}z`) // the new regex works fine
false
>

```

| Oops, nice catch! I hadn't notice that. The change in [#3419](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/3419) look good, as it prevents empty strings from matching while also not being vulnerable to ReDoS. |

## Description

PR based on issue requested in comment: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/3382#issuecomment-1195439278

I updated the regex to prevent empty string matches.
The new regex `[-+]?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)` - https://regex101.com/r/aHhlXG/1 is equivalent with the old version `[-+]?\d*\.?\d+` - https://regex101.com/r/Z0xMqR/1

I also tested ReDoS, and the new regex is safe.

PR based on issue requested in comment: [#3382 (comment)](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/3382#issuecomment-1195439278)

I updated the regex to prevent empty string matches.
The new regex `[-+]?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)` - <https://regex101.com/r/aHhlXG/1> is equivalent with the old version `[-+]?\d*\.?\d+` - <https://regex101.com/r/Z0xMqR/1>

I also tested ReDoS, and the new regex is safe.
```
(new RegExp('^[-+]?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)$')).test(`${'1'.repeat(1e6)}z`)
```
```

`[Fix ReDoS when parsing colors (](/wordpress-mobile/react-native-reanimated/commit/f597a7b9602c200932e85b9a806fa985caa3c72c "Fix ReDoS when parsing colors (#3382)

## Description

The regular expression used to parse numbers could be abused to cause a denial of service if the color to be parsed is controlled by an attacker.

For information about this vulnerability, see https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS.

## Changes

Changed the code so the new regex isn't vulnerable, since there's always only one possible path to take given any input.

Here is a proof-of-concept of how I made the existing regular expression cause a 100% CPU usage for several seconds, after being interrupted:

```
