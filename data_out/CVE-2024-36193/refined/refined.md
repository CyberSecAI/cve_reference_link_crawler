Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-36193:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before storing it.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be stored and later executed when a user interacts with the affected content.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R). They must be able to inject the malicious script and a user must then trigger the execution of the script by interacting with it. The scope is changed (S:C), indicating the vulnerability allows the attacker to perform actions in a different security context, impacting the users.

This document provides more details than the basic CVE description by specifying the exact nature of the vulnerability (stored XSS), the impact (arbitrary code execution), the CVSS vector, and the attacker's requirements.
