# User Grant Deactivation not Working

High

## Package

ZITADEL
(ZITADEL)

## Affected versions

<2.54.9, <2.55.7, <2.56.5, <2.57.4, <2.58.4, <2.59.2, <2.60.1, 2.61.0, 2.62.0

## Patched versions

2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, 2.54.10

## Description

### Impact

ZITADEL's user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly. Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources.

Additionally, the management and auth API always returned the state as active or did not provide any information about the state.

### Patches

2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.62.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.62.1)

2.61.x versions are fixed on >= [2.61.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.61.1)

2.60.x versions are fixed on >= [2.60.2](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.60.2)

2.59.x versions are fixed on >= [2.59.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.59.3)

2.58.x versions are fixed on >= [2.58.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.58.5)

2.57.x versions are fixed on >= [2.57.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.57.5)

2.56.x versions are fixed on >= [2.56.6](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.56.6)

2.55.x versions are fixed on >= [2.55.8](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.55.8)

2.54.x versions are fixed on >= [2.54.10](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.54.10)

### Workarounds

Unpatched versions can explicitly remove the user grants to make sure the user does not get access anymore.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
