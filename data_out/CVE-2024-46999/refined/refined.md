- **Root cause of vulnerability:** ZITADEL's user grants deactivation mechanism was not functioning correctly. Deactivated user grants were still included in tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system failed to properly revoke access rights when a user grant was deactivated, leading to the continued provision of access tokens with stale permissions. Additionally, the management and auth API did not reflect the deactivated state.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to applications and resources due to the presence of deactivated user grants in access tokens.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the flawed token generation and validation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires low privileges, and some user interaction, to potentially leverage existing valid tokens. An attacker could use valid tokens containing deactivated user grants to access restricted resources until the user grant removal.
