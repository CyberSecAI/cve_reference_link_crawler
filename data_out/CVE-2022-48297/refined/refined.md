  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The geo-fencing kernel code does not verify the length of the input data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access due to lack of input data length validation."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation may lead to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted input data of improper length to the geo-fencing kernel code."
