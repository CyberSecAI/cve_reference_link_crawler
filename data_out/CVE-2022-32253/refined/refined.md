- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when handling the OpenSSL certificate password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly validate user-provided input, resulting in the OpenSSL certificate password being written to a file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the file where the password is logged can obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can trigger the vulnerability through a network request to the application with a specially crafted input that causes the password to be logged into a reachable file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges (high privileges) to trigger the vulnerability.
