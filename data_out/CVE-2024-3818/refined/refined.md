Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3818

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Social Icons" block of the Essential Blocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 'link' attribute of the "Social Icons" block, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts. This injected script executes when a user accesses the page containing the vulnerable block.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** User input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, which could be used to steal cookies/session data, redirect users to malicious websites, modify page content, and perform other malicious actions.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** If a malicious script is injected into a page that an administrator views, the administrator's account could be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin:** The vulnerability exists within the Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress.
*   **Specific Block:** The "Social Icons" block within the plugin is the vulnerable component.
*   **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-controlled input provided for the 'link' attribute within the social icons block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "contributor" level access or higher. This allows the attacker to create or modify pages and insert the vulnerable social icon block.
*   **Ability to Insert Blocks:** The attacker needs to have the ability to insert and modify blocks, including the vulnerable "Social Icons" block, on pages.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found by João Pedro Soares de Alcântara - Kinorth.
*   The vulnerable versions are all versions up to, and including, 4.5.9.
*   The patch is available in version 4.5.10 where the `sanitizeURL` function has been applied to the `href` attribute of the links in the "Social Icons" block.
