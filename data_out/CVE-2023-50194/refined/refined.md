{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SKP files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves user interaction, requiring the target to either visit a malicious page or open a malicious SKP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file or host a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when accessed by a user."
