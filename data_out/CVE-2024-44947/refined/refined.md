{
  "vulnerability": "The `fuse_notify_store` function in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) module does not properly initialize page contents beyond the end-of-file (EOF) before marking the page as uptodate. This can lead to an information leak.",
  "root_cause": "The `fuse_notify_store` function, unlike `fuse_do_readpage`, does not enable page zeroing, and it fails to fully initialize page contents beyond EOF before marking the page as uptodate.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Insufficient initialization of memory",
    "Information Leak"
  ],
  "impact": "Uninitialized page contents beyond EOF become visible to userspace via mmap(), potentially leaking sensitive information from kernel memory.",
   "attack_vectors": [
    "A malicious FUSE filesystem could cause `fuse_notify_store` to not properly zero out beyond-EOF data, revealing kernel memory to user space through mmap."
    ],
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a FUSE filesystem. The system must not have init-on-alloc enabled (via `CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y` or the corresponding kernel command line parameter)."
