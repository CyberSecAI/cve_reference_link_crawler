Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-7936**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `transferred_report.php` page of the "Project Expense Monitoring System" which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi), specifically affecting the `transferred_report.php` page. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input allowing for manipulation of SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow attackers to:
- Obtain sensitive data from the database.
- Modify data within the database.
- Potentially gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the HTTP POST parameters: `$_POST['start']`, `$_POST['end']`, and `$_POST['employee']` in `transferred_report.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable page, i.e. they need to be able to access the web application. No specific authentication is mentioned in the provided text. The attacker should have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content also includes specific proof-of-concept (POC) payloads demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using different SQL injection techniques:
*   Error-based SQL injection.
*   Time-based blind SQL injection.
*   UNION-based SQL injection.
