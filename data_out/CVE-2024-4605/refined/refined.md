Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Breakdance plugin for WordPress stored custom data in post meta data without using an underscore prefix. WordPress treats metadata with an underscore as protected and does not allow editing via the UI, but without this underscore prefix, lower-privileged users, such as contributors, could directly edit this metadata through the WordPress UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** The vulnerability allowed for arbitrary code injection through the manipulation of post metadata.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Lower privileged users, such as contributors, could escalate their privileges to administrator by modifying the meta data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain administrator-level access to the WordPress site.
- The content mentions the possibility of an attacker using the vulnerability to escalate their privileges, which can then lead to full control of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability was exploitable via the WordPress UI, specifically by editing post metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker must have the ability to access and edit post metadata of affected plugin.
