# Breakdance 1.7.2 Now Available – Security Update

##### Table of Contents

There are no headings in this document.

---

**Important – if you encounter issues after updating, you should:**

* Go to WP Admin > Breakdance > Settings > Tools and click Migrate Meta
* **Clear your cache** with your server / host / cache plugin

---

Breakdance 1.7.2 is a security update that addresses a vulnerability reported to us by security researcher [Francesco Carlucci](https://francescocarlucci.com/).

The issue we have addressed is a privilege escalation vulnerability that would allow a user with “contributor” or higher permissions to escalate their privileges to an admin (CVE-2024-4605). This issue impacts anyone that has granted untrusted users Contributor+ access to their WordPress website. It does not affect you if you do not have Contributor+ users on your WordPress website. This issue can only be exploited by a Contributor+ user.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the timeline (UTC−04:00) for this disclosure & patch:

* May 6th, 6:16 AM: Francesco reported the vulnerability to us.
* May 6th, 6:24 AM: We responded and immediately began workshopping solutions with Francesco, vetting the options to find the most effective and secure route.
* May 7th, 12:55 AM: 1.7.2 was sent to Francesco for verification.
* May 7th, 11:36 AM: Francesco verified the fix. We then did final testing.
* May 7th, 7:30 PM: 1.7.2 released, patching this vulnerability.

## How To Know If You Are Impacted

If there are no non-admin users on your website a role of Contributor or higher, you are not vulnerable.

If you granted non-admin users on your site a role of Contributor or higher, you are impacted. You should upgrade to 1.7.2.

## Updating To 1.7.2

After installing 1.7.2, your site will attempt to automatically perform a migration step. In most cases, this will be a seamless process and your site will experience no downtime.

Possible issues you may experience if the migration fails are: some or all of your site going blank on the front-end, or appearing blank when you open Breakdance to edit some content.

**If your site experiences issues after the update**, here’s what you need to do:

1. Go to Breakdance > Settings > Tools in the WordPress admin panel
2. Click the “Migrate Meta” button
3. **CLEAR ALL CACHES**

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, the issue is unlikely to be related to 1.7.2. Please email support@breakdance.com and our team will be happy to help.

### Downgrading to Previous Versions

If, for some reason, you need to downgrade to a version prior to 1.7.2, you will need to reverse the meta migration.

This can be done under Breakdance > Settings > Tools by clicking the “Undo Migrate Meta” button.

Once the migration has been reversed, you can then install Breakdance 1.7.1 or earlier. Don’t forget to **clear all caches**.

## Other Notes

This specific issue is a great example of how the collaboration between software vendors and security researchers should be handled. Francesco Carlucci disclosed a real, valid vulnerability that could be impactful for some users. We worked with them to find a solution and implemented the solution.

A huge thank you goes out to Francesco Carlucci for bringing this to our attention. This proactive approach to web security is exactly what helps keep the internet a safer place for everyone. As a token of our gratitude, we’ve rewarded Francesco with $500 for the responsible disclosure.
