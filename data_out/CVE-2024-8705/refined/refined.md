Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8705

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `GetDataKindByType` interface of the Shandong Star Measurement and Control Equipment Hot Network Wireless Monitoring System.
*   **Weakness:** The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `dataType` parameter of the `GetDataKindByType` function, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive database information. This could include user credentials, system configurations, or other confidential data.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attack is performed by sending a crafted SOAP request to the `/DataSrvs/UCCGSrv.asmx` endpoint.
    *   The malicious SQL code is injected within the `<tem:dataType>` tag.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target system.
    * Knowledge of the target systemâ€™s endpoint `/DataSrvs/UCCGSrv.asmx` and the SOAP API structure is required.
    * No authentication is needed as the provided POC uses the `ASP.NET_SessionId` cookie but does not seem to require any specific value.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `dataType` within the `GetDataKindByType` function, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a basic SQL injection by injecting a subquery that returns a string with a conditional statement.
*   The injection point is confirmed using SQLmap.

**Affected Product:**

*   Shandong Star Measurement and Control Equipment Hot Network Wireless Monitoring System, version 5.6.2.
