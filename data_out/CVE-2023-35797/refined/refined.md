Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the Apache Hive Provider for Apache Airflow. Specifically, the `proxy_user` option in versions prior to 6.1.2 of the provider did not prevent the injection of semicolons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to sanitize or validate the `proxy_user` input, allowing the injection of semicolons. This lack of proper input handling could enable attackers to manipulate the Beeline command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The injected semicolons could potentially lead to unintended execution of commands through Beeline (a command-line tool for Hive), which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Hive commands beyond what is intended by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input string containing a semicolon within the `proxy_user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the `proxy_user` parameter within the Apache Airflow environment. This could involve manipulating the configuration or other means of injecting malicious input when the Hive provider is used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this issue involved sanitizing the `principal` parameter for Beeline to remove semicolons, as other parameters in Beeline are also not allowed to contain semicolons.
*   CVE-2023-37415 is mentioned as a patch on top of CVE-2023-35797, indicating that CVE-2023-35797 was likely the first issue identified related to input validation in the Hive Provider with `proxy_user`. CVE-2023-37415 addresses the `proxy_user` option being able to inject semicolons, whereas CVE-2023-35797 is mentioned within the description of CVE-2023-37415 but doesn't have a description.

In summary, the core of CVE-2023-35797 is the lack of input sanitization within the Apache Airflow Hive provider, which allows for the injection of semicolons, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution.
