# Envoy OOM vector from HTTP async client with unbounded response buffer for mirror response, and other components

Moderate

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-xcj3-h7vf-fw26
Jun 4, 2024

## Package

source/common/http/async\_client\_impl.cc
(Envoyproxy)

## Affected versions

< 1.30.2

## Patched versions

1.30.2, 1.29.5, 1.28.4, 1.27.6

## Description

### Summary

Envoy exposed an out-of-memory (OOM) vector from the mirror response, since async HTTP client will buffer the response with an unbounded buffer.

### Details

If a mirror cluster decides to send extremely large response messages, those messages are fully buffered in memory by the async HTTP client. This allows a malicious backend to potentially OOM Envoys by sending huge responses.

Other components that are using HTTP async client in Envoy may also be impacted.

* wasm filter
* lua filter
* ext\_proc
* oauth fitler
* ext\_authz
* jwks\_fetcher
* gcp\_auther\_filter
* aws\_metadata\_fetcher
* opentelemetry/http\_trace\_exporter,
* opentelemetry/dynatrace/sampler\_config\_provider
* config\_subscription/rest/rest\_api\_fetcher
* rate\_limiter

Most of the auth/log related extensions assume trusted upstream, while wasm, lua, and ext\_proc may not assume it.

### Impact

Denial of service and Envoy will be OOMed.

### Mitigation

Patched versions:

* disable buffering the mirror response, as Envoy will never use it.
* provide a configuration for the HTTP async client with a default hard limit. Users can set the limit through a runtime key based on needs, protection mechanism, security posture, etc.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
