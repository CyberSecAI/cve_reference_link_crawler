### CVE-2024-1897
The provided content describes a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in the "Grid Gallery â€“ Photo Image Grid Gallery" WordPress plugin, versions 1.4.3 and earlier.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `unserialize()` on base64 decoded data retrieved from the `awl_gg_settings_` meta value. This meta value stores plugin settings that are then unserialized when processing the `[GGAL]` shortcode. The lack of sanitization on this input allows for the injection of arbitrary PHP objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject PHP objects through the deserialization of user-controlled data.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` on user-provided data without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users with Contributor role or higher.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Conditional):** While the vulnerable plugin itself doesn't contain a POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain, if a POP chain is present in another installed plugin or theme, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to:
    - Arbitrary file deletion.
    - Sensitive data retrieval.
    - Full control over the affected server.
- **Denial of Service:** The ability to inject malicious objects could potentially lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `[GGAL]` shortcode is used in a post or page.
- **Meta Value:** The injected object data is stored in the `awl_gg_settings_` post meta.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor role privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin and the shortcode used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **POP Chain (Optional):** To achieve arbitrary code execution, a POP chain must be present within the WordPress installation, either in another plugin or theme. Without a POP chain, the impact would be limited to potentially less severe issues.
