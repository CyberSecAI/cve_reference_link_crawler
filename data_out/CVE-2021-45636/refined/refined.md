- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow. This occurs before authentication, meaning it can be triggered by an unauthenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The advisory mentions a CVSS score of 5.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L. This indicates a medium severity vulnerability where an attacker can potentially cause limited impact to integrity and availability (low confidentiality impact).
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device. No user interaction is required, and no privileges are needed.
