- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `exportAsText` method in Kofax Power PDF exposes a JavaScript interface that allows writing arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows an attacker to write arbitrary files due to insufficient input validation or access control within the `exportAsText` method. This is caused by a dangerous method exposed through a JavaScript interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious page or file that can trigger the vulnerability when opened by a user. The attacker also needs to be able to get the user to interact with their malicious content.
