How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=690555#c0)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2009-06-21 14:32:13 UTC  ``` As disclosed[1] there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function parsing code for exponential functions. The original report is cited below. The fix is trivial: check if func->n is >= MAXN after assigning it.  From: c (cc.cc) Date: Fri Apr 24 2009 - 16:26:41 CDT  The overflow occurs at the following location:  mupdf/mupdf/pdf_function.c:1167      obj = fz_dictgets(dict, "C0");     if (fz_isarray(obj))     {         func->n = fz_arraylen(obj);         for (i = 0; i < func->n; ++i)             func->u.e.c0[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i));     }  func->n is used without being checked first. There are a few integer overflows elsewhere in the code as well.   [1] <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-04/0258.html?esohkb> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=690555#c1)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2009-06-21 14:34:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 5134](attachment.cgi?id=5134 "This is the original .pdf that causes the problem.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=5134&action=edit "This is the original .pdf that causes the problem.")
