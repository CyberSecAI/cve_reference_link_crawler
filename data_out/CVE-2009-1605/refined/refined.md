Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check when parsing exponential functions in the MuPDF library. Specifically, when loading the `C0` array from a PDF dictionary, the code reads the length of the array, `func->n`, from the PDF file, and iterates through this array copying data to a fixed-size buffer `func->u.e.c0[i]`. If the provided array length `func->n` is larger than the fixed buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The code fails to validate the size of an input array against the size of the buffer it's writing to.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software lacks proper validation on the length of the array, `func->n`, read from the PDF document, before copying data into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to memory corruption, as the code writes beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a buffer overflow of this type can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully crafts a malicious PDF to overwrite critical parts of memory. This is highly dependent on the specific memory layout and compiler behavior.
*   **Denial of Service:** At minimum, an attacker could craft a PDF that triggers the overflow, causing a crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Document:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document containing an exponential function with an oversized `C0` array.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when MuPDF parses this crafted PDF file, during the parsing of the exponential function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a crafted PDF file:** An attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious PDF file containing an exponential function with an excessively large `C0` array.
*   **Ability to get a victim to process the malicious PDF file:** The attacker needs to get a victim to open and parse the crafted PDF file using the vulnerable MuPDF library, which can be through email attachments, file sharing, or malicious websites, for example.

**Additional Details**

*   The provided cgit commit log identifies the fix for this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure `func->n` is within the allowed range before copying array elements.
* The bug report from bugs.ghostscript.com provides details of the vulnerability and the patch applied for the fix.
* The vulnerability was originally disclosed on the Full Disclosure mailing list.
