| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=690555#c0)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2009-06-21 14:32:13 UTC  ``` As disclosed[1] there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function parsing code for exponential functions. The original report is cited below. The fix is trivial: check if func->n is >= MAXN after assigning it.  From: c (cc.cc) Date: Fri Apr 24 2009 - 16:26:41 CDT  The overflow occurs at the following location:  mupdf/mupdf/pdf_function.c:1167      obj = fz_dictgets(dict, "C0");     if (fz_isarray(obj))     {         func->n = fz_arraylen(obj);         for (i = 0; i < func->n; ++i)             func->u.e.c0[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i));     }  func->n is used without being checked first. There are a few integer overflows elsewhere in the code as well.
