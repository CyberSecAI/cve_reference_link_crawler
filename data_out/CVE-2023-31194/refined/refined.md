- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper array index validation in the `GraphPlanar::Write` function of Diagon. The vulnerability occurs due to inconsistencies in graph manipulation using `boost::vecS` and subsequent calls to `boost` functions, resulting in a mismatch between the size of the `ordering` vector and the `inverse_ordering` vector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read and write due to the size mismatch between `ordering` and `inverse_ordering` vectors. This is caused by the usage of `boost::vecS` to store edges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, leading to a segmentation fault and potentially other arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted markdown file with specific graph representation can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable `diagon` tool, using the `GraphPlanar` translator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious markdown file to a victim. The victim needs to open the file using the vulnerable `diagon` application.
