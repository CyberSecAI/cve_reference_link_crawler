Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-25092:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The provided content describes fixes for multiple vulnerabilities in the DiscordSailv2 project. These fixes are related to:

1.  **Mention abuse:** A vulnerability in some commands allowed users to use mentions they would not normally have access to.
2.  **Tag handler vulnerability:** A vulnerability in the tag handler allowed users to use mentions.
3. **Rulecode visibility:** A bug in the `GetGuildInfo` command output exposed the `Rulecode` value.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities seems to be improper input sanitization/validation in several different parts of the application. Specifically:

*   The application failed to properly check user permissions before allowing the use of mentions, which allowed users to potentially mention and thus notify users that they should not have had access to.
* The tag handler was not correctly handling user input, allowing for arbitrary mentions.
* The `GetGuildInfo` command was outputting sensitive internal information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The commands failed to properly authorize the user making the request.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `Rulecode` value was being leaked, exposing sensitive information.
*   **Improper input handling:** The tag handler was not properly handling user input, leading to the mention abuse vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Mentions:** Attackers could mention users they are not normally allowed to. This could potentially be used to send malicious/spam messages and cause undue disturbance.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `Rulecode` value could potentially expose sensitive information about the bot and its inner workings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Users could exploit the vulnerable commands by providing crafted inputs with mentions, which were not properly handled by the application.
*   Users with access to the `GetGuildInfo` command could view the `Rulecode` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be a user of the Discord bot.
*   The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable commands or the tag handler.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes the fixes for vulnerabilities in DiscordSailv2. These vulnerabilities included authorization bypass via mention abuse, input handling flaws in the tag handler, and information disclosure. All the issues were addressed in the 2.10.3 release by sanitizing user inputs and properly authorizing the use of commands/features.
