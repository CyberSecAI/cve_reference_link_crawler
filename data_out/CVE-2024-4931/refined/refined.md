Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application directly incorporates the `$_GET['id']` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality: Attackers can access sensitive database information by using techniques like UNION-based SQL injection.
- Integrity: Attackers might modify or delete data within the database.
- Availability: Attackers could potentially disrupt the system's availability by injecting queries that cause errors or excessive resource consumption.
- The attacker can obtain database names and usernames, which provides further details about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/index.php` with the `page=view_udet` parameter and a manipulated `id` parameter.
- Remote: The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- No special privileges are needed.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to construct the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']` in the `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/index.php?page=view_udet` endpoint.
- The vulnerable code directly concatenates the unsanitized `id` parameter into an SQL query.
- The attacker can use techniques such as `UNION` queries to extract information.
- The provided content also shows a successful sqlmap test.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Simple Online Bidding System".

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as critical with a CVSS score of 7.3 (VulDB Meta Temp Score) and 9.8 (NVD Base Score).
- The exploit is public and is available as a proof-of-concept.
- The MITRE ATT&CK technique is T1505.
- The relevant CWE is CWE-89, which describes improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.

The provided content clearly outlines an SQL injection vulnerability in the "SourceCodester Simple Online Bidding System" and provides sufficient details for understanding the vulnerability and its exploitability.
