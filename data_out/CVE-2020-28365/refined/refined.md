Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28365 (Note: The provided document from wizlynxgroup.com indicates the CVE ID is pending, but it's highly likely referring to CVE-2020-28365).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The application does not properly sanitize the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The injected malicious payload is stored in the application's logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* When an administrator views the user logs, the injected JavaScript payload is executed in their browser.
* This can lead to the attacker being able to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, such as stealing session cookies, manipulating data, or performing other malicious actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Header Injection:** The attack vector is through the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header during the login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted HTTP requests, which could be a user attempting to login, or other methods to send the header.
* **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the user logs containing the injected payload. The administrator needs to interact with the logs for the attack to be successful.
