- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ArtPlacer Widget plugin lacks authorization checks when deleting widgets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, leading to broken access control. Specifically, any authenticated user, including subscribers, can delete arbitrary widgets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary widgets on the WordPress site, potentially disrupting the website's appearance and functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `artplacer_del` and the ID of the widget to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least the 'subscriber' role. They can trigger the request using HTML containing a form with the necessary parameters.
