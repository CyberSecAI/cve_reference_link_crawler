Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1794:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Forminator plugin for WordPress. This allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts via an uploaded file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within an uploaded file, and it does not adequately escape output when that file's content is displayed on a web page. This leads to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **Compromise of User Sessions**: When a user accesses a page where the malicious code is displayed, the injected script executes, allowing the attacker to potentially hijack sessions and access other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious file containing the XSS payload through the plugin's file upload functionality. This can be an attacker inserting malicious code inside of a file format that isn't checked properly like a .3gpp file as indicated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated access** - An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Upload file** - The attacker needs to be able to utilize the plugin's file upload functionality

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Forminator plugin versions up to and including 1.29.0.
*   The Wordfence article mentions that a 3gpp file could be used as a carrier.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on March 29, 2024, and last updated April 9, 2024.
