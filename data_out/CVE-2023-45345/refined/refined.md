Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45345:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly relates to CVE-2023-45345, as it is explicitly listed as one of the multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the "Online Food Ordering System v1.0"

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of input validation for the `*_deleted` parameter within the `routers/user-router.php` resource. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
     - Data breaches (reading sensitive data from the database)
     - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
     - Potential full control of the database and underlying system

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP POST requests to the `routers/user-router.php` endpoint, with the vulnerable parameter in the request body.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
   - **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
if(preg_match("/[0-9]+_deleted/",$key)){
 $key = strtok($key, '_');
 $sql = "UPDATE users SET deleted = '$value' WHERE id = $key;";
 $con->query($sql);
}
```
This code uses a regular expression to check if the parameter name (`$key`) matches a pattern. It then extracts the numeric ID part of the parameter, but it fails to sanitize the `$value` variable. This `$value` is directly inserted into the SQL UPDATE statement, enabling SQL injection. The `deleted` column from the `users` table can be modified with the injected SQL code.
