## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Watu Quiz < 3.4.1.2 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow users such as authors (if they've been authorized by admins) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Allow Authors to access the plugin's settings.
2. Using an Author account, edit the demo Quiz questions.
3. Use the following within the question and answers: Answer One `<img src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
4. Browse the Quiz on the front-end and notice the alert triggers.
