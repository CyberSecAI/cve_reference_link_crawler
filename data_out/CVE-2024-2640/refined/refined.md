- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Watu Quiz plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, specifically within the quiz questions and answers. When a user views the quiz on the front-end, the injected script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have author-level access (or higher) to the WordPress site, specifically the ability to modify the quiz questions and answers within the Watu Quiz plugin. The attacker also needs to have permission to access the plugin's settings.
