- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the username field during the login process. The application only trims leading and trailing spaces, failing to properly neutralize potentially malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate filtering of user-supplied input. The application's security filter only escapes a limited set of special characters, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which can be executed in the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or further malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the username field during the login process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to interact with the login page of the vulnerable XunRuiCMS instance. No prior authentication is required.
