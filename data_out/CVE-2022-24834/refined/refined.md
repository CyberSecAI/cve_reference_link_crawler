Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A specially crafted Lua script executed within Redis can trigger a heap overflow. The vulnerability lies within the `cjson` and `cmsgpack` libraries, which are used by Redis for Lua scripting support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap overflow in `cjson` and `cmsgpack` libraries.
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization when handling Lua scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap corruption
- Potential remote code execution (RCE)
- Disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS) (NetApp description)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Execution of a specially crafted Lua script within Redis.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated and authorized user of Redis.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute Lua scripts in Redis (EVAL or EVALSHA commands).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6.
- The issue is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.12, 6.2.13, and 6.0.20.
- A workaround is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts by using ACLs to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.
