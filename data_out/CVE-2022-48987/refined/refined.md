The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48987.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from overly strict sanity checks on the blanking fields within the v4l2_bt_timings structure. These checks were implemented to prevent integer overflows when userspace provides unusual values. However, the initial implementation assumed that userspace would always correctly populate front porch, back porch, and sync values separately. In reality, sometimes only the total blanking value is known, which may be distributed among these fields. This caused legitimate configurations to fail the checks, creating a denial-of-service by preventing valid video timings from being accepted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is overly restrictive validation of blanking values in v4l2_dv_timings. The checks assumed a specific distribution of total blanking values across individual fields which is not always the case, leading to a false positive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is a denial of service. Specifically, valid video timings might be rejected by the kernel due to the overly strict checks. This would prevent applications from using video capture devices with specific, but valid, timings configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious or improperly configured userspace application providing v4l2_dv_timings values that pass the initial type check, but fail the overly strict blanking checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to interact with the V4L2 API and be able to set the v4l2_dv_timings structure through ioctls, typically achieved by running code locally as a privileged or unprivileged user.
