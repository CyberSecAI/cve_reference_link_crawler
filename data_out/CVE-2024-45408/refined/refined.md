**Root Cause:**

*   An incorrect permission check within the elabftw application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that the system fails to properly enforce access restrictions. This allows authenticated users (and potentially unauthenticated users if anonymous access is enabled) to access information they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability leads to the exposure of restricted information. The specific types of information are not detailed here, but the impact is rated as having "High" confidentiality impact.
*   The vulnerability allows both "direct and indirect information disclosure".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, implying it can be exploited remotely.
*   **Authentication**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user. If anonymous access is enabled, this can be exploited by anyone.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   An attacker could be an authenticated user, or if anonymous access is allowed on the system, then no authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected version is any version greater than 4.4.0 and prior to the patched version, which is 5.1.0
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.5, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
