- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing SSL certificate validation during the installation process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure installation mechanism. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the SSL certificate when downloading installation files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker can intercept network traffic between the application and its server during the installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MitM attack, typically by being on the same network as the victim, or by controlling a network hop that the victim's traffic passes through.
