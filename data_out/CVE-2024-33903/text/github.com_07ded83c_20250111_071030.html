| After some quick tests, this issue seems to always happen with invincible pedestrians as shown with the script below. Additionally, the direction of the actor that is collided with seems to also affect its detection, but I haven't managed to create a script that fully reproduces it  [coll\_test.zip](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/files/14944300/coll_test.zip) |

Sorry that I forgot a detail. I replace the "tesla.model3" in FollowLeadingVehicle.xsoc file as "**vehicle.bh.crossbike**" which also belongs to *vehicle* type in Carla(<https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bp_library/>). Attached is the modified FollowLeadingVehicle.xsoc for you to refer, please have a try. [FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc.zip](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/files/14986138/FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc.zip)  Following the code and the command provided in the FollowLeadingVehicle part, you can get the unreported collision events as the video shows in the corresponding issue: [#7025 (comment)](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7025#issuecomment-2046609937)  FollowLeadingVehicle:  python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 5 12 0.15 -0.01 2000 python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 6 34 0.8 -0.45 2000 python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 6 14 0.9 -0.05 2000  If any further information needed, please let me know. Thanks. |
