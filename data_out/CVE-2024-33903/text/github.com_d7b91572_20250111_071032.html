### @Blyron **[Blyron](/Blyron)** commented [Apr 16, 2024](#issue-2245682796)

#### Description

Exposing collision sensor function to BP incase we have false negatives to notify such as Walkers Overlaps events. We will need to look further into this logic.

Fixes [#7025](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7025) [#7394](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7394)

#### Where has this been tested?

* **Platform(s):** Ubuntu 20.04
* **Python version(s):** .3.8.10
* **Unreal Engine version(s):** 4.26

#### Possible Drawbacks

Normal Impulse not properly added in recorder. False positives appear.

Sorry, something went wrong.
