### @Blyron **[Blyron](/Blyron)** commented [Apr 16, 2024](#issue-2245682796)

#### Description

Exposing collision sensor function to BP incase we have false negatives to notify such as Walkers Overlaps events. We will need to look further into this logic.

Fixes [#7025](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7025) [#7394](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7394)

#### Where has this been tested?

* **Platform(s):** Ubuntu 20.04
* **Python version(s):** .3.8.10
* **Unreal Engine version(s):** 4.26

#### Possible Drawbacks

Normal Impulse not properly added in recorder. False positives appear.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| After some quick tests, this issue seems to always happen with invincible pedestrians as shown with the script below. Additionally, the direction of the actor that is collided with seems to also affect its detection, but I haven't managed to create a script that fully reproduces it  [coll\_test.zip](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/files/14944300/coll_test.zip) |

Sorry that I forgot a detail. I replace the "tesla.model3" in FollowLeadingVehicle.xsoc file as "**vehicle.bh.crossbike**" which also belongs to *vehicle* type in Carla(<https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bp_library/>). Attached is the modified FollowLeadingVehicle.xsoc for you to refer, please have a try. [FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc.zip](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/files/14986138/FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc.zip)  Following the code and the command provided in the FollowLeadingVehicle part, you can get the unreported collision events as the video shows in the corresponding issue: [#7025 (comment)](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7025#issuecomment-2046609937)  FollowLeadingVehicle:  python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 5 12 0.15 -0.01 2000 python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 6 34 0.8 -0.45 2000 python ego\_vehicle\_github.py FollowLeadingVehicle 20 1 0 6 14 0.9 -0.05 2000  If any further information needed, please let me know.

# Core concepts

This page introduces the main features and modules in CARLA. Detailed explanations of the different subjects can be found in their corresponding page.

In order to learn about the different classes and methods in the API, take a look at the [Python API reference](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/python_api.md).

!!! Important
**This documentation refers to CARLA 0.9.X**.

The API changed significantly from previous versions (0.8.X). There is another documentation regarding those versions that can be found [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

---

## First steps

### 1st- World and client

**The client** is the module the user runs to ask for information or changes in the simulation. A client runs with an IP and a specific port. It communicates with the server via terminal. There can be many clients running at the same time. Advanced multiclient managing requires thorough understanding of CARLA and [synchrony](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_synchrony_timestep.md).

**The world** is an object representing the simulation. It acts as an abstract layer containing the main methods to spawn actors, change the weather, get the current state of the world, etc. There is only one world per simulation. It will be destroyed and substituted for a new one when the map is changed.

### 2nd- Actors and blueprints

An actor is anything that plays a role in the simulation.

* Vehicles.
* Walkers.
* Sensors.
* The spectator.
* Traffic signs and traffic lights.

**Blueprints** are already-made actor layouts necessary to spawn an actor. Basically, models with animations and a set of attributes. Some of these attributes can be customized by the user, others don't. There is a [**Blueprint library**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/bp_library.md) containing all the blueprints available as well as information on them.

### 3rd- Maps and navigation

**The map** is the object representing the simulated world, the town mostly. There are eight maps available. All of them use OpenDRIVE 1.4 standard to describe the roads.

**Roads, lanes and junctions** are managed by the [Python API](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/python_api.md) to be accessed from the client. These are used along with the **waypoint** class to provide vehicles with a navigation path.

**Traffic signs** and **traffic lights** are accessible as [**carla.Landmark**](#python_api.md#carla.landmark) objects that contain information about their OpenDRIVE definition. Additionally, the simulator automatically generates stops, yields and traffic light objects when running using the information on the OpenDRIVE file. These have bounding boxes placed on the road. Vehicles become aware of them once inside their bounding box.

### 4th- Sensors and data

**Sensors** wait for some event to happen, and then gather data from the simulation. They call for a function defining how to manage the data. Depending on which, sensors retrieve different types of **sensor data**.

A sensor is an actor attached to a parent vehicle. It follows the vehicle around, gathering information of the surroundings. The sensors available are defined by their blueprints in the [Blueprint library](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/bp_library.md).

* Cameras (RGB, depth and semantic segmentation).
* Collision detector.
* Gnss sensor.
* IMU sensor.
* Lidar raycast.
* Lane invasion detector.
* Obstacle detector.
* Radar.
* RSS.

## Advanced steps

CARLA offers a wide range of features that go beyond the scope of this introduction to the simulator. Here are listed some of the most remarkable ones. However, it is highly encouraged to read the whole **First steps** section before starting with the advanced steps.

* [**OpenDRIVE standalone mode**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_opendrive.md). Generates a road mesh using only an OpenDRIVE file. Allows to load any OpenDRIVE map into CARLA without the need of creating assets.
* [**PTV-Vissim co-simulation**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_ptv.md). Run a synchronous simulation between CARLA and PTV-Vissim traffic simulator.
* [**Recorder**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_recorder.md). Saves snapshots of the simulation state to reenact a simulation with exact precision.
* [**Rendering options**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_rendering_options.md). Graphics quality settings, off-screen rendering and a no-rendering mode.
* [**RSS**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_rss.md). Integration of the [C++ Library for Responsibility Sensitive Safety](https://github.com/intel/ad-rss-lib) to modify a vehicle's trajectory using safety checks.
* [**Simulation time and synchrony**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_synchrony_timestep.md). Everything regarding the simulation time and server-client communication.
* [**SUMO co-simulation**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_sumo.md). Run a synchronous simulation between CARLA and SUMO traffic simulator.
* [**Traffic manager**](/carla-simulator/carla/blob/60bd026b4822b4edb8a68cc17b9119866f303853/Docs/adv_traffic_manager.md). This module is in charge of every vehicle set to autopilot mode. It simulates traffic in the city for the simulation to look like a real urban environment.

| CARLA version: 0.9.13  Platform/OS: ubuntu 18.04  Problem you have experienced: Possible Bug: The collision sensor doesn't work in some conditions. What you expected to happen: The collision sensor should report the collision event whenever the collision happens.  Steps to reproduce: We used Scenario Runner and tested different scenarios like FollowLeadingVehicle, IntersectionCollisionAvoidance, LaneChangeSimple, etc. We discovered that sometimes collisions were visible to the naked eye, but the collision detector did not report the event. Here are some videos and the corresponding parameters:    video.mp4     Above is the FollowLeadingVehicle scenario, we set the initial driving speed of the vehicle is 20, which does not affect the final result because it seems that the vehicle doesn't need the acceleration process when changing speed in Carla. When the ego vehicle is 4m away from the NPC actor, we change the driving speed to 6, and change the driving angle to (x = 1 and y = -0.31).  initial speed: 20 distance to change driving behavior: 4m speed after change driving behavior: 6 driving angle after change driving behavior: (x = 1, y = -0.31)  The collision sensor attached on ego vehicle doesn't report the collision event. For the sake of caution and fairness, we also attached a collision sensor on the NPC actor, it also failed to report the incident. We have run multiple rounds of tests in different scenarios and this problem appeared under different parameters. We are working on finding some patterns in the data results. Now at first glance, it looks like low speed, pedestrians, and bicycles are a few of the elements more prone to this problem, however, there are also cases of non-report when NPC is a vehicle. We will report the conclusion later. |

| Hi, I found some users reported issues with the collision sensor of the old version(ref [#3183](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/3183)). It is said that the old issues were fixed in Carla0.9.10 but I found issues with the collision sensor still exist in Carla 0.9.13. It seems like the old issues haven't been totally fixed or the last fix brings new problems. Could you please check? Thanks.

| Sure! Below is the code I use. Usage: The usage is:   1. Run the scenario runner code to launch a pre-defined scenario:   python scenario\_runner.py --openscenario srunner/examples/FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc --record all\_temp\_data/temp\_data0 --port=2000 (for example here I use the FollowLeadingVehicle.xosc, it may need to change to other related scenarios)   2. Then run the code snippet I provided below with the configuration data in ***exact configuration*** part, which is used for controlling the ego vehicle.

corresponding to the initial driving speed, initial driving angle x, initial driving angle y, distance between ego vehicle and other actor to change the driving behavior, new driving speed, new driving angle x, new driving angle y, etc. You can read the args part in the attached code for the meaning) Exact configuration: Here are some samples that will create the bug scenarios, if you run it, and it report a normal collision event or no collision happened, try to run it **multiple times** since the simulation has some randomness.  **FollowLeadingVehicle**:   1. python

| Hello!  Could supply the code which you found the issue? Thanks!  Hi Blyron, I posted the related code and configuration, please have a try. I use Carla 0.9.13 on ubuntu18.04. If you run the code and the simulator reports a normal collision or non-collision, please try to run it multiple times since the simulation randomness. If you have any further questions, please let me know.  Thanks! |

BTW, not only pedestrians have the error, I forgot to mention that I replaced the vehicle in FollowLeadingVehicel.xsoc as a bicycle which also belongs to the vehicle class in Carla. Thus we have the error video as shown in the above comments. I provided the details in [#7394 (comment)](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7394#issuecomment-2058130066) for you to refer.  Thanks. |

I will try the invincible pedestrian code in my project and give you the results. Could you please help to apply for a CVE ID for this vulnerability as the developer? Thanks. |

| Hi Blyron,  Sorry for the late response. I tried the "is\_invincible" option for pedestrians, but Carla still failed to detect it. I have tested the latest version of Carla 0.9.15 (after you fix the bug), and the bug seems to still exist. I also found some interesting findings; I compared the pre-release version of Carla 0.9.13 (in .tar.gz) and the compiled version; some ignored collision cases shown in the pre-release version but not shown in the compiled. I don't know why, but maybe you can dig into it.  I found two more new conditions in which the ignored collisions would happen.

```
* CARLA 0.9.15

* Added Digital Twins feature version 0.1. Now you can create your own map based on OpenStreetMaps
* Added compatibility with SymReady Assets, using NVIDIA Omniverse
* Added new maps: Town13 (is a large map) and Town15
* The spectator will be used to load tiles and actor in Large Maps when no other actors with the rolename 'ego_vehicle' or 'hero' are present. Added the `spectator_as_ego` to the `carla.WorldSettings()` to allow users to disable this behavior.
* Add keyword arguments for `carla.TrafficManager` Python API functions
* Added build support for VS2022 and Ninja for LibCarla and osm2odr on Windows
* Added empty actor
* Restored gamma value to 2.2 instead of 2.4
* CarlaExporter tool now exports the box collider and convex collider of the object if it has one, otherwise the mesh
* Pedestrians with AI or in replayer are now faster around 10x. They have collisions disabled until they hit a vehicle.
* Added API function to avoid replaying the spectator
  * `Client.set_replayer_ignore_spectator(bool)`
  * `start_replaying.py` using flag `--move-spectator`
* Surface non-unity build mode by passing ARGS=--no-unity to make; allows IWYU-type errors to be unmasked and fixed.
* Added maps, vehicles, pedestrians and props catalogues to the documentation
* Collisions detected by the CollisionSensor no longer generate more than one event per frame.
* Added API function to load a map only if it is different from the current one.
* Fixed a bug in the TrafficManager causing vehicles that reached an ending lane to have abnormal behavior while lane changing.
* Fixed bug causing the TM's unstuck logic to incorrectly remove the vehicles in some situations.
* Fixed the extra data in Directx textures, so we need to copy row by row on Windows to remove extra bytes on images
* Fixed vertices of big meshes (more than 65k vertices) in CarlaExporter
* Fixed sensors to check for the stream to be ready (race condition)
* Fixed bug causing the `FPixelReader::SavePixelsToDisk(PixelData, FilePath)` function to crash due to pixel array not set correctly.
* Fixed segfaults in Python API due to incorrect GIL locking under Python 3.10.
* Fixed the import script, where could use any other TilesInfo.txt if the destination folder has many

CARLA 0.9.14

  * Fixed bug in FrictionTrigger causing sometimes server segfault
  * Added attachment type "SpringArmGhost" for cinematic cameras but without doing the collision test.
  * Improved algorithm to move signals out of the road by computing the desired displacement direction.
  * Added `TrafficManager.vehicle_lane_offset(actor, offset)` and `TrafficManager.global_lane_offset(offset)` methods.
  * Some of the warnings shown when building a map will now only be showing when debugging.
  * The ids for semantic segmentation has been modified to be the same as cityscapes (labels, ids and colors)
  * Fixed bug causing traffic signals at the end points of a road to sometimes create malformed waypoints.
  * Fixed pedestrian skeleton frame, where sometimes it was draw displaced from the body
  * Fixed decals when importing maps. It was using other .json files found in other packages.
  * In multi-GPU mode some sensors now are forced to be created on the primary server always (ex. collision sensor)
  * Added the speed limits for 100, 110 and 120 Km/h.
  * Fixing sensor destruction, now the stream and socket is succesfully destroyed.
  * Fixed bug at `Vehicle.get_traffic_light_state()` and `Vehicle.is_at_traffic_light()` causing vehicles to temporarily not lose the information of a traffic light if they moved away from it before it turned green.
  * Changed the height of the automatic spawn points, from 3m to only 0.5m
  * Added pedestrian skeleton to the recorder, as additional data. They will replay with the exact pose.
  * Added multi-GPU feature. Now several servers (with dedicated GPU) can render sensors for the same simulation.
  * Fixed bug causing the `Vehicle.get_traffic_light_state()` function not notify about the green to yellow and yellow to red light state changes.
  * Fixed bug causing the `Vehicle.is_at_traffic_light()` function to return *false* if the traffic light was green.
  * Fixed bug causing the scene lights to return an incorrect location at large maps.
  * Fixed bug causing the `world.ground_projection()` function to return an incorrect location at large maps.
  * Added failure state to vehicles, which can be retrieved by using `Vehicle.get_failure_state()`. Only Rollover failure state is currently supported.
  * Fixed bug causing the TM to block the simulation when a vehicle with no physics was teleported.
  * Fixed bug causing the TM to block the simulation when travelling through a short roads that looped on themselves.
  * Improved the TM's handling of non signalized junctions, resulting in a more fluid overall behavior.
  * Added check to avoid adding procedural trigger boxes inside intersections.
  * Python agents now accept a carla.Map and GlobalRoutePlanner instances as inputs, avoiding the need to recompute them.
  * Python agents now have a function to lane change.
  * Python agents now detect vehicle in adjacent lanes if invaded due to the offset.
  * Fixed bug causing the python agents to sometimes not detect a blocking actor if there were severral actors around it.
  * Improved Python agents performance for large maps.
  * Fix a bug at `Map.get_topology()`, causing lanes with no successors to not be part of it.
  * Added new ConstantVelocityAgent
  * Added new parameter to the TrafficManager, `set_desired_speed`, to set a vehicle's speed.
  * Added 4 new attributes to all vehicles:
    - `base_type` can be use as a vehicle classification. The possible values are  *car*, *truck*, *van*, *motorcycle* and *bycicle*.
    - `special_type` provides more information about the vehicle. It is currently restricted to *electric*, *emergency* and *taxi*, and not all vehicles have this attribute filled.
    - `has_dynamics_doors` can either be *true* or *false* depending on whether or not the vehicle has doors that can be opened using the API.
    - `has_lights` works in the same way as *has_dynamic_doors*, but differentiates between vehicles with lights, and those that don't.
  * Added native ackermann controller:
    - `apply_ackermann_control`:  to apply an ackermann control command to a vehicle
    - `get_ackermann_controller_settings`: to get the last ackermann controller settings applied
    - `apply_ackermann_controller_settings`: to apply new ackermann controller settings
  * Fixed bug causing the Traffic Manager to not be deterministic when using hybrid mode
  * Added `NormalsSensor`, a new sensor with normals information
  * Added support for N wheeled vehicles
  * Added support for new batch commands ConsoleCommand, ApplyLocation (to actor), SetTrafficLightState
  * Added new API function: `set_day_night_cycle` at the LightManager, to (de)activate the automatic switch of the lights when the simulation changes from day to night mode, and viceversa.
  * Switch to boost::variant2 for rpc::Command as that allows more than 20 RPC commands
  * Added post process effects for rainy and dusty weathers.
  * Switched data type of the dust storm weather parameter from bool to float.
  * Check for the version of the installed Clang compiler during build.
  * Added API function to get direct access to the GBuffer textures of a sensor:
    - `listen_to_gbuffer`: to set a callback for a specific GBuffer texture
