Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor" (CWE-200) in FortiClient for Windows, Linux, and Mac. This implies that the application is not properly restricting access to certain information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is that a local, authenticated attacker can retrieve a list of files or folders that are excluded from malware scanning. This information is considered sensitive because it reveals which parts of the system are not being protected by the scanner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited direct impact:** The vulnerability itself does not allow the attacker to execute code or directly compromise the system.
*   **Indirect impact:** The disclosure of excluded files and folders can provide an attacker with valuable information for planning further attacks. For instance, knowing which folders are excluded may allow an attacker to place malicious files in those locations knowing they will not be scanned by FortiClient.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where FortiClient is installed. This implies that they must already have a user account on the machine.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be authenticated; no Administrative privileges are required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local, authenticated access**: The attacker needs a valid user account on the target machine.
*   **No Admin Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected versions:**
*   FortiClientLinux 7.2: 7.2.0
*   FortiClientLinux 7.0: All versions
*   FortiClientLinux 6.4: All versions
*  FortiClientLinux 6.2: All versions
*   FortiClientMac 7.2: 7.2.0 through 7.2.1
*   FortiClientMac 7.0: All versions
*   FortiClientMac 6.4: All versions
*   FortiClientMac 6.2: All versions
*   FortiClientWindows 7.2: 7.2.0
*   FortiClientWindows 7.0: All versions
*   FortiClientWindows 6.4: All versions
*   FortiClientWindows 6.2: All versions

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to FortiClientLinux 7.2.1 or above. Migrate to a fixed release for other affected FortiClientLinux versions.
*   Upgrade to FortiClientMac 7.2.2 or above. Migrate to a fixed release for other affected FortiClientMac versions.
*   Upgrade to FortiClientWindows 7.2.1 or above. Migrate to a fixed release for other affected FortiClientWindows versions.
