Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38428:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

*   The provided content includes a commit message specifically mentioning "ksmbd: fix wrong UserName check in session_user" and directly references "CVE-2023-38428" in the commit description from `git.kernel.org`.
* The NetApp advisory also directly mentions CVE-2023-38428 as a vulnerability affecting its products that incorporate the Linux kernel.
    Therefore, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect validation of the `UserName` field within the SMB session setup process in the ksmbd module of the Linux kernel.
    * Specifically, the code was comparing the combined length and offset of the username against the length of the entire authentication message (`auth_msg_len`), rather than the length of the security buffer (`secbuf_len`) where the username is actually located.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incorrect Length Check:** The core vulnerability is the faulty length check that fails to properly validate the bounds of the `UserName` field.
    *   **Out-of-bounds read:** The incorrect length check leads to the possibility of reading beyond the bounds of the security buffer.
    *   **Slab out-of-bounds:**  A specific vulnerability exposed is the slab-out-of-bounds in `smb_strndup_from_utf16` function.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data beyond the security buffer's intended boundaries due to the out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The slab-out-of-bounds read could also result in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered during SMB session setup.
    * An attacker could send a malformed SMB2 Session Setup request that causes the vulnerability.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable ksmbd server using the SMB2 protocol.
    * No specific privileges required to exploit it.

**3. Technical Details from the Patch**

*   The patch modifies the `session_user` function in `fs/ksmbd/smb2pdu.c`.
*   The key change is the replacement of `auth_msg_len` with `secbuf_len` in the bounds check:

    *   This ensures that the username length and offset are validated against the actual size of the security buffer, preventing the out-of-bounds read.

**4. Additional notes**
* The NetApp advisory indicates this vulnerability affects multiple NetApp products which incorporate the Linux kernel. It includes details on affected product versions, remediation status and workarounds.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-38428 is a critical vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ksmbd module arising from an incorrect bounds check on the username field during session setup in the SMB2 protocol. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure through out-of-bounds read and denial of service due to kernel crashes. The fix replaces a faulty length check with a correct one, referencing the actual size of the relevant buffer.
