Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `formQosManageDouble_user` function in the Tenda W9 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string using the `index` variable (derived from the `ssidIndex` parameter). The `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer's size is fixed, and if the attacker provides a sufficiently large `ssidIndex` value, `sprintf` will write beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Unvalidated user input:** The `ssidIndex` parameter, which is directly user-controlled, is not validated before being used in the `sprintf` function, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote code execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the device. This could lead to a compromise of the device and the network it is connected to.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector involves sending a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker must include the crafted `ssidIndex` value as a parameter in the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access to the device:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Tenda W9 router to send HTTP POST requests to its web interface. The attacker could be on the same local network as the router, or, in some cases, even access the router remotely via a compromised management interface.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable function is `formQosManageDouble_user`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `ssidIndex`, which is used to construct the string `mib_prefix_wl2g`.
*   The `sprintf` function is responsible for writing the crafted string to the `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer, which causes overflow if the crafted string is larger than the buffer.
*   The vulnerability is present in Tenda W9 firmware version `V1.0.0.7(4456)`.
*   A Proof of Concept (POC) is provided, which includes a sample POST request with the `ssidIndex` payload.
