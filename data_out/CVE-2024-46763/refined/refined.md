{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference occurs in the `fou_gro_receive()` function when the socket's user data (`sk->sk_user_data`) is NULL, which happens when the tunnel socket is destroyed after a single RCU grace period due to netns dismantle or explicit tunnel teardown. In-flight GRO packets can still trigger the FOU GRO handler, leading to the dereference of the NULL `sk->sk_user_data` when accessing the `protocol` member.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Race condition during socket teardown and GRO handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to null pointer dereference, potentially leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by normal network operations, specifically when handling Generic Receive Offload (GRO) packets associated with a FOU (FO over UDP) tunnel that is being torn down. No specific attacker capabilities or positions are needed as the condition is triggered as part of normal kernel behavior in a specific scenario.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities or positions are required. The vulnerability is triggered as a result of normal network operations."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The fix involves two changes:\n\n1.  Use `rcu_dereference_sk_user_data()` in `fou_from_sock()` to safely access the socket's user data under RCU protection, preventing use-after-free issues.\n2. Add NULL checks in FOU GRO handlers `fou_gro_receive`, `fou_gro_complete`, and `gue_gro_receive` to ensure `sk->sk_user_data` (now referred to as `fou`) is not NULL before dereferencing it.",
