We believe there is immense value in having a bug bounty program as part of our cybersecurity strategy, and we encourage all companies, not just those in the hospitality industry, to take a similar approach and consider bug bounty as a proactive security initiative.

Our first pentests revealed a major finding and showed the value of an ethical hacker community combined with PTaaS. Today, our pentests give us full visibility into findings in real-time, allowing us to pivot to fix and retest while the pentest is still running. The result is that we have more trust in the final report and can plan to direct efforts immediately to any weak spots.
