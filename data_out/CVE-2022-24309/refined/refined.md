Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24309:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from cert-portal.siemens.com explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-24309: XPath Constraint Vulnerability in Mendix Runtime" and describes the vulnerability, its impact, and affected versions of Mendix Runtime. The content is related to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the Mendix Runtime's failure, in some cases, to properly apply XPath constraint checks when parsing associations for entities with readable associations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper Access Control (CWE-284) leading to the bypass of XPath constraints.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A malicious user could deduce the content of attributes that are supposed to be inaccessible.
    *   A malicious user could modify sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks (AV:N).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs low privileges (PR:L).
    *   Attacker action requires high attack complexity (AC:H)
    *   No user interaction needed (UI:N).

**3. Additional Details**
    * The vulnerability primarily affects Mendix Runtime versions 7 and 8.
    * For Mendix Runtime 9, the vulnerability only occurs in versions prior to 9.13 and only when the `DataStorage.UseNewQueryHandler` setting is set to `False`. It's worth noting that versions 9.13 and later have addressed this by making the new query handler the default, thus mitigating the issue if a default or later version is being used.

**4. Mitigations:**

*   The primary mitigation is to update to the specified versions of Mendix Runtime:
    *   V7.23.29 or later for Mendix Runtime V7.
    *   V8.18.16 or later for Mendix Runtime V8.
    *   V9.13 or later for Mendix Runtime V9, or set the `DataStorage.UseNewQueryHandler` runtime custom setting to `True`.
*   General security measures, such as protecting network access, are also recommended.

**5. CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.8 (Medium severity)
*   CVSS v3.1 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High)
    *   **A:N** (Availability Impact: None)
    *   **E:P** (Exploit Code Maturity: Proof-of-Concept)
    *   **RL:O** (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    *   **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed)

**6. Source Content Details**
The other content provided from docs.mendix.com is primarily documentation on Mendix products and release notes and does not directly relate to the vulnerability details.

In summary, the vulnerability allows for improper access control using specially crafted XPath queries, and requires the application to be a Mendix version earlier than the stated fixed version. Exploitation can lead to the viewing or modification of sensitive data. The primary mitigation is to update to a patched version of the Mendix Runtime or apply the runtime custom setting, if on an earlier 9.x version, as described.
