```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `SatisAlt` parameter within the `Json.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection (SQLi). The application is vulnerable to boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can view and steal sensitive database information by exploiting this vulnerability.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to the `/Y/Moduller/_Urun/Json.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `SatisAlt` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or a privileged user. The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a tool like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.
