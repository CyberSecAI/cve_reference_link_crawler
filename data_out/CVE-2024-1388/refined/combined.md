### Description

The Yuki theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the reset\_customizer\_options() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to reset the theme's settings.
