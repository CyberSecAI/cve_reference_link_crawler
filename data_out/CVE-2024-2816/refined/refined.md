- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tenda AC15 V15.03.05.18 router has a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `fromSysToolReboot` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can reboot the device, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted GET request to the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to make the request, typically via a malicious link or website. The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows a direct request to the vulnerable endpoint, but in real exploitation, the request would need to be triggered by a user's browser while authenticated to the router's web interface.
