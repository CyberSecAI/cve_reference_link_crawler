Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The crash occurs due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing memory at address 0x000000000040, which is close to the null pointer address and indicates a read operation on invalid memory. This happens within the `std::vector<unsigned int>::size()` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The issue is triggered when attempting to get the size of a `std::vector<unsigned int>` within the `SingleItemTypeReferenceBox::getToItemIds()` function. The stack trace shows that this is happening when parsing an item in a HEIF file using the `HevcImageFileReader`, which suggests a flaw in how the code handles metadata within HEIF files.
-  The provided crash sample likely has an invalid structure causing the vector to be in a state that accessing the size triggers the SEGV, which may point to a missing check for valid data before accessing the vector size.
- A key weakness lies in the lack of proper bounds checking or handling of invalid data within the HEIF parsing logic, especially concerning the `ItemReferenceBox`, or the logic surrounding it which leads to the creation of invalid vectors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) as the application crashes (SEGV). This crash can be triggered by a specially crafted HEIF file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malformed HEIF file that, when processed by the `tifig` tool, triggers the segmentation fault.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to provide a specially crafted HEIF file, typically as an argument to the `tifig` command-line tool. No special privileges or network access are required.

**Additional details:**
- The stack trace highlights that the `std::vector` is being accessed improperly within the context of processing a specific HEIF file structure (item references), indicating a parsing error in `lib/heif/Srcs/common/itemreferencebox.cpp` specifically in `SingleItemTypeReferenceBox::getToItemIds()`.
- The crash report includes the provided sample file `id13_SEGV_in_size.zip`, which can be used to reproduce the issue.

This information reveals that CVE-2022-36153 is likely related to an exploitable crash in the `tifig` tool when processing specially crafted HEIF files due to improper handling of metadata leading to an invalid `std::vector` state that causes a SEGV.
