- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Electrolink device relies on cookies for authentication, and these cookies are not properly validated or checked for integrity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking (CWE-565). Specifically, an unauthenticated attacker can modify the cookie to reveal hidden pages allowing critical operations to the transmitter.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can gain access to hidden pages that allow more critical operations on the transmitter.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to manipulate the cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
