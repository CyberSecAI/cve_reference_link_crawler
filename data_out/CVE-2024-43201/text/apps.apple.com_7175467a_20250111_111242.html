### Fitness

> I just joined planet fitness and so far I have been treated with the most respect. I left workout anytime to come here since the lady up front at workout anytime was very rude to me and wouldnât allow me to bring my daughter with me to workout. People want to go someone where they feel wanted , not somewhere where they feel like they arenât welcome and told your back again , like what does it matter if someone comes back when their a member and havenât done anything wrong. I could understand if I damaged something or did something but none of that have I done at workout anytime I have felt more welcome at Planet fitness then workout anytime. All I had to do yesterday was call planet fitness and the guy up front told me I was welcome to come with my daughter. The only suggestion I have for planet fitness is on the app putting a place for pictures to be took inside the app. To keep track of your progress. Other then that I have enjoyed it at planet fitness and was thankful to the staff who aloud me to be a guest before I joined!

### The crowd meter is useless

> I havenât tested out everything else on the app; I do my own workout and Iâm sure there are MANY amazing tools for people and the crowd meter is just one tiny thing compared to the vast ways this app can benefit your workout, HOWEVER: I think itâs a big deal since I bet EVERYONE looks at it and regardless of how a person works out, NO ONE likes working out in a gym thatâs too crowded; thatâs universal and I WOULD be using this feature all the time if it were actually accurate.
>
> The crowd meter on the app is deceptive and stupid. I was there the other day with two bars and it was pretty busy. I had to wait to use some equipment, and at that point I checked again and it had 3 bars. It never filled in more bars than that though. So by this logic 4 bars should be maxed out; or 5 bars MAYBE if there are like, lines to use everything! Why would it go up to TEN BARS and make us think it isnât busy! The fact that PF tries to make it LOOK like it isnât very busy renders the whole thing useless and deceptive.
>
> I thought it was a neat feature that Iâd use a lot when I signed up, but now I see itâs only a marketing ploy and PF is a lot busier than anyone would ever want. You should be truthful about it and 3 bars should really be around 7. Or change it to 5 bars being the max. Either way, the way itâs set up now with 10 bars and only having it at 2-3 all week long is misleading and pointless.

### No Fitness Class Available!

> There has been the problem with some of the PF locations not offering training classes due to the staff failing to hire trainers although they advertise that they offer them for members which is included as part of their membership. However members are aware that they are paying for this service out of their monthly fees and/or from the annual fees theyâre being charged for at the location where they signed up. Apparently, it has been weeks, if not months with no available fitness coaches throughout the LA locations. Who do we report this to? Perhaps the district managers? It just seems that they are not seeking or hiring them out of due diligence and rather letting this part of the job slip. Also their app lets you schedule the appointment times with the opening slots even though there are no trainers available for those times at all. Goodness, that is misleading. The staff are aware of this issue yet they donât seem to take this up to the corporate. If they did the it shouldâve been somewhat fixed by now. However if you donât have coaches at your locations, let the members be aware of it by posting signs at the gym so they know the current update. Weâd love to see those classes to become available with what theyâre claiming on the PF website!
