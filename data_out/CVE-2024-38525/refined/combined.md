# Malformed unicode header values may throw uncaught exception

Moderate

[bm1549](/bm1549)
published
GHSA-rf3p-mg22-qv6w
Jun 27, 2024

## Package

dd-trace-cpp

## Affected versions

v0.1.12, v0.2.0, v0.2.1

## Patched versions

v0.2.2

## Description

### Summary

When the `dd-trace-cpp` library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, the library attempts to log the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. This attempted logging may throw an uncaught exception.

### Details

The code that introduced this logging was added in pull request [#72](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/72) and has been present in versions [v0.1.12](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.1.12), [v0.2.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.0), and [v0.2.1](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.1).

For each key and value in the list of audited headers, a nlohmann::json instance is created as follows:

```
stream << nlohmann::json(it->first + ": " + it->second);

```

Here, `it->first` is the header name and `it->second` is the value. This code is problematic for several reasons:

* An exception can be thrown by the JSON library while parsing the input.
* An exception can be thrown by the implicit call to `dump()`.

### Impact

This impacts any downstream applications that rely on `dd-trace-cpp` for tracing.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in `dd-trace-cpp` version [v0.2.2](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.2) ([#132](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/pull/132))

### Workarounds

* Filter out header values that are not valid UTF-8 strings

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
