Hello gophers,

Version v0.0.0-20220315160706-3147a52a75dd of [golang.org/x/crypto/ssh](http://golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) implements client authentication support for signature algorithms based on SHA-2 for use with existing RSA keys.

Previously, a client would fail to authenticate with RSA keys to servers that reject signature algorithms based on SHA-1. This includes [OpenSSH 8.8](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8) by default and—[starting today March 15, 2022](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-03-15-removed-unencrypted-git-protocol-and-certain-ssh-keys/)—[github.com](http://github.com) for recently uploaded keys.

We are providing this announcement as the error (“ssh: unable to authenticate”) might otherwise be difficult to troubleshoot.

Version v0.0.0-20220314234659-1baeb1ce4c0b (included in the version above) also fixes a potential security issue where an attacker could cause a crash in a [golang.org/x/crypto/ssh](http://golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) server under these conditions:

* The server has been configured by passing a [Signer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#Signer) to [ServerConfig.AddHostKey](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#ServerConfig.AddHostKey).
* The Signer passed to AddHostKey does not also implement [AlgorithmSigner](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#AlgorithmSigner).
* The Signer passed to AddHostKey does return a key of type “ssh-rsa” from its PublicKey method.

Servers that only use Signer implementations provided by the ssh package are unaffected. This is CVE-2022-27191.

Alla prossima,

Filippo for the Go Security team
