- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user with write access to the email alerts page can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email alert template, which is then executed when the template is previewed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided data in the email alert template preview.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. The confidentiality impact is rated as high.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the SNS (Stormshield Network Security) device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires high privileges with write access to the email alerts page. User interaction is required to preview the crafted alert email, and the scope is unchanged, meaning the vulnerability only affects the user's session.
