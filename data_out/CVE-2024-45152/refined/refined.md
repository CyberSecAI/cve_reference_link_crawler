- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack does not require any special privileges (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R). The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need local access to the system, and the user would need to open a specially crafted file or perform some other specific user interaction.
