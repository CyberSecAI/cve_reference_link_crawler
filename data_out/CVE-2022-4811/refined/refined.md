The provided content is a commit diff from the `usememos/memos` repository on GitHub. It addresses access control issues, specifically focusing on sanitizing the `CreatorID` field. The commit removes the `json:"-"` tag from `CreatorID` in several API structs, which might expose internal creator IDs when they shouldn't be, therefore fixing an access control issue.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit addresses an access control vulnerability stemming from the potential exposure of internal `CreatorID` values through the API responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the unintended exposure of `CreatorID` through JSON responses. Before the commit, the `CreatorID` field was not explicitly excluded in API response structs, potentially revealing this ID when data was serialized into JSON.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker gaining access to the `CreatorID` could potentially gain internal knowledge of data relationships. The full impact is highly dependent on the application's business logic.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves intercepting or analyzing the API responses that inadvertently expose the `CreatorID` field in JSON format.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to intercept and analyze API responses from the Memos application. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Access to server logs or other information where API responses are logged.
- Access to client applications that expose this data.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The commit also addresses some typos in server/auth.go:  "signin" should be "sign in".
*   The commit changes many files within the API directory, modifying struct definitions related to `memo`, `memo_organizer`, `memo_resource`, `resource`, `shortcut`, `tag`, and `user_setting`, consistently removing the  `json:"-"`  tag from the `CreatorID` field.
*  The commit also changes the `MemoFind` struct to no longer accept `json:"id"` which could be an additional access control fix.
