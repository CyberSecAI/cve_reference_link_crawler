# Vulnerability Report

## Summary

There exists a path traversal vulnerability in the `/<path:url>/<path:filename>` route. This occurs as attacker controlled values are used directly in the `send_from_directory` call.

The vulnerability can be attributed to the following block of code.

[BaiduWenkuSpider\_flaskWeb/GetAll.py](https://github.com/ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb/blob/12479447a02811f2b89ed339dd0b1334e7aad9fe/GetAll.py#L697-L700)

Lines 697 to 700
in
[1247944](/ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb/commit/12479447a02811f2b89ed339dd0b1334e7aad9fe)

|  | @app.route("/<path:url>/<path:filename>") |
| --- | --- |
|  | def downloader(url,filename): |
|  | dirpath = os.path.join(app.root\_path, url) # 下载文件目录路径 |
|  | return send\_from\_directory(dirpath, filename, as\_attachment=True) # as\_attachment=True 一定要写，不然会变成打开，而不是下载 |

`os.path.join` call is not safe when used with untrusted input. It does not behave well when linux and windows file schemes are mixed and can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Remediation

The code in this PR should fix the underlying issue.

## GitHub Security Advisories

If possible, please could you create a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for these findings?

When you use a GitHub Security Advisory, you can request a CVE identification number from GitHub. GitHub usually reviews the request within 72 hours, and the CVE details will be published after you make your security advisory public. Publishing a GitHub Security Advisory and a CVE will help notify the downstream consumers of your project, so they can update to the fixed version.

Sorry, something went wrong.
