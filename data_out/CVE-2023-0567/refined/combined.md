# BCrypt hashes erroneously validate if the salt is cut short by `$`

## Description

### Summary

Malformatted BCrypt hashes that include a `$` within their salt part will trigger a buffer overread and may erroneously validate any password as valid.

### Details

Example:

```
<?php
var_dump(password_verify("foo", '$2y$04$00000000$')); // bool(true)
?>
```

This issue is caused by a PHP specific modification to the crypt\_blowfish implementation that is fittingly named “PHP hack”:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L374)

Line 374
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | if (tmp == '$') break; /\* PHP hack \*/ \ |
| --- | --- |

The “hack” will allow a salt that is cut short by `$` to be detected as valid and allowing it to proceed with the algorithm. At the end the original `setting`, which is properly NUL terminated, will be copied into the output buffer:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L763)

Line 763
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | memcpy(output, setting, 7 + 22 - 1); |
| --- | --- |

which is then used to initialize the returned `zend_string` by leveraging `strlen()` and thus cutting the string short after the `setting`:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt.c#L137)

Line 137
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | result = zend\_string\_init(output, strlen(output), 0); |
| --- | --- |

… thus returning the original input.

Furthermore a buffer overread of the `setting` input may be triggered when copying the `setting` into the output buffer, because the `memcpy` uses fixed sizes, even if the `setting` might be too short:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L763)

Line 763
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | memcpy(output, setting, 7 + 22 - 1); |
| --- | --- |

### Suggested Fix

The suggested fix would be removing the “PHP Hack” and thus the differences between PHP's crypt\_blowfish and Openwall’s implementation which is the basis of PHP’s implementation.

The “PHP Hack” exists since the very first version of PHP’s own crypt\_blowfish implementation and no clear reasoning is given for its existence in the commentary or commit history. In any case such a hash is not a valid BCrypt hash and it is not generated by `password_hash()`, which is the recommended password hashing API in PHP.

While this technically might break backwards compatibility with existing users, the fact that these hashes are never generated by `password_hash()`, are not accepted by other implementations of BCrypt and introduce possible security vulnerabilities in applications, they should be rejected in every supported PHP version.

### PoC

Running the following in valgrind:

```
<?php
var_dump(password_verify("foo", '$2y$04$00000000$')); // bool(true)
?>
```

results in:

I able to login without password when password_verify is used and a bad hash is stored in database.  see test script for a evil hash example. There is other forms of magic hash with the same consequence.   seen on many version of php on linux (maybe present on other system). perhaps a bigger security problem in the underlying code.   Test script: --------------- <?php  $pass_rand = rand(1,999).'test'.rand(1,999); echo $pass_rand. ':'; echo (password_verify($pass_rand , '$2y$10$am$2y$10$am')) ? 'OK' : 'FAIL';;    ``` PatchesPull Requests Pull requests:  * [Ignore externally managed and generated files](https://github.com/php/web-windows/pull/21)   (web-windows/21) HistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2023-01-05 13:05 UTC] [ondrej@php.net](//people.php.net/ondrej)** ``` The documentation for `password_verify()` clearly states that the `$hash` has to be valid:  > hash > A hash created by password_hash().  I fail to see how this is a bug if you feed it garbage; also the documentation to crypt states:  > Using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt() to return a zero-length string. The two digit cost parameter is the base-2 logarithm of the iteration count for the underlying Blowfish-based hashing algorithm and must be in range 04-31, values outside this range will cause crypt() to fail.  PHP clearly behaves as described.  ``` **[2023-01-06 10:58 UTC] tech at mkdgs dot fr** ``` Sorry, i don't clearly see it in documentation: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php>  I don't think this is clear (and maybe for many developer too) Many solution fail with that if an attacker put this kind of hash in db (via sql injection)  At least clearly update the documentation about this point. And i think, but it's my point of view, this function must be simple as possible too avoid security problem.  Ok, it's not a bug it's a feature, but for now you can validate an access with a bad hash, it's not very intuitive. I agree, the hash is not valid, but why not checking the hash ??  If it's for performance reason, let an option for not checking it. But make this function simple.    <?php  var_dump(PHP_OS); $pass_rand = rand(1,999).'test'.rand(1,999);  echo (password_verify($pass_rand , '$2y$10$am$2y$10$am')) ? 'Password match hash' : 'FAIL Password not match hash'; echo "\r"; echo ( password_hash($pass_rand, PASSWORD_DEFAULT) === '$2y$10$am$2y$10$am' ) ? 'OK: Hash match' : 'Fail: Hash not match';  ``` **[2023-01-23 14:20 UTC] [cmb@php.net](//people.php.net/cmb)** ``` From the RFC which introduced the password functions[1]:  | When passed a correct password and the generated hash from | password_hash(), the function will return a boolean true. If there | is any failure (hash is invalid, password is incorrect, hash is | corrupted, etc), the function will return a boolean false.  So according to that statement, the current behavior is a bug.  > […], values outside this range will cause crypt() to fail.  Hmm:  php > var_dump(crypt("foo", '$2y$10$am$2y$10$am')); string(18) "$2y$10$am$2y$10$am"  How is the programmer supposed to know that this is a failure return?  Ah, the return values section clarifies:  | Returns the hashed string or a string that is shorter than 13 | characters and is guaranteed to differ from the salt on failure.  Okay.  Still, I fail to see why password_verify() returns true, while crypt() fails for the same broken salt/hash.  Furthermore, it seems that password_verify() fails for broken argon2 hashes.  And when I look at the implementation of php_password_bcrypt_verify() in ext/standard/password.c:  	zend_string *ret = php_crypt(ZSTR_VAL(password), (int)ZSTR_LEN(password), ZSTR_VAL(hash), (int)ZSTR_LEN(hash), 1);  	if (!ret) { 		return 0; 	}  	if (ZSTR_LEN(hash) < 13) { 		zend_string_free(ret); 		return 0; 	}  I see that we are checking whether the length is less than 13 characters, but we do not check that the hash is returned unmodified.
