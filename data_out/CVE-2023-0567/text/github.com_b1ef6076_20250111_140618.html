# BCrypt hashes erroneously validate if the salt is cut short by `$`

## Description

### Summary

Malformatted BCrypt hashes that include a `$` within their salt part will trigger a buffer overread and may erroneously validate any password as valid.

### Details

Example:

```
<?php
var_dump(password_verify("foo", '$2y$04$00000000$')); // bool(true)
?>
```

This issue is caused by a PHP specific modification to the crypt\_blowfish implementation that is fittingly named “PHP hack”:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L374)

Line 374
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | if (tmp == '$') break; /\* PHP hack \*/ \ |
| --- | --- |

The “hack” will allow a salt that is cut short by `$` to be detected as valid and allowing it to proceed with the algorithm. At the end the original `setting`, which is properly NUL terminated, will be copied into the output buffer:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L763)

Line 763
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | memcpy(output, setting, 7 + 22 - 1); |
| --- | --- |

which is then used to initialize the returned `zend_string` by leveraging `strlen()` and thus cutting the string short after the `setting`:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt.c#L137)

Line 137
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | result = zend\_string\_init(output, strlen(output), 0); |
| --- | --- |

… thus returning the original input.

Furthermore a buffer overread of the `setting` input may be triggered when copying the `setting` into the output buffer, because the `memcpy` uses fixed sizes, even if the `setting` might be too short:

[php-src/ext/standard/crypt\_blowfish.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a/ext/standard/crypt_blowfish.c#L763)

Line 763
in
[2740920](/php/php-src/commit/2740920a392c043b034e2f0e41d819549836712a)

|  | memcpy(output, setting, 7 + 22 - 1); |
| --- | --- |

### Suggested Fix

The suggested fix would be removing the “PHP Hack” and thus the differences between PHP's crypt\_blowfish and Openwall’s implementation which is the basis of PHP’s implementation.

The “PHP Hack” exists since the very first version of PHP’s own crypt\_blowfish implementation and no clear reasoning is given for its existence in the commentary or commit history. In any case such a hash is not a valid BCrypt hash and it is not generated by `password_hash()`, which is the recommended password hashing API in PHP.

While this technically might break backwards compatibility with existing users, the fact that these hashes are never generated by `password_hash()`, are not accepted by other implementations of BCrypt and introduce possible security vulnerabilities in applications, they should be rejected in every supported PHP version.

### PoC

Running the following in valgrind:

```
<?php
var_dump(password_verify("foo", '$2y$04$00000000$')); // bool(true)
?>
```

results in:
