- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization when creating a new user account, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize user-provided first and last names, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the user profile or search for the affected user. This can lead to account takeover, as the attacker can steal session cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker creates a new user account using crafted first and last names containing malicious scripts.
    - The malicious script is stored in the application's database
    - When other users view the user or perform a search, the script is executed in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a new account on the affected application.
    - No additional capabilities or network position are required to exploit the stored XSS. Any user accessing the user information will trigger the vulnerability.
