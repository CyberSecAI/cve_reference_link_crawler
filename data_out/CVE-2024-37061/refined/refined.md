- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `_run_entry_point` function in `projects/backend/local.py` uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute commands defined in the `MLproject` file. This function constructs the command to be executed by directly using the command string defined in the MLproject file, which allows for arbitrary code injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection via command execution. Lack of sanitization or validation of user-provided commands in the `MLproject` file leads to arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. An attacker can execute any OS-level command, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious `MLproject` file that contains a malicious command in the `entry_points` section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `MLproject` file to the victim. The victim needs to execute `mlflow run` from within the directory containing the malicious `MLproject` file for exploitation to occur.
