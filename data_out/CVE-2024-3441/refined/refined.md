Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application directly incorporates user input from the `txtphone` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied data is directly embedded into the SQL query without adequate escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Data breach or exfiltration
    *   Data modification or deletion
    *   Potential system compromise

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/Employee/edit-profile.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `txtphone`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/Employee/edit-profile.php` page. This requires network access to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the application and the vulnerable endpoint. The provided credentials `releaseme@gmail.com/escobar2012` could facilitate this, but this is not required to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability, as it exists in the `edit-profile.php` endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is in the `edit-profile.php` file. The SQL query is constructed using string concatenation, directly inserting the `$_POST['txtphone']` value into the SQL query:
    ```php
    $sql = " update tblemployee set fullname='" . $_POST['txtfullname'] . "',sex='" . $_POST['cmdsex'] . "',dob='" . $_POST['txtdob'] . "',phone='" . $_POST['txtphone'] . "',address='" . $_POST['txtaddress'] . "',qualification='" . $_POST['txtqualification'] . "',dept='" . $_POST['cmddept'] . "',employee_type='" . $_POST['cmdemployeetype'] . "',date_appointment='" . $_POST['txtappointment'] . "',basic_salary='" . $_POST['txtbasic_salary'] . "',gross_pay='" . $_POST['txtgross_pay'] . "' where email='$email'";
    ```
*   The SQL injection can be confirmed using sqlmap, as demonstrated in the provided proof of concept.

The information provided is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes a specific code snippet, details on the attack vector, and a proof of concept using `sqlmap`.
