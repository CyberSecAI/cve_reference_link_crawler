{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2024-27419",
  "description": "The provided data indicates a fix for a data race condition in the netrom module of the Linux kernel. This is achieved by adding READ_ONCE to sysctl_netrom_reset_circuit.",
  "affected_component": "netrom module of the Linux kernel",
  "root_cause": "Data race condition due to concurrent access to the sysctl_netrom_reset_circuit variable without proper synchronization.",
  "weakness": "The lack of proper synchronization mechanisms while accessing shared resources (sysctl_netrom_reset_circuit), leading to data races.",
    "impact": "The specific impact is not detailed in this data, but data races can lead to undefined behavior, such as kernel crashes, incorrect logic execution, or potentially privilege escalation or information leaks if the race allows for an attacker to manipulate the system state.",
  "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent read and write access to the `sysctl_netrom_reset_circuit` variable, which is a global kernel configuration option, the exact attack vector depends on how the configuration can be changed.  The provided data does not describe exactly how to trigger, but it can likely be changed through sysctl interfaces.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to trigger the concurrent access to the sysctl_netrom_reset_circuit variable and change the value at an opportune moment.  This often implies some level of access to the system to affect changes to sysctl configuration.   The exact requirement depends on whether this value can be changed by normal users or if root or other elevated privilege is needed.  The information is not included in the provided data."
