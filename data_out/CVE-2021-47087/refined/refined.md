Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47087.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect page free operation within the OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) driver. During the allocation of shared memory pages, the `page` pointer was incorrectly incremented as pages were assigned to an array. When freeing the memory, the modified `page` pointer was used which would then cause the freeing of arbitrary memory instead of the allocated pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect pointer arithmetic: The code modified the `page` pointer as it iterated through the allocated pages. This led to `__free_pages` being called with a pointer that did not point to the start of the allocated memory region.
- Arbitrary memory free: Due to the incorrect `page` pointer, the code could free arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Freeing arbitrary memory could lead to memory corruption, which can cause a system crash or other unpredictable behavior.
- Potential for privilege escalation: Though not explicitly stated in the provided text, memory corruption bugs can sometimes be leveraged by attackers for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `tee` subsystem, specifically within the OP-TEE driver's shared memory management functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the `pool_op_alloc` function in the TEE driver and then cause the shared memory to be freed. This typically involves interaction with the TEE. The specifics of how an attacker would achieve this depend on the system and its configuration.
