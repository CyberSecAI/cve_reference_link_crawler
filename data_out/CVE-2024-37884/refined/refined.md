{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks when accessing old versions of files in Nextcloud. Specifically, users with only read permissions on a shared file were able to send delete requests for older versions of that file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control, specifically missing permission checks for file version deletion. This falls under CWE-284: Improper Access Control.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can delete old versions of files even if they only have read-only permissions to the current version of the file. This can lead to a loss of data availability, as older versions of files are deleted by an unauthorized user.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network based attack, where a user with read-only access can send a delete request to the server for an older version of a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Nextcloud instance and must have been granted read-only access to the current version of a file. They must then be able to send a request to the server."
