{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PQUIC server does not discard unused encryption keys after moving to a new encryption level. Specifically, the Initial key should be discarded after moving to the Handshake encryption level, and the Handshake key after moving to the 1-RTT encryption level.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Retention of unused encryption keys, specifically the Initial key and Handshake key, after moving to higher encryption levels.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who obtains the Initial key (e.g., by capturing Initial packets) can disrupt the connection by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in an Initial packet, causing a connection close that is not initiated by either the client or the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Capturing the Initial packets between client and server, then injecting crafted Initial packets with a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic during the connection establishment phase to obtain the initial key, and then needs to be able to inject packets."
