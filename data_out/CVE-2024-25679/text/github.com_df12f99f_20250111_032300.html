### **[QUICTester](/QUICTester)** commented [Jul 18, 2023](#issue-1809084301) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

| Hi,  During testing commit [841c822](https://github.com/p-quic/pquic/commit/841c82289b23d32c28723a0175654ecc6baeae08), we discovered that the PQUIC server does not discard the unused encryption keys after moving to a new encryption level.  The unused encryption keys, such as the Initial key, should be discarded once QUIC has moved to the Handshake encryption level ([https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#name-discarding-unused-keys](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/YMnhCoV140cqgmpYT1SLTK?domain=rfc-editor.org)), same as the Handshake key after moving to the 1-RTT encryption level. An attacker can obtain the Initial key by capturing the Initial packets sent between the client and server during the connection establishment. If the server/client still accepts and processes Initial packets at any encryption level, an attacker can disrupt the connection by sending a CONNECTION\_CLOSE frame in an Initial packet to the server/client, causing a connection close that is not initiated by either the client or the server. |

| Yes, the server is not retaining any unused keys in the fix. |
