### Description

The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure of a WordPress site's database due to missing capability checks on the wp\_ajax\_wpvivid\_add\_remote AJAX action that allows low-level authenticated attackers to send back-ups to a remote location of their choice for review.

Wordfence blocked **4 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
