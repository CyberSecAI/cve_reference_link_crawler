The Migration, Backup, Staging â€“ WPvivid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure of a WordPress site's database due to missing capability checks on the wp_ajax_wpvivid_add_remote AJAX action that allows low-level authenticated attackers to send back-ups to a remote location of their choice for review. This affects versions up to, and including 0.9.35.
