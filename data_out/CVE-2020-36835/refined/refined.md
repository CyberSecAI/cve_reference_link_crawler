Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36835:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-36835. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions the CVE ID, and the description of the vulnerability aligns with the information found in the plugin's code changes.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in the `wp_ajax_wpvivid_add_remote` AJAX action within the WPvivid Backup plugin. This allows any authenticated user, even with low-level privileges, to initiate a backup and send it to a remote storage location of their choice.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The core issue is that the `wp_ajax_wpvivid_add_remote` action does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the backup and remote storage configuration.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  The ability to trigger a backup and send it to a remote location means an attacker can exfiltrate a copy of the entire WordPress database (and potentially other files) to a location they control.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** The most significant impact is the exposure of sensitive information contained within the WordPress database. This includes user data, website content, and configuration settings.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The stolen database can be used to gain further access to the website, other systems, or to target users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a malicious AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_wpvivid_add_remote` action.
*   **Remote Storage Configuration:** An attacker can configure a remote storage location under their control via the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site. Even a low-level user role is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details from the Code Changes (beyond the CVE description):**

*   **Nonce Verification:** The code changes show the addition of a nonce check for ajax requests. This is a security measure to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks. This suggests that before the patch, the endpoint was also vulnerable to CSRF in addition to the missing capability check.
*   **Parameter Sanitization:** The changeset also introduces sanitization for the `url` parameter in the `wpvivid_send_to_site_connect` function, using `strtok($_POST['url'],'?')`.
*   **Premium Tab:** The code changes also add a "Premium" tab, and ajax nonce to other plugin actions.
*   **Other Functions with Ajax check:** The changes also add nonce verification to `wpvivid_download_website_info`,`wpvivid_download`,`wpvivid_export_settings`,`wpvivid_upload_files`,`wpvivid_upload_files_finish`,`rescan_local_folder_set_backup`,`get_backup_count`, `wpvivid_download_export`,`export_post_step2`,`export_post_step3`,`get_list`,`get_export_list`, `get_list_page`, `prepare_export_post`,`list_tasks`,`delete_export_list`,`check_import_file`,`upload_import_files`,`upload_import_file_complete`,`clean_import_folder`, `wpvivid_scan_import_folder`,`get_import_list_page`,`send_to_site_connect`,`delete_transfer_key`,`export_download_backup`, `migrate_now`, `task_monitor_ex`, `add_remote`, `hide_mainwp_tab_page`, `hide_wp_cron_notice`
*   **Code Refactoring**: The code changes refactors the `replace_string` function in `class-wpvivid-restore-database.php` to `replace_string_v2`, where it will also try to replace the urls with or without the schema (`http://` or `https://`)
* **Other minor changes** There are multiple other minor changes made including to the schedule page, website info page, uninstall.php file, and the plugin description.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-36835 highlights a critical vulnerability due to inadequate access controls in the WPvivid Backup plugin. It allowed low-privileged authenticated users to exfiltrate a WordPress site's database by sending it to a remote location under their control. The patch, version 0.9.36, addresses this issue by adding capability checks and nonce verification, and sanitization.
