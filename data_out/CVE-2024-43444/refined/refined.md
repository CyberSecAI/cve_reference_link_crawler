The provided content is a security advisory for OTRS, and it includes details about CVE-2024-43444.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Passwords of agents and customers are written in plain text to the OTRS admin log module. This occurs when specific configurations related to authentication sources are combined with enabled debugging for the authentication backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The vulnerability lies in logging sensitive password data in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   CAPEC-545: Pull Data from System Resources. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to user passwords by accessing the admin logs if the system is configured with vulnerable settings and debugging enabled. This could lead to unauthorized account access and further compromise of the system or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the OTRS system's admin log module (either through direct access, or potentially through exploiting other vulnerabilities) could retrieve the plaintext passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the OTRS system's admin log module. This could mean having administrative credentials or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access.
- The vulnerability is present only when specific authentication configurations are used in combination with debugging being enabled for the authentication backend.

**Affected Products:**
-   OTRS: Versions 7.0.x through 7.0.50, 8.0.x, 2023.x, and 2024.x through 2024.5.x.
