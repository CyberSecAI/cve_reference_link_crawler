- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization on the 'title' parameter in the `add.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `title` parameter in the `add.php` file using HTTP POST requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and the server must be accessible to the attacker. The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
