    -  Other malicious activities depending on the context of the injection.
- The impact is rated as moderate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to VMware Cloud Director Availability is required.
- An attacker can craft malicious HTML tags.
- This crafted HTML is injected within replication tasks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the VMware Cloud Director Availability system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject this HTML into replication tasks.
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 6.4.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.7.2 of VMware Cloud Director Availability.
