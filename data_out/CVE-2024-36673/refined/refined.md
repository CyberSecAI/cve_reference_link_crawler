The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36673.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `login.php` file of the "Pharmacy/Medical Store Point of Sale System" due to direct use of user-supplied inputs (`$_POST['email']` and `$_POST['password']`) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection:  The code directly embeds user inputs into the SQL query without sanitization or using parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating the `email` parameter in the login form to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `login.php` file. No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques, including boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind injections.
- Specific payloads for exploiting the vulnerability are provided, such as:
  - `email=-4156' OR 1214=1214-- DSCn&password=123&login=`
  - `email=111@qq.com' OR ROW(5293,9929)>(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a7a7a71,(SELECT (ELT(5293=5293,1))),0x71706b6a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM (SELECT 8662 UNION SELECT 9796 UNION SELECT 9505 UNION SELECT 3269)a GROUP BY x)-- ahqP&password=123&login=`
  - `email=111@qq.com' AND (SELECT 8848 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))zeUx)-- fOou&password=123&login=`
- The content provides screenshots of `sqlmap` being used to exploit the vulnerability and dump database information.
- The suggested fix is to use prepared statements with parameter binding instead of directly embedding user inputs into SQL queries.
