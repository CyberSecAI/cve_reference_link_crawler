- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protections for the web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability in the web UI, allowing an attacker to perform actions with administrative privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack allows an attacker to perform actions with *Administrator* privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated administrator to click a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious link to an authenticated administrator of the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard. The vulnerable web UI is running on the management network.
