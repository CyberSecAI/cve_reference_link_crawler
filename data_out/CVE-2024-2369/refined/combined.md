## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks < 3.1.7 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Create/Edit a Post, add an "Icon" block and put the following payload in the "Link Settings > Link URL: " field: 123" onmouseover='alert(/XSS/)'
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/previewing the post and moving the mouse over the icon

### Affects Plugins
