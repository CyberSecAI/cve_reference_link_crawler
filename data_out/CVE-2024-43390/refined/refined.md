The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43390.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input validation within the `FW_NAT.IN_IP` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper injection (CWE-74). The application fails to properly sanitize input in the `FW_NAT.IN_IP` environment variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A low-privileged remote attacker can exploit this to perform configuration changes of firewall services, specifically packet forwarding or NAT, which can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote exploitation is possible by injecting malicious input through the `FW_NAT.IN_IP` environment variable within the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
A low-privileged remote attacker with access to the administrative interface of the affected Phoenix Contact mGuard devices is required to exploit this vulnerability.
