- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The root cause is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, stemming from improper handling of user input leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack vector. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low-privileged attacker, a user with the ability to save content into AEM, can inject malicious scripts that get stored in the system and later executed on other users' browsers. User interaction is required for the exploit to trigger.
