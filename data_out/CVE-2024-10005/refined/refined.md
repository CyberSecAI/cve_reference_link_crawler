- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of path normalization in Consul's L7 traffic intentions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  URL-encoded paths and/or multiple slashes in HTTP requests are not properly normalized, leading to bypass of path-based access rules defined in L7 intentions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass intended access controls defined in L7 intentions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to services or resources.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability involves crafting HTTP requests with manipulated paths (URL-encoded or containing multiple slashes) that are not normalized by Consul.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to services protected by Consul L7 intentions and have knowledge of the configured path-based access rules.
