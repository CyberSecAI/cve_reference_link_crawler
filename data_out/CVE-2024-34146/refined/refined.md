Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34146:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Git server Plugin lacks a permission check for read access to Git repositories accessed over SSH.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Missing authorization check: The plugin fails to verify if a user attempting to access a Git repository over SSH has the required "Overall/Read" permission.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access: Attackers with a previously configured SSH public key can gain read access to Git repositories even if they lack the necessary "Overall/Read" permission. This could expose sensitive information such as source code, configuration files, and other data stored in the repository.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access via SSH: The vulnerability is exploited through the SSH protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have a previously configured SSH public key that is authorized on the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker does not require "Overall/Read" permission.

**Summary:**

The Git server Plugin prior to version 117.veb_68868fa_027 allows users with a previously configured SSH key to access Git repositories over SSH even if they lack the required Overall/Read permissions. This lack of permission check allows unauthorized information disclosure.
