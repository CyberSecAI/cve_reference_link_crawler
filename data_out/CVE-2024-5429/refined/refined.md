- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Logo Slider plugin fails to properly validate and escape some of its Slider Settings before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Brand Name" field of a Logo Slider.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least the Contributor role in WordPress. They can create or edit a Logo Slider and insert the payload in the "Brand Name" field. The XSS is triggered when any user edits the slider.
