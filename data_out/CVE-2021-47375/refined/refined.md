Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47375.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the blktrace functionality of the Linux kernel. Specifically, it occurs when a blk_trace is removed via sysfs while still in the Blktrace_running state, leading to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the blktrace code. When a trace is stopped and freed, a race condition exists where another thread can still access the freed memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation leads to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, causing a denial of service (system crash). This is indicated by the provided kernel oops information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by the following steps:
    1.  Setting up blktrace on two block devices (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb).
    2.  Starting blktrace on both devices.
    3.  Disabling tracing on /dev/sdb via sysfs (`echo 0 > /sys/block/sdb/trace/enable`).
    4.  Triggering I/O on /dev/sda using `ioctl$SG_IO(/dev/sda, SG_IO, ...)`. The delay here is important to expose the race condition.
- The specific sysfs entry to trigger this is `/sys/block/sdb/trace/enable`.
- The ioctl calls and sysfs echo are the main attack vectors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute ioctl calls (specifically `BLKTRACESETUP`, `BLKTRACESTART`, and `SG_IO`) and write to sysfs files (specifically `/sys/block/<device>/trace/enable`). This generally means the attacker needs to be root or have capabilities to perform these actions.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a race condition, so timing and delays are important to trigger the vulnerability.

The provided patches resolve the issue by removing the blk\_trace from the running list before calling `blk_trace_free()`. They check if the `trace_state` is `Blktrace_running` and if so, changes the state, removes it from the list and flushes the relay channel before freeing the trace.
