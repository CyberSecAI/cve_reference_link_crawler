- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the parsing of IGS files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This results in a read before the start of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious IGS file, or by visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted IGS file to the victim or lure the victim to a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required.
