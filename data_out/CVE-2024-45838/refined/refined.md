**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin transmits callsigns in messages without encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):**  Callsigns, which can potentially contain sensitive information, are transmitted in cleartext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can intercept and read the unencrypted callsigns.
*   This could lead to a compromise of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be within radio range of the devices using the goTenna Pro ATAK plugin.
*   The attacker must be able to capture radio transmissions of devices utilizing vulnerable plugin versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in proximity (within radio range) to the affected devices.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to intercept radio communications.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document gives a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) and CVSS v4 score of 2.3 (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) for this vulnerability.
