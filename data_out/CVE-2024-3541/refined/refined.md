Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `/admin/admin_user.php` file of the Church Management System version 1.0. The `firstname` parameter of the specified file is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, specifically the `firstname` parameter, before reflecting it in the web page.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including:
  - Displaying inappropriate content.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Stealing user session cookies or sensitive information.
  - Downloading malware onto the victim's system.
  - Damaging the reputation of the trusted website.

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload into the `firstname` parameter of the `/admin/admin_user.php` file.
- The vulnerable application processes the request and embeds the unsanitized payload into the response.
- When a user views the page, the malicious script executes within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable application, including injecting a malicious payload in the `firstname` parameter.
- The attacker needs to target an application that uses the vulnerable code of Church Management System version 1.0
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a page with the XSS payload or interact with the malicious payload to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided payload is `firstname=zbdrariI<ScRiPt%20>alert(9125)</ScRiPt>`. This payload demonstrates a basic XSS attack using an alert box.
- The vulnerability is present in Church Management System version 1.0.
- The vulnerability was submitted to VulDB on 04/08/2024.
