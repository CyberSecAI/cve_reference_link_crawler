  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check within the `wcoa_add_attachment` AJAX action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Authorization",
      "Unrestricted File Upload"
    ],

  },
  "fixes": [
    "Added - Check whether the attachment's extension is within the range returned by the get_allowed_mime_types() function.",
    "Added - Check whether the user has the permission to edit the order to which the attachment is being added, using the current_user_can() function and the 'edit_post' capability.",
    "Added - Verification of the attachment request to ensure it does not originate from outside the website using the check_ajax_referer() function."
