### Description

The Order Attachments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized limited arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the wcoa\_add\_attachment AJAX action in versions 2.0 to 2.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload limited file types.
