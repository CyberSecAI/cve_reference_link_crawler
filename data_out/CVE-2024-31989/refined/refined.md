{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Redis database server used by Argo CD was not password-protected by default, allowing unauthorized access. Additionally, the cache in Redis was neither signed nor validated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of risky cryptographic algorithms (FNV64a hash for cacheEntryHash)",
      "Missing cryptographic algorithm (no signing or encryption of Redis cache)",
      "Lack of access controls on the Redis instance (default lack of password protection)",
      "Insufficient network segmentation allowing access to Redis from other pods in the cluster."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the Redis server can gain read/write access to the data, modify the 'mfst' (manifest) key to execute arbitrary deployments via ArgoCD's high privileges, modify the 'app|resources-tree' key leading to an information leak in the live manifest section.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to the Redis server, specifically port 6379, within the Kubernetes cluster.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to the Redis server, which is possible with a pod inside the same cluster due to insufficient network segmentation or misconfiguration."
    
  },
    "fixes": [
        "Enable Redis authentication by default",
        "Implement additional checks for secure communication."
    ]
