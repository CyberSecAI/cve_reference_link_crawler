Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-34440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Dell EMC SCG Policy Manager software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic key can potentially log in to the system and gain administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic key. The CVSS vector string indicates that no privileges are required (PR:N) and no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same system or have local access to it to exploit the vulnerability.
