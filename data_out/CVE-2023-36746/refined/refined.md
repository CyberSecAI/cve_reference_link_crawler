Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-36746**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability lies in the `fstWritex` function within the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function of GTKWave. Specifically, an integer overflow can occur when handling the `len` parameter in `fstWritex`, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write to the heap. The `len` parameter is derived from the `xc->signal_lens[idx]` which is a `uint32_t` and can be larger than `0x7fffffff`, causing `len` to become negative when passed to `fstWritex` since `len` is an `int`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:**  The conversion of the unsigned 32-bit `xc->signal_lens[idx]` to a signed 32-bit integer `len` in the `fstWritex` function creates the potential for an integer overflow. When `xc->signal_lens[idx]` is greater than `0x7fffffff`, `len` becomes a negative number.
    *   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The negative `len` in memcpy within `fstWritex` can lead to out-of-bounds writes on the heap.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write corrupts the heap memory. This memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because of the multi-threaded nature of GTKWave, an attacker may be able to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Maliciously Crafted .fst File:** The attacker must create a specially crafted `.fst` file. This file must contain a `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS`, or `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2` block with a `xc->signal_lens[idx]` value that causes the integer overflow.
    *   **User Interaction:** A victim must open the malicious `.fst` file using GTKWave (either through the UI or a command-line tool).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific `.fst` file.
    *   The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the file with a vulnerable version of GTKWave.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Talos report indicates that this vulnerability is fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   The provided text also describes another related vulnerability, CVE-2023-36747, in the same function, triggered in a slightly different code path.
*   The `memcpy` implementation determines whether a negative `len` parameter will cause the out-of-bounds write.
