{
  "CVE-2024-0450": {
    "Description": "The zipfile module is vulnerable to “quoted-overlap” zip-bombs which exploit the zip format to create a zip-bomb with a high compression ratio. The fixed versions of CPython makes the zipfile module reject zip archives which overlap entries in the archive.",
    "Root cause": "The zipfile module did not properly handle zip files with overlapping entries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The zipfile module did not perform checks to prevent overlapping entries.",
      "Lack of proper validation on the zip file structure."
    ],
    "Impact": "A specially crafted zip file could cause a denial of service (DoS) attack by consuming excessive storage or resources during extraction. Specifically it could lead to a “quoted-overlap” zip bomb.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "By providing a malicious zip file to be processed by the zipfile module."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to provide or upload a malicious zip file. No specific privileges are required beyond access to the affected application."
