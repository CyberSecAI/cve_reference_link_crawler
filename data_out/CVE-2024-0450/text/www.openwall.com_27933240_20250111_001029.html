Subject: Security fixes in Python 3.10.14, 3.9.19, and 3.8.19 (CVE-2023-6597 &
 CVE-2024-0450)

<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-10-14-3-9-19-and-3-8-19-is-now-available/48993>
announces the availability of Python 3.10.14, 3.9.19, and 3.8.19,
including these security fixes (see above URL for links to details on each):

- gh-115399 & gh-115398: bundled libexpat was updated to 2.6.0 to address
   CVE-2023-52425, and control of the new reparse deferral functionality was
   exposed with new APIs. Thanks to Sebastian Pipping, the maintainer of
   libexpat, who worked with us directly on incorporating those fixes!

- gh-109858 : zipfile is now protected from the “quoted-overlap” zipbomb to
   address CVE-2024-0450 . It now raises BadZipFile when attempting to read an
   entry that overlaps with another entry or central directory

- gh-91133: tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer dereferences symlinks
   when working around file system permission errors to address CVE-2023-6597

- gh-115197: urllib.request no longer resolves the hostname before checking it
   against the system’s proxy bypass list on macOS and Windows

- gh-81194: a crash in socket.if_indextoname() with a specific value (UINT_MAX)
   was fixed. Relatedly, an integer overflow in socket.if_indextoname() on 64-bit
   non-Windows platforms was fixed

- gh-113659: .pth files with names starting with a dot or containing the hidden
   file attribute are now skipped

- gh-102388: iso2022_jp_3 and iso2022_jp_2004 codecs no longer read out of
   bounds

- gh-114572 : ssl.SSLContext.cert_store_stats() and
   ssl.SSLContext.get_ca_certs() now correctly lock access to the certificate
   store, when the ssl.SSLContext is shared across multiple threads

Presumably releases for 3.11 & 3.12 will follow as the announcements of the
two new CVEs listed them as also affected.

   [CVE-2024-0450] Quoted zip-bomb protection for zipfile

   An issue was found in the CPython `zipfile` module affecting versions
   3.12.2, 3.11.8, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.

   The zipfile module is vulnerable to “quoted-overlap” zip-bombs which exploit
   the zip format to create a zip-bomb with a high compression ratio. The fixed
   versions of CPython makes the zipfile module reject zip archives which overlap
   entries in the archive.

   [CVE-2023-6597] tempfile.TemporaryDirectory dereferences symlinks during cleanup

   An issue was found in the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class
   affecting versions 3.12.2, 3.11.8, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.

   The tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class would dereference symlinks during
   cleanup of permissions-related errors. This means users which can run
   privileged programs are potentially able to modify permissions of files
   referenced by symlinks in some circumstances.
