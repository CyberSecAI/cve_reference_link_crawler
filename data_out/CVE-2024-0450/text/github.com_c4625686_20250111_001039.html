### **[dyingc](/dyingc)** commented [Sep 25, 2023](#issue-1911928055) • edited by bedevere-app bot Loading

| Bug reportBug description: Just found this vulnerability in the latest Python 3.11.5 (and previous 3.10.10).  If we craft a zipbomb using the "quoted-overlap" way (as mentioned [https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https%3A//www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/__;!!ACWV5N9M2RV99hQ!NeHC7dlBypbGhcmQALXGCNyt3gJ-N86F3rJ3GczFSLYbl0kR34I67_YZCxbseU0GGIxRGc4gcPu4Sw$)), this can't be detected by Python's zip file and the zip will be extracted and thus potentially cause a DoS attack by consuming all the storage.  This issue is related to [CVE-2019-9674](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h33x-58qw-vqrp "CVE-2019-9674") but not the same. [CVE-2019-9674](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h33x-58qw-vqrp "CVE-2019-9674") is talking about the "normal" overlap-zipbomb which is a "full" overlap. This can already be detected by Python's new version of zipfile. However, when we craft a "quoted-overlap" zip, as indicated by [https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https%3A//www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/__;!!ACWV5N9M2RV99hQ!NeHC7dlBypbGhcmQALXGCNyt3gJ-N86F3rJ3GczFSLYbl0kR34I67_YZCxbseU0GGIxRGc4gcPu4Sw$), python can't detect and happily starts to extract.  For example, the following is the python to extract a zip file, 116 KB before extraction, goes to as large as 17GB after extraction. The size after extraction can be easily increased to multi TBs or even PBs by adjusting the zip-creation.  ``` import zipfile import sys import os  def extract_zip(zip_path):     """     Extracts the contents of a ZIP file to the current directory.      :param zip_path: Path to the ZIP file     """     if not os.path.exists(zip_path):         print(f"Error: {zip_path} does not exist.")         return      with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:         zip_ref.extractall()         print(f"Extracted contents of {zip_path} to the current directory.")  if __name__ == "__main__":     if len(sys.argv) != 2:         print("Usage: python extract_zip.py <path_to_zip_file>")         sys.exit(1)      zip_file_path = sys.argv[1]     extract_zip(zip_file_path) ``` CPython versions tested on: 3.11 Operating systems tested on: Linux Linked PRs  * [gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb #110016](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/110016) * [[3.12] gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb (GH-110016) #113912](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113912) * [[3.11] gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb (GH-110016) #113913](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113913) * [[3.10] gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb (GH-110016) #113914](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113914) * [[3.9] gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb (GH-110016) #113915](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113915) * [[3.8] gh-109858: Protect zipfile from "quoted-overlap" zipbomb (GH-110016) #113916](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113916) * [Add @requires\_zlib() decorator for gh-109858 tests #113918](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113918) |

| Additional context: This was reported to us on the Python Security Response Team on 2023-09-06. We ultimately concluded it should be handled in public. The form of zip file attack is not "new" (as evidence by that zipbomb link) and several other zip implementations have had to deal with this over the years. Ours still needs to.  I'll summarize more of our discussions there in a followup comment. |

| While we do *at least* have an existing [warning on ZipFile.extractall() in our docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extractall) *"Warning: Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection."* - that text goes on to focus on other reasons. We expect that there are people who don't actually understand the full implications of handling untrusted compressed complex-referential data like zips and just call an API like `.extractall()` without sufficient checks regardless.  [@SethMichaelLarson](https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson) & [@di](https://github.com/di) looked into [PyPI's warehouse](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse) to check how PyPI handles this situation with regards to uploaded packages. It already has a decent seeming zip file checking loop in place that rejects zip files who's extracted size would be huge compared to the input as seen in [pypi/warehouse#13877](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/13877) - that seems to reject the example zipbombs already. [@pradyunsg](https://github.com/pradyunsg) later confirmed that while `pip` itself doesn't do such checks (it probably should) *"we do benefit from PyPI's checks in the default configuration and those benefits transfer to mirrored PyPI indexes as well."* - so in effect we don't currently believe PyPI can host zipbomb wheels - ameliorating this for the community's `pip install` invocations by default. Workarounds & RecommendationsDocument the workaround We should centralize our guidance for Python users on how to avoid the problem when processing untrusted zip files, perhaps with a code snippet such as [the overall extraction size checking loop from Warehouse](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/13877) as an example of the kinds of protection users of `zipfile` today should employ. Having applications and libraries do that is good defense in depth and doesn't require a patched Python runtime.  We also recommend that code handling untrusted zip files always run in a resource constrained container regardless. Fixing Improving our `zipfile` internals to do consistency checks to raise an exception when processing zip files with overlapping sections or inconsistent metadata or whatnot (all of the kinds of things that enable this form of malicious structured file).  How feasible it'll be to backport that is unknown. But as this is only a DoS, for something that *most* code isn't doing (processing untrusted zips), and it can be worked around, I don't think focusing on designing this backporting this all the way back to 3.8 is worth spending extra time on if it requires any.  Reaching out to specific applications that process arbitrary zip files to make sure they're aware of this issue is a good idea. |

| As a workaround, the following check can be used before extracting a ZIP file.  ``` # zipf is an open ZipFile end_offset = zipf.start_dir for zinfo in sorted(zipf.filelist,                     key=lambda zinfo: zinfo.header_offset,                     reverse=True):     if zinfo.header_offset + zinfo.compress_size > end_offset:         raise zipfile.BadZipFile('Overlapped entries')     end_offset = zinfo.header_offset ```  ---   Edited to remove a suggestion of using `reversed` rather than `sorted`. Assume that nefarious zips will intentionally not follow "normal" patterns of having the central directory in the same order, the sorting defends against that. |

| But if the ZIP file was modified in-place after creation, the order can be changed, so it is up to you whether you want to support such corner case.  Applications wanting to do that seem rare & overcomplicated enough that I'd just call that an application design issue corner case that we don't need to spend extra effort to worry about ourselves. |

`[Merge from cpython (](/Dev-Mw/cpython/commit/8870ee53fe0540e7f15eeefb7fb77cbf56097358 "Merge from cpython (#1)

* gh-111926: Set up basic sementics of weakref API for freethreading (gh-113621)

---------

Co-authored-by: Sam Gross <colesbury@gmail.com>

* gh-113603: Compiler no longer tries to maintain the no-empty-block invariant (#113636)

* gh-113258: Write frozen modules to the build tree on Windows (GH-113303)

This ensures the source directory is not modified at build time, and different builds (e.g. different versions or GIL vs no-GIL) do not have conflicts.

* Document the `co_lines` method on code objects (#113682)

Co-authored-by: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>

* gh-52161: Enhance Cmd support for docstrings (#110987)

In `cmd.Cmd.do_help` call `inspect.cleandoc()`,
to clean indentation and remove leading/trailing empty
lines from a dosctring before printing.

* GH-113689: Fix broken handling of invalid executors (GH-113694)

* gh-113696: Docs: Annotate PyObject_CallOneArg and PyObject_CallNoArgs as returning a strong reference (#113697)

* gh-113569: Display calls in Mock.assert_has_calls failure when empty (GH-113573)

* gh-113538: Don't error in stream reader protocol callback when task is cancelled (#113690)

* GH-113225: Speed up `pathlib.Path.glob()` (#113226)

Use `os.DirEntry.path` as the string representation of child paths, unless
the parent path is empty, in which case we use the entry `name`.

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter (#113717)

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter

Mimalloc segments are data structures that contain memory allocations along
with metadata. Each segment is \"owned\" by a thread. When a thread exits,
it abandons its segments to a global pool to be later reclaimed by other
threads. This changes the pool to be per-interpreter instead of process-wide.

This will be important for when we use mimalloc to find GC objects in the
`--disable-gil` builds. We want heaps to only store Python objects from a
single interpreter. Absent this change, the abandoning and reclaiming process
could break this isolation.

* Add missing '&_mi_abandoned_default' to 'tld_empty'

* gh-113320: Reduce the number of dangerous `getattr()` calls when constructing protocol classes (#113401)

- Only attempt to figure out whether protocol members are \"method members\" or not if the class is marked as a runtime protocol. This information is irrelevant for non-runtime protocols; we can safely skip the risky introspection for them.
- Only do the risky getattr() calls in one place (the runtime_checkable class decorator), rather than in three places (_ProtocolMeta.__init__, _ProtocolMeta.__instancecheck__ and _ProtocolMeta.__subclasscheck__). This reduces the number of locations in typing.py where the risky introspection could go wrong.
- For runtime protocols, if determining whether a protocol member is callable or not fails, give a better error message. I think it's reasonable for us to reject runtime protocols that have members which raise strange exceptions when you try to access them. PEP-544 clearly states that all protocol member must be callable for issubclass() calls against the protocol to be valid -- and if a member raises when we try to access it, there's no way for us to figure out whether it's a callable member or not!

* GH-113486: Do not emit spurious PY_UNWIND events for optimized calls to classes. (GH-113680)

* gh-113703: Correctly identify incomplete f-strings in the codeop module (#113709)

* gh-101100: Fix Sphinx warnings for 2.6 deprecations and removals (#113725)

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>
Co-authored-by: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>

* gh-80532: Do not set ipv6type when cross-compiling (#17956)

Co-authored-by: Xavier de Gaye <xdegaye@gmail.com>

* gh-101100: Fix Sphinx warnings in `library/pyclbr.rst` (#113739)

Co-authored-by: Alex Waygood <Alex.Waygood@Gmail.com>

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages (#113742)

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages

Mimalloc pages are data structures that contain contiguous allocations
of the same block size. Note that they are distinct from operating
system pages. Mimalloc pages are contained in segments.

When a thread exits, it abandons any segments and contained pages that
have live allocations. These segments and pages may be later reclaimed
by another thread. To support GC and certain thread-safety guarantees in
free-threaded builds, we want pages to only be reclaimed by the
corresponding heap in the claimant thread. For example, we want pages
containing GC objects to only be claimed by GC heaps.

This allows heaps and pages to be tagged with an integer tag that is
used to ensure that abandoned pages are only claimed by heaps with the
same tag. Heaps can be initialized with a tag (0-15); any page allocated
by that heap copies the corresponding tag.

* Fix conversion warning

* gh-113688: Split up gcmodule.c (gh-113715)

This splits part of Modules/gcmodule.c of into Python/gc.c, which
now contains the core garbage collection implementation. The Python
module remain in the Modules/gcmodule.c file.

* GH-113568: Stop raising auditing events from pathlib ABCs (#113571)

Raise auditing events in `pathlib.Path.glob()`, `rglob()` and `walk()`,
but not in `pathlib._abc.PathBase` methods. Also move generation of a
deprecation warning into `pathlib.Path` so it gets the right stack level.

* gh-85567: Fix resouce warnings in pickle and pickletools CLIs (GH-113618)

Explicitly open and close files instead of using FileType.

* gh-113360: Fix the documentation of module's attribute __test__ (GH-113393)

It can only be a dict since Python 2.4.

* GH-113568: Stop raising deprecation warnings from pathlib ABCs (#113757)

gh-113750: Fix object resurrection on free-threaded builds

This avoids the undesired re-initializing of fields like `ob_gc_bits`,
`ob_mutex`, and `ob_tid` when an object is resurrected due to its
finalizer being called.

This change has no effect on the default (with GIL) build.

* gh-113729: Fix IDLE's Help -> \"IDLE Help\" menu bug in 3.12.1 and 3.11.7 (#113731)

* GH-113528: pathlib ABC tests: add repr to dummy path classes. (#113777)

The `DummyPurePath` and `DummyPath` test classes are simple subclasses of
`PurePathBase` and `PathBase`. This commit adds `__repr__()` methods to the
dummy classes, which makes debugging test failures less painful.

* GH-113528: Split up pathlib tests for invalid basenames. (#113776)

Split test cases for invalid names into dedicated test methods. This will
make it easier to refactor tests for invalid name handling in ABCs later.

No change of coverage, just a change of test suite organisation.

* GH-113528: Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling (#113763)

Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling

rather than all paths below the first `linkD/` segment. This allows us
to test that other paths under `linkD/` are correctly returned.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.name` (#113531)

sake.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parent` (#113530)

`PurePath`.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (#113529)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`PurePathBase.relative_to()`, and move the assignment of `_drv`, `_root`
and `_tail_cached` slots into `PurePath.relative_to()`.

* gh-89532: Remove LibreSSL workarounds (#28728)

Remove LibreSSL specific workaround ifdefs from `_ssl.c` and delete the non-version-specific `_ssl_data.h` file (relevant for OpenSSL < 1.1.1, which we no longer support per PEP 644).

* GH-113528: Move a few misplaced pathlib tests (#113527)

`PurePathBase` does not define `__eq__()`, and so we have no business checking path equality in `test_eq_common` and `test_equivalences`. The tests only pass at the moment because we define the test class's `__eq__()` for use elsewhere.

Also move `test_parse_path_common` into the main pathlib test suite. It exercises a private `_parse_path()` method that will be moved to `PurePath` soon.

Lastly move a couple more tests concerned with optimisations and path normalisation.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parts` (#113883)

Implement `parts` using `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()`
repeatedly. This avoids use of `_tail`, which will be moved to `PurePath`
shortly.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (again) (#113882)

Restore full battle-tested implementations of `PurePath.[is_]relative_to()`. These were recently split up in 3375dfe and a15a773.

In `PurePathBase`, add entirely new implementations based on `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()` repeatedly to disassemble a path. These new implementations preserve features like trailing slashes where possible, while still observing that a `..` segment cannot be added to traverse an empty or `.` segment in *walk_up* mode. They do not rely on `parents` nor `__eq__()`, nor do they spin up temporary path objects.

Unfortunately calling `pathmod.relpath()` isn't an option, as it calls `abspath()` and in turn `os.getcwd()`, which is impure.

* gh-111968: Introduce _PyFreeListState and _PyFreeListState_GET API (gh-113584)

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase` (#113559)

Apply pathlib's normalization and performance tuning in `pathlib.PurePath`, but not `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase`.

With this change, the pathlib ABCs do not normalize away alternate path separators, empty segments, or dot segments. A single string given to the initialiser will round-trip by default, i.e. `str(PurePathBase(my_string)) == my_string`. Implementors can set their own path domain-specific normalization scheme by overriding `__str__()`

Eliminating path normalization makes maintaining and caching the path's parts and string representation both optional and not very useful, so this commit moves the `_drv`, `_root`, `_tail_cached` and `_str` slots from `PurePathBase` to `PurePath`. Only `_raw_paths` and `_resolving` slots remain in `PurePathBase`. This frees the ABCs from the burden of some of pathlib's hardest-to-understand code.

* pathlib ABCs: Require one or more initialiser arguments (#113885)

Refuse to guess what a user means when they initialise a pathlib ABC
without any positional arguments. In mainline pathlib it's normalised to
`.`, but in the ABCs this guess isn't appropriate; for example, the path
type may not represent the current directory as `.`, or may have no concept
of a \"current directory\" at all.

* gh-112182: Replace StopIteration with RuntimeError for future (#113220)

When an `StopIteration` raises into `asyncio.Future`, this will cause

People constructing zipfile.ZipInfo instances to pass into existing APIs to control per-file compression levels already treat this as public, there was never a reason for it not to be.

I used the more modern name compress_level instead of compresslevel as the keyword argument on other ZipFile APIs is called to be consistent with compress_type and a general long term preference of not runningwordstogether without a separator in names.

like `//foo`.

* pathlib ABCs: add `_raw_path` property (#113976)

It's wrong for the `PurePathBase` methods to rely so much on `__str__()`.
Instead, they should treat the raw path(s) as opaque objects and leave the
details to `pathmod`.

This commit adds a `PurePathBase._raw_path` property and uses it through
many of the other ABC methods. These methods are all redefined in
`PurePath` and `Path`, so this has no effect on the public classes.

* Add `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase` (#113893)

Path modules provide a subset of the `os.path` API, specifically those
functions needed to provide `PurePathBase` functionality. Each
`PurePathBase` subclass references its path module via a `pathmod` class
attribute.

This commit adds a new `PathModuleBase` class, which provides abstract
methods that unconditionally raise `UnsupportedOperation`. An instance of
this class is assigned to `PurePathBase.pathmod`, replacing `posixpath`.
As a result, `PurePathBase` is no longer POSIX-y by default, and
all its methods raise `UnsupportedOperation` courtesy of `pathmod`.

Users who subclass `PurePathBase` or `PathBase` should choose the path

own subclass of `PathModuleBase`, as circumstances demand.

* Replace `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase.splitroot()` with `splitdrive()` (#114065)

This allows users of the `pathlib-abc` PyPI package to use `posixpath` or
`ntpath` as a path module in versions of Python lacking
`os.path.splitroot()` (3.11 and before).

`PyComplex_RealAsDouble()`/`PyComplex_ImagAsDouble` now try to convert
an object to a `complex` instance using its `__complex__()` method
before falling back to the ``__float__()`` method.

PyComplex_ImagAsDouble() also will not silently return 0.0 for
non-complex types anymore.  Instead we try to call PyFloat_AsDouble()
and return 0.0 only if this call is successful.

* gh-112532: Fix memory block count for free-threaded build (gh-113995)

This fixes `_PyInterpreterState_GetAllocatedBlocks()` and
`_Py_GetGlobalAllocatedBlocks()` in the free-threaded builds. The
gh-113263 change that introduced multiple mimalloc heaps per-thread
broke the logic for counting the number of allocated blocks. For subtle
reasons, this led to reported reference count leaks in the refleaks
buildbots.

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator (#113747)

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator

The GC implementation for free-threaded builds will need to accurately
detect if the debug allocator is used because it affects the offset of
the Python object from the beginning of the memory allocation. The
current implementation of `_PyMem_DebugEnabled` only considers if the
debug allocator is the outer-most allocator; it doesn't handle the case
of \"hooks\" like tracemalloc being used on top of the debug allocator.

This change enables more accurate detection of the debug allocator by
tracking when debug hooks are enabled.

* Simplify _PyMem_DebugEnabled

* gh-113205: test_multiprocessing.test_terminate: Test the API on threadpools (#114186)

gh-113205: test_multiprocessing.test_terminate: Test the API works on threadpools

Threads can't be forced to terminate (without potentially corrupting too much
state), so the  expected behaviour of `ThreadPool.terminate` is to wait for
the currently executing tasks to finish.

The entire test was skipped in GH-110848 (0e9c364f4ac18a2237bdbac702b96bcf8ef9cb09).
Instead of skipping it entirely, we should ensure the API eventually succeeds:
use a shorter timeout.

For the record: on my machine, when the test is un-skipped, the task manages to
start in about 1.5% cases.

* GH-79634: Accept path-like objects as pathlib glob patterns. (#114017)

Allow `os.PathLike` objects to be passed as patterns to `pathlib.Path.glob()` and `rglob()`. (It's already possible to use them in `PurePath.match()`)

While we're in the area:

- Allow empty glob patterns in `PathBase` (but not `Path`)
- Speed up globbing in `PathBase` by generating paths with trailing slashes only as a final step, rather than for every intermediate directory.
- Simplify and speed up handling of rare patterns involving both `**` and `..` segments.

* GH-113225: Speed up `pathlib.Path.walk(top_down=False)` (#113693)

Use `_make_child_entry()` rather than `_make_child_relpath()` to retrieve
path objects for directories to visit. This saves the allocation of one
path object per directory in user subclasses of `PathBase`, and avoids a
second loop.

This trick does not apply when walking top-down, because users can affect
the walk by modifying *dirnames* in-place.

A side effect of this change is that, in bottom-up mode, subdirectories of
each directory are visited in reverse order, and that this order doesn't
match that of the names in *dirnames*. I suspect this is fine as the
order is arbitrary anyway.

* gh-114332: Fix the flags reference for ``re.compile()`` (#114334)

* gh-111926: Set up basic sementics of weakref API for freethreading (gh-113621)

---------

Co-authored-by: Sam Gross <colesbury@gmail.com>

* gh-113603: Compiler no longer tries to maintain the no-empty-block invariant (#113636)

* gh-113258: Write frozen modules to the build tree on Windows (GH-113303)

This ensures the source directory is not modified at build time, and different builds (e.g. different versions or GIL vs no-GIL) do not have conflicts.

* Document the `co_lines` method on code objects (#113682)

Co-authored-by: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>

* gh-52161: Enhance Cmd support for docstrings (#110987)

In `cmd.Cmd.do_help` call `inspect.cleandoc()`,
to clean indentation and remove leading/trailing empty
lines from a dosctring before printing.

* GH-113689: Fix broken handling of invalid executors (GH-113694)

* gh-113696: Docs: Annotate PyObject_CallOneArg and PyObject_CallNoArgs as returning a strong reference (#113697)

* gh-113569: Display calls in Mock.assert_has_calls failure when empty (GH-113573)

* gh-113538: Don't error in stream reader protocol callback when task is cancelled (#113690)

* GH-113225: Speed up `pathlib.Path.glob()` (#113226)

Use `os.DirEntry.path` as the string representation of child paths, unless
the parent path is empty, in which case we use the entry `name`.

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter (#113717)

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter

Mimalloc segments are data structures that contain memory allocations along
with metadata. Each segment is \"owned\" by a thread. When a thread exits,
it abandons its segments to a global pool to be later reclaimed by other
threads. This changes the pool to be per-interpreter instead of process-wide.

This will be important for when we use mimalloc to find GC objects in the
`--disable-gil` builds. We want heaps to only store Python objects from a
single interpreter. Absent this change, the abandoning and reclaiming process
could break this isolation.

* Add missing '&_mi_abandoned_default' to 'tld_empty'

* gh-113320: Reduce the number of dangerous `getattr()` calls when constructing protocol classes (#113401)

- Only attempt to figure out whether protocol members are \"method members\" or not if the class is marked as a runtime protocol. This information is irrelevant for non-runtime protocols; we can safely skip the risky introspection for them.
- Only do the risky getattr() calls in one place (the runtime_checkable class decorator), rather than in three places (_ProtocolMeta.__init__, _ProtocolMeta.__instancecheck__ and _ProtocolMeta.__subclasscheck__). This reduces the number of locations in typing.py where the risky introspection could go wrong.
- For runtime protocols, if determining whether a protocol member is callable or not fails, give a better error message. I think it's reasonable for us to reject runtime protocols that have members which raise strange exceptions when you try to access them. PEP-544 clearly states that all protocol member must be callable for issubclass() calls against the protocol to be valid -- and if a member raises when we try to access it, there's no way for us to figure out whether it's a callable member or not!

* GH-113486: Do not emit spurious PY_UNWIND events for optimized calls to classes. (GH-113680)

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages (#113742)

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages

Mimalloc pages are data structures that contain contiguous allocations
of the same block size. Note that they are distinct from operating
system pages. Mimalloc pages are contained in segments.

When a thread exits, it abandons any segments and contained pages that
have live allocations. These segments and pages may be later reclaimed
by another thread. To support GC and certain thread-safety guarantees in
free-threaded builds, we want pages to only be reclaimed by the
corresponding heap in the claimant thread. For example, we want pages
containing GC objects to only be claimed by GC heaps.

This allows heaps and pages to be tagged with an integer tag that is
used to ensure that abandoned pages are only claimed by heaps with the
same tag. Heaps can be initialized with a tag (0-15); any page allocated
by that heap copies the corresponding tag.

* Fix conversion warning

* gh-113688: Split up gcmodule.c (gh-113715)

This splits part of Modules/gcmodule.c of into Python/gc.c, which
now contains the core garbage collection implementation. The Python
module remain in the Modules/gcmodule.c file.

* GH-113568: Stop raising auditing events from pathlib ABCs (#113571)

Raise auditing events in `pathlib.Path.glob()`, `rglob()` and `walk()`,
but not in `pathlib._abc.PathBase` methods. Also move generation of a
deprecation warning into `pathlib.Path` so it gets the right stack level.

* gh-85567: Fix resouce warnings in pickle and pickletools CLIs (GH-113618)

Explicitly open and close files instead of using FileType.

* gh-113360: Fix the documentation of module's attribute __test__ (GH-113393)

It can only be a dict since Python 2.4.

* GH-113568: Stop raising deprecation warnings from pathlib ABCs (#113757)

* gh-113750: Fix object resurrection in free-threaded builds (gh-113751)

gh-113750: Fix object resurrection on free-threaded builds

This avoids the undesired re-initializing of fields like `ob_gc_bits`,
`ob_mutex`, and `ob_tid` when an object is resurrected due to its
finalizer being called.

This change has no effect on the default (with GIL) build.

* gh-113729: Fix IDLE's Help -> \"IDLE Help\" menu bug in 3.12.1 and 3.11.7 (#113731)

Co-authored-by: Terry Jan Reedy <tjreedy@udel.edu>

* gh-113537: support loads str in plistlib.loads (#113582)

Add support for loading XML plists from a string value instead of a only bytes value.

* gh-111488: Changed error message in case of no 'in' keyword after 'for' in cmp (#113656)

* gh-107901: synthetic jumps which are not at end of loop no longer check the eval breaker (#113721)

* GH-113528: pathlib ABC tests: add repr to dummy path classes. (#113777)

The `DummyPurePath` and `DummyPath` test classes are simple subclasses of
`PurePathBase` and `PathBase`. This commit adds `__repr__()` methods to the
dummy classes, which makes debugging test failures less painful.

* GH-113528: Split up pathlib tests for invalid basenames. (#113776)

Split test cases for invalid names into dedicated test methods. This will
make it easier to refactor tests for invalid name handling in ABCs later.

No change of coverage, just a change of test suite organisation.

* GH-113528: Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling (#113763)

Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling

When filtering results, ignore paths with more than one `linkD/` segment,
rather than all paths below the first `linkD/` segment. This allows us
to test that other paths under `linkD/` are correctly returned.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.name` (#113531)

Replace usage of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`with_name()`, and take a similar approach in `name` for consistency's
sake.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parent` (#113530)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()`, and move
assignments to `_drv`, `_root`, _tail_cached` and `_str` slots into
`PurePath`.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (#113529)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`PurePathBase.relative_to()`, and move the assignment of `_drv`, `_root`
and `_tail_cached` slots into `PurePath.relative_to()`.

* gh-89532: Remove LibreSSL workarounds (#28728)

Remove LibreSSL specific workaround ifdefs from `_ssl.c` and delete the non-version-specific `_ssl_data.h` file (relevant for OpenSSL < 1.1.1, which we no longer support per PEP 644).

* gh-113755: Fully adapt gcmodule.c to Argument Clinic (#113756)

Adapt the following functions to Argument Clinic:

- gc.set_threshold
- gc.get_referrers
- gc.get_referents

* Minor algebraic simplification for the totient() recipe (gh-113822)

* GH-113528: Move a few misplaced pathlib tests (#113527)

`PurePathBase` does not define `__eq__()`, and so we have no business checking path equality in `test_eq_common` and `test_equivalences`. The tests only pass at the moment because we define the test class's `__eq__()` for use elsewhere.

Also move `test_parse_path_common` into the main pathlib test suite. It exercises a private `_parse_path()` method that will be moved to `PurePath` soon.

Lastly move a couple more tests concerned with optimisations and path normalisation.

* gh-113650: Add workaround option for MSVC ARM64 bug affecting string encoding (GH-113836)

* Fix opcode name printing in debug mode (#113870)

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PathBase._make_child_relpath()` (#113532)

* GH-113661: unittest runner: Don't exit 5 if tests were skipped (#113856)

The intention of exiting 5 was to detect issues where the test suite
wasn't discovered at all. If we skipped tests, it was correctly
discovered.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PathBase.resolve()` (#113782)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`resolve()`.

No effect on `Path.resolve()`, which uses `os.path.realpath()`.

* gh-66060: Use actual class name in _io type's __repr__ (#30824)

Use the object's actual class name in the following _io type's __repr__:
- FileIO
- TextIOWrapper
- _WindowsConsoleIO

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parts` (#113883)

Implement `parts` using `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()`
repeatedly. This avoids use of `_tail`, which will be moved to `PurePath`
shortly.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (again) (#113882)

Restore full battle-tested implementations of `PurePath.[is_]relative_to()`. These were recently split up in 3375dfe and a15a773.

In `PurePathBase`, add entirely new implementations based on `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()` repeatedly to disassemble a path. These new implementations preserve features like trailing slashes where possible, while still observing that a `..` segment cannot be added to traverse an empty or `.` segment in *walk_up* mode. They do not rely on `parents` nor `__eq__()`, nor do they spin up temporary path objects.

Unfortunately calling `pathmod.relpath()` isn't an option, as it calls `abspath()` and in turn `os.getcwd()`, which is impure.

* gh-111968: Introduce _PyFreeListState and _PyFreeListState_GET API (gh-113584)

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase` (#113559)

Apply pathlib's normalization and performance tuning in `pathlib.PurePath`, but not `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase`.

With this change, the pathlib ABCs do not normalize away alternate path separators, empty segments, or dot segments. A single string given to the initialiser will round-trip by default, i.e. `str(PurePathBase(my_string)) == my_string`. Implementors can set their own path domain-specific normalization scheme by overriding `__str__()`

Eliminating path normalization makes maintaining and caching the path's parts and string representation both optional and not very useful, so this commit moves the `_drv`, `_root`, `_tail_cached` and `_str` slots from `PurePathBase` to `PurePath`. Only `_raw_paths` and `_resolving` slots remain in `PurePathBase`. This frees the ABCs from the burden of some of pathlib's hardest-to-understand code.

* pathlib ABCs: Require one or more initialiser arguments (#113885)

Refuse to guess what a user means when they initialise a pathlib ABC
without any positional arguments. In mainline pathlib it's normalised to
`.`, but in the ABCs this guess isn't appropriate; for example, the path
type may not represent the current directory as `.`, or may have no concept
of a \"current directory\" at all.

* gh-112182: Replace StopIteration with RuntimeError for future (#113220)

When an `StopIteration` raises into `asyncio.Future`, this will cause
a thread to hang. This commit address this by not raising an exception
and silently transforming the `StopIteration` with a `RuntimeError`,
which the caller can reconstruct from `fut.exception().__cause__`

* GH-113858: GitHub Actions config: Only save ccache on pushes (GH-113859)

* gh-113877: Fix Tkinter method winfo_pathname() on 64-bit Windows (GH-113900)

winfo_id() converts the result of \"winfo id\" command to integer, but
\"winfo pathname\" command requires an argument to be a hexadecimal number
on Win64.

Use cursive to make it looking like mathematic formulas.

* gh-58032: Do not use argparse.FileType in module CLIs and scripts (GH-113649)

Open and close files manually. It prevents from leaking files,
preliminary creation of output files, and accidental closing of stdin
and stdout.

* gh-89850: Add default C implementations of persistent_id() and persistent_load() (GH-113579)

Previously the C implementation of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
classes did not have such methods and they could only be used if
they were overloaded in subclasses or set as instance attributes.

Fixed calling super().persistent_id() and super().persistent_load() in
subclasses of the C implementation of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
classes. It no longer causes an infinite recursion.

* gh-66515: Fix locking of an MH mailbox without \".mh_sequences\" file (GH-113482)

'see character' call inside click_char, just before the bbox call.

Also, reduce the click_char calls to just one per tag name and
replace the other nested function with a dict comprehension.

Make zipfile.ZipInfo.compress_level public.

A property is used to retain the behavior of the ._compresslevel.

People constructing zipfile.ZipInfo instances to pass into existing APIs to control per-file compression levels already treat this as public, there was never a reason for it not to be.

I used the more modern name compress_level instead of compresslevel as the keyword argument on other ZipFile APIs is called to be consistent with compress_type and a general long term preference of not runningwordstogether without a separator in names.

functions in `os.path`, and with Microsoft's own documentation.

Also adjust `pathlib.PureWindowsPath.is_absolute()` to call
`ntpath.isabs()`, which corrects its handling of partial UNC/device paths
like `//foo`.

* pathlib ABCs: add `_raw_path` property (#113976)

It's wrong for the `PurePathBase` methods to rely so much on `__str__()`.
Instead, they should treat the raw path(s) as opaque objects and leave the
details to `pathmod`.

This commit adds a `PurePathBase._raw_path` property and uses it through
many of the other ABC methods. These methods are all redefined in
`PurePath` and `Path`, so this has no effect on the public classes.

* Add `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase` (#113893)

Path modules provide a subset of the `os.path` API, specifically those
functions needed to provide `PurePathBase` functionality. Each
`PurePathBase` subclass references its path module via a `pathmod` class
attribute.

This commit adds a new `PathModuleBase` class, which provides abstract
methods that unconditionally raise `UnsupportedOperation`. An instance of
this class is assigned to `PurePathBase.pathmod`, replacing `posixpath`.
As a result, `PurePathBase` is no longer POSIX-y by default, and
all its methods raise `UnsupportedOperation` courtesy of `pathmod`.

Users who subclass `PurePathBase` or `PathBase` should choose the path
syntax by setting `pathmod` to `posixpath`, `ntpath`, `os.path`, or their
own subclass of `PathModuleBase`, as circumstances demand.

* Replace `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase.splitroot()` with `splitdrive()` (#114065)

This allows users of the `pathlib-abc` PyPI package to use `posixpath` or

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator (#113747)

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator

The GC implementation for free-threaded builds will need to accurately
detect if the debug allocator is used because it affects the offset of
the Python object from the beginning of the memory allocation. The
current implementation of `_PyMem_DebugEnabled` only considers if the
debug allocator is the outer-most allocator; it doesn't handle the case
of \"hooks\" like tracemalloc being used on top of the debug allocator.

This change enables more accurate detection of the debug allocator by
tracking when debug hooks are enabled.

gh-113205: test_multiprocessing.test_terminate: Test the API works on threadpools

Threads can't be forced to terminate (without potentially corrupting too much
state), so the  expected behaviour of `ThreadPool.terminate` is to wait for
the currently executing tasks to finish.

The entire test was skipped in GH-110848 (0e9c364f4ac18a2237bdbac702b96bcf8ef9cb09).
Instead of skipping it entirely, we should ensure the API eventually succeeds:
use a shorter timeout.

For the record: on my machine, when the test is un-skipped, the task manages to
start in about 1.5% cases.

Allow `os.PathLike` objects to be passed as patterns to `pathlib.Path.glob()` and `rglob()`. (It's already possible to use them in `PurePath.match()`)

While we're in the area:

- Allow empty glob patterns in `PathBase` (but not `Path`)
- Speed up globbing in `PathBase` by generating paths with trailing slashes only as a final step, rather than for every intermediate directory.
- Simplify and speed up handling of rare patterns involving both `**` and `..` segments.

* GH-113225: Speed up `pathlib.Path.walk(top_down=False)` (#113693)

Use `_make_child_entry()` rather than `_make_child_relpath()` to retrieve
path objects for directories to visit. This saves the allocation of one
path object per directory in user subclasses of `PathBase`, and avoids a
second loop.

This trick does not apply when walking top-down, because users can affect
the walk by modifying *dirnames* in-place.

A side effect of this change is that, in bottom-up mode, subdirectories of
each directory are visited in reverse order, and that this order doesn't
match that of the names in *dirnames*. I suspect this is fine as the
order is arbitrary anyway.

* gh-80931: Skip some socket tests while hunting for refleaks on macOS (#114057)

Some socket tests related to sending file descriptors cause a file descriptor leak on macOS, all of them tests that send one or more descriptors than cannot be received on the read end.  This appears to be a platform bug.

This PR skips those tests when doing a refleak test run to avoid hiding other problems.

Use `os.DirEntry.path` as the string representation of child paths, unless
the parent path is empty, in which case we use the entry `name`.

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter (#113717)

* gh-112532: Isolate abandoned segments by interpreter

Mimalloc segments are data structures that contain memory allocations along
with metadata. Each segment is "owned" by a thread. When a thread exits,
it abandons its segments to a global pool to be later reclaimed by other
threads. This changes the pool to be per-interpreter instead of process-wide.

This will be important for when we use mimalloc to find GC objects in the
`--disable-gil` builds. We want heaps to only store Python objects from a
single interpreter. Absent this change, the abandoning and reclaiming process
could break this isolation.

* Add missing '&_mi_abandoned_default' to 'tld_empty'

* gh-113320: Reduce the number of dangerous `getattr()` calls when constructing protocol classes (#113401)

- Only attempt to figure out whether protocol members are "method members" or not if the class is marked as a runtime protocol. This information is irrelevant for non-runtime protocols; we can safely skip the risky introspection for them.
- Only do the risky getattr() calls in one place (the runtime_checkable class decorator), rather than in three places (_ProtocolMeta.__init__, _ProtocolMeta.__instancecheck__ and _ProtocolMeta.__subclasscheck__). This reduces the number of locations in typing.py where the risky introspection could go wrong.
- For runtime protocols, if determining whether a protocol member is callable or not fails, give a better error message. I think it's reasonable for us to reject runtime protocols that have members which raise strange exceptions when you try to access them. PEP-544 clearly states that all protocol member must be callable for issubclass() calls against the protocol to be valid -- and if a member raises when we try to access it, there's no way for us to figure out whether it's a callable member or not!

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages (#113742)

* gh-112532: Tag mimalloc heaps and pages

Mimalloc pages are data structures that contain contiguous allocations
of the same block size. Note that they are distinct from operating
system pages. Mimalloc pages are contained in segments.

When a thread exits, it abandons any segments and contained pages that
have live allocations. These segments and pages may be later reclaimed
by another thread. To support GC and certain thread-safety guarantees in
free-threaded builds, we want pages to only be reclaimed by the
corresponding heap in the claimant thread. For example, we want pages
containing GC objects to only be claimed by GC heaps.

This allows heaps and pages to be tagged with an integer tag that is
used to ensure that abandoned pages are only claimed by heaps with the
same tag. Heaps can be initialized with a tag (0-15); any page allocated
by that heap copies the corresponding tag.

* Fix conversion warning

* gh-113688: Split up gcmodule.c (gh-113715)

This splits part of Modules/gcmodule.c of into Python/gc.c, which
now contains the core garbage collection implementation. The Python
module remain in the Modules/gcmodule.c file.

* GH-113568: Stop raising auditing events from pathlib ABCs (#113571)

Raise auditing events in `pathlib.Path.glob()`, `rglob()` and `walk()`,
but not in `pathlib._abc.PathBase` methods. Also move generation of a
deprecation warning into `pathlib.Path` so it gets the right stack level.

* gh-85567: Fix resouce warnings in pickle and pickletools CLIs (GH-113618)

Explicitly open and close files instead of using FileType.

* gh-113360: Fix the documentation of module's attribute __test__ (GH-113393)

* gh-113750: Fix object resurrection in free-threaded builds (gh-113751)

gh-113750: Fix object resurrection on free-threaded builds

This avoids the undesired re-initializing of fields like `ob_gc_bits`,
`ob_mutex`, and `ob_tid` when an object is resurrected due to its
finalizer being called.

This change has no effect on the default (with GIL) build.

* GH-113528: pathlib ABC tests: add repr to dummy path classes. (#113777)

The `DummyPurePath` and `DummyPath` test classes are simple subclasses of
`PurePathBase` and `PathBase`. This commit adds `__repr__()` methods to the
dummy classes, which makes debugging test failures less painful.

* GH-113528: Split up pathlib tests for invalid basenames. (#113776)

Split test cases for invalid names into dedicated test methods. This will
make it easier to refactor tests for invalid name handling in ABCs later.

No change of coverage, just a change of test suite organisation.

* GH-113528: Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling (#113763)

Slightly improve `pathlib.Path.glob()` tests for symlink loop handling

When filtering results, ignore paths with more than one `linkD/` segment,
rather than all paths below the first `linkD/` segment. This allows us
to test that other paths under `linkD/` are correctly returned.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.name` (#113531)

Replace usage of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`with_name()`, and take a similar approach in `name` for consistency's
sake.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parent` (#113530)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()`, and move
assignments to `_drv`, `_root`, _tail_cached` and `_str` slots into
`PurePath`.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (#113529)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`PurePathBase.relative_to()`, and move the assignment of `_drv`, `_root`
and `_tail_cached` slots into `PurePath.relative_to()`.

* gh-89532: Remove LibreSSL workarounds (#28728)

Remove LibreSSL specific workaround ifdefs from `_ssl.c` and delete the non-version-specific `_ssl_data.h` file (relevant for OpenSSL < 1.1.1, which we no longer support per PEP 644).

Adapt the following functions to Argument Clinic:

- gc.get_referents

* Minor algebraic simplification for the totient() recipe (gh-113822)

* GH-113528: Move a few misplaced pathlib tests (#113527)

`PurePathBase` does not define `__eq__()`, and so we have no business checking path equality in `test_eq_common` and `test_equivalences`. The tests only pass at the moment because we define the test class's `__eq__()` for use elsewhere.

Also move `test_parse_path_common` into the main pathlib test suite. It exercises a private `_parse_path()` method that will be moved to `PurePath` soon.

Lastly move a couple more tests concerned with optimisations and path normalisation.

The intention of exiting 5 was to detect issues where the test suite
wasn't discovered at all. If we skipped tests, it was correctly
discovered.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PathBase.resolve()` (#113782)

Replace use of `_from_parsed_parts()` with `with_segments()` in
`resolve()`.

No effect on `Path.resolve()`, which uses `os.path.realpath()`.

* gh-66060: Use actual class name in _io type's __repr__ (#30824)

- FileIO
- TextIOWrapper
- _WindowsConsoleIO

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.parts` (#113883)

Implement `parts` using `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()`
repeatedly. This avoids use of `_tail`, which will be moved to `PurePath`
shortly.

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase.relative_to()` (again) (#113882)

Restore full battle-tested implementations of `PurePath.[is_]relative_to()`. These were recently split up in 3375dfe and a15a773.

In `PurePathBase`, add entirely new implementations based on `_stack`, which itself calls `pathmod.split()` repeatedly to disassemble a path. These new implementations preserve features like trailing slashes where possible, while still observing that a `..` segment cannot be added to traverse an empty or `.` segment in *walk_up* mode. They do not rely on `parents` nor `__eq__()`, nor do they spin up temporary path objects.

Unfortunately calling `pathmod.relpath()` isn't an option, as it calls `abspath()` and in turn `os.getcwd()`, which is impure.

* gh-111968: Introduce _PyFreeListState and _PyFreeListState_GET API (gh-113584)

* GH-113528: Deoptimise `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase` (#113559)

Apply pathlib's normalization and performance tuning in `pathlib.PurePath`, but not `pathlib._abc.PurePathBase`.

With this change, the pathlib ABCs do not normalize away alternate path separators, empty segments, or dot segments. A single string given to the initialiser will round-trip by default, i.e. `str(PurePathBase(my_string)) == my_string`. Implementors can set their own path domain-specific normalization scheme by overriding `__str__()`

Eliminating path normalization makes maintaining and caching the path's parts and string representation both optional and not very useful, so this commit moves the `_drv`, `_root`, `_tail_cached` and `_str` slots from `PurePathBase` to `PurePath`. Only `_raw_paths` and `_resolving` slots remain in `PurePathBase`. This frees the ABCs from the burden of some of pathlib's hardest-to-understand code.

* pathlib ABCs: Require one or more initialiser arguments (#113885)

Refuse to guess what a user means when they initialise a pathlib ABC
without any positional arguments. In mainline pathlib it's normalised to
`.`, but in the ABCs this guess isn't appropriate; for example, the path
type may not represent the current directory as `.`, or may have no concept
of a "current directory" at all.

* gh-112182: Replace StopIteration with RuntimeError for future (#113220)

When an `StopIteration` raises into `asyncio.Future`, this will cause
a thread to hang. This commit address this by not raising an exception
and silently transforming the `StopIteration` with a `RuntimeError`,
which the caller can reconstruct from `fut.exception().__cause__`

Previously the C implementation of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
classes did not have such methods and they could only be used if
they were overloaded in subclasses or set as instance attributes.

Fixed calling super().persistent_id() and super().persistent_load() in
subclasses of the C implementation of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
classes. It no longer causes an infinite recursion.

Make zipfile.ZipInfo.compress_level public.

A property is used to retain the behavior of the ._compresslevel.

People constructing zipfile.ZipInfo instances to pass into existing APIs to control per-file compression levels already treat this as public, there was never a reason for it not to be.

I used the more modern name compress_level instead of compresslevel as the keyword argument on other ZipFile APIs is called to be consistent with compress_type and a general long term preference of not runningwordstogether without a separator in names.

functions in `os.path`, and with Microsoft's own documentation.

`ntpath.isabs()`, which corrects its handling of partial UNC/device paths
like `//foo`.

* pathlib ABCs: add `_raw_path` property (#113976)

It's wrong for the `PurePathBase` methods to rely so much on `__str__()`.
Instead, they should treat the raw path(s) as opaque objects and leave the
details to `pathmod`.

This commit adds a `PurePathBase._raw_path` property and uses it through
many of the other ABC methods. These methods are all redefined in
`PurePath` and `Path`, so this has no effect on the public classes.

* Add `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase` (#113893)

Path modules provide a subset of the `os.path` API, specifically those
functions needed to provide `PurePathBase` functionality. Each
`PurePathBase` subclass references its path module via a `pathmod` class
attribute.

This commit adds a new `PathModuleBase` class, which provides abstract
methods that unconditionally raise `UnsupportedOperation`. An instance of
this class is assigned to `PurePathBase.pathmod`, replacing `posixpath`.
As a result, `PurePathBase` is no longer POSIX-y by default, and
all its methods raise `UnsupportedOperation` courtesy of `pathmod`.

Users who subclass `PurePathBase` or `PathBase` should choose the path
syntax by setting `pathmod` to `posixpath`, `ntpath`, `os.path`, or their
own subclass of `PathModuleBase`, as circumstances demand.

* Replace `pathlib._abc.PathModuleBase.splitroot()` with `splitdrive()` (#114065)

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator (#113747)

* gh-112529: Track if debug allocator is used as underlying allocator

The GC implementation for free-threaded builds will need to accurately
detect if the debug allocator is used because it affects the offset of
the Python object from the beginning of the memory allocation. The
current implementation of `_PyMem_DebugEnabled` only considers if the
debug allocator is the outer-most allocator; it doesn't handle the case
of "hooks" like tracemalloc being used on top of the debug allocator.

This change enables more accurate detection of the debug allocator by
tracking when debug hooks are enabled.

Threads can't be forced to terminate (without potentially corrupting too much
state), so the  expected behaviour of `ThreadPool.terminate` is to wait for
the currently executing tasks to finish.

The entire test was skipped in GH-110848 (0e9c364f4ac18a2237bdbac702b96bcf8ef9cb09).
Instead of skipping it entirely, we should ensure the API eventually succeeds:
use a shorter timeout.

For the record: on my machine, when the test is un-skipped, the task manages to
start in about 1.5% cases.

* gh-113884: Refactor `queue.SimpleQueue` to use a ring buffer to store items (#114259)

Use a ring buffer instead of a Python list in order to simplify the
process of making queue.SimpleQueue thread-safe in free-threaded
builds. The ring buffer implementation has no places where critical
sections may be released.

* Add a `clean` subcommand to `Tools/wasm/wasi.py` (GH-114274)

* GH-79634: Accept path-like objects as pathlib glob patterns. (#114017)

Allow `os.PathLike` objects to be passed as patterns to `pathlib.Path.glob()` and `rglob()`. (It's already possible to use them in `PurePath.match()`)

While we're in the area:

- Allow empty glob patterns in `PathBase` (but not `Path`)
- Speed up globbing in `PathBase` by generating paths with trailing slashes only as a final step, rather than for every intermediate directory.
- Simplify and speed up handling of rare patterns involving both `**` and `..` segments.

* GH-113225: Speed up `pathlib.Path.walk(top_down=False)` (#113693)

Use `_make_child_entry()` rather than `_make_child_relpath()` to retrieve
path objects for directories to visit. This saves the allocation of one
path object per directory in user subclasses of `PathBase`, and avoids a
second loop.

This trick does not apply when walking top-down, because users can affect
the walk by modifying *dirnames* in-place.

A side effect of this change is that, in bottom-up mode, subdirectories of
each directory are visited in reverse order, and that this order doesn't
match that of the names in *dirnames*. I suspect this is fine as the
order is arbitrary anyway.

* gh-114332: Fix the flags reference for ``re.compile()`` (#114334)

The GH-93000 change set inadvertently caused a sentence in re.compile()
documentation to refer to details that no longer followed. Correct this
with a link to the Flags sub-subsection.

* GH-99380: Update to Sphinx 7 (#99381)

* Docs: structure the ftplib reference (#114317)

Introduce the following headings and subheadings:

- Reference
  * FTP objects
  * FTP_TLS objects
  * Module variables

* gh-112529: Use GC heaps for GC allocations in free-threaded builds (gh-114157)

* gh-112529: Use GC heaps for GC allocations in free-threaded builds

The free-threaded build's garbage collector implementation will need to
find GC objects by traversing mimalloc heaps. This hooks up the
allocation calls with the correct heaps by using a thread-local
"current_obj_heap" variable.

* Refactor out setting heap based on type

* gh-114281: Remove incorrect type hints from `asyncio.staggered` (#114282)

Co-authored-by: Adam Turner <9087854+AA-Turner@users.noreply.github.com>

* Docs: Add missing line continuation to FTP_TLS class docs (#114352)

Regression introduced by b1ad5a5d4.

* Remove the non-test Lib/test/time_hashlib.py. (#114354)

I believe I added this while chasing some performance of hash functions
when I first created hashlib.  It hasn't been used since, is frankly
trivial, and not a test.

* Remove deleted `time_hashlib.py` from `Lib/test/.ruff.toml` (#114355)

* Fix the confusing "User-defined methods" reference in the datamodel (#114276)

* gh-101100: Fix sphinx warnings in `Doc/c-api/memory.rst` (#114373)

* gh-80931: Skip some socket tests while hunting for refleaks on macOS (#114057)

Some socket tests related to sending file descriptors cause a file descriptor leak on macOS, all of them tests that send one or more descriptors than cannot be received on the read end.  This appears to be a platform bug.

This PR skips those tests when doing a refleak test run to avoid hiding other problems.

Their entry for this ([CVE-2024-0450](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jm46-725r-hh9v "CVE-2024-0450")) [GHSA-jm46-725r-hh9v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jm46-725r-hh9v "GHSA-jm46-725r-hh9v") says that 3.12.2 and 3.11.8 are vulnerable, but AFAICS those 2 versions contain the fix (see `gh-109858` mentioned in [3.12.2 release notes](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-2-final) and [3.11.8 release notes](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-11-8-final)).  I've attempted to open an improvement PR [here](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/4204) but I'm not sure if it will be accepted seeing as it says 'Unreviewed' and it seems python is not on the list of things they care about; because the "suggest improvements" button (via which I did it) forced me to select "Affected products" where [c]python was not an option 😢 the nearest thing was 'pip'.  AFAICS this GHSA data feeds through into tools like Grype which currently say "Fixed?"=unknown and have no "Fixed in" so it would be good to know how to correct the record on which python versions are vulnerable/fixed. |

| Thanks for reporting this [@sparrowt](https://github.com/sparrowt), I'll take a look and update the CVE records accordingly. In theory this will trickle down into GitHub Security Advisories as well since they source a lot of their information from that database. |

| Amazing thank you! I'm not sure how the affected versions / patched versions thing is going to work given GHSA seems to only support packages within certain 'ecosystems' but seemingly not the ecosystem runtime (e.g. python) itself: [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/793763/319345110-975b4d98-eb2a-43e4-ae4e-65d87eb915f0.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1NTQ1MzgsIm5iZiI6MTczNjU1NDIzOCwicGF0aCI6Ii83OTM3NjMvMzE5MzQ1MTEwLTk3NWI0ZDk4LWViMmEtNDNlNC1hZTRlLTY1ZDg3ZWI5MTVmMC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQwMDEwMzhaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0yNmYyYTliZDM3NmMwZmUxODI4YTQ1OTQ0MWU2ZmNiNWNhOGFkNzA1MmJmMmJhMDUxMDQwN2JmMDJiMjM3NTlmJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.-a_wtFyPCaHJG3tw4ZdDovcmXnxzbef2IY1MWzLHK2I) |

| I've fixed the metadata for the CVE. I believe the "syncing" process will happen outside of the manual update process but could be wrong? The GHSA team is aware of the whole ecosystem issue for updating GHSA records. |
