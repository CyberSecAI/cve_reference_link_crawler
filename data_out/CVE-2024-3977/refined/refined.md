- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Jitsi Shortcode plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users such as admin can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed when other users access those settings or any page that utilizes them. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of other users or compromise the entire website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin panel and injecting malicious code into the provided inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level or similar high privileges on the WordPress site.
