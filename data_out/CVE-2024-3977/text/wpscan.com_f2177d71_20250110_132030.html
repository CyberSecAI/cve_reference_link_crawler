## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Jitsi Shortcode <= 0.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=jitsi-wordpress-settings
2. Add the payload `"><script>alert(2)</script>"` to either of the inputs.
3. Save and and see the XSS.
