## CVE-2024-2379

# QUIC certificate check bypass with wolfSSL

Project curl Security Advisory, March 27 2024 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2024-2379.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl skips the certificate verification for a QUIC connection
under certain conditions, when built to use wolfSSL. If told to use an
unknown/bad cipher or curve, the error path accidentally skips the
verification and returns OK, thus ignoring any certificate problems.

## INFO

To trigger, this issue also requires that the used wolfSSL library
was built with the `OPENSSL_COMPATIBLE_DEFAULTS` symbol set,
which is **not** set for the recommended
`configure --enable-curl` builds.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2024-2379 to this issue.

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [8.6.0](vuln-8.6.0.html) to and including [8.6.0](vuln-8.6.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [8.6.0](vuln-8.6.0.html) and >= [8.7.0](vuln-8.7.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5d044ad9480a9f556f4b6a2>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

This flaw is also accessible using the curl command line tool.

## SOLUTION

Starting in curl [8.7.0](vuln-8.7.0.html), this mistake is fixed.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/aedbbdf18e689a5eee8dc396>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.7.0](vuln-8.7.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Avoid using HTTP/3 with curl built to use wolfSSL

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 10, 2024. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 19, 2024.

curl [8.7.0](vuln-8.7.0.html) was released on March 27 2024 around 07:00 UTC,
coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

The curl security team is not aware of any active exploits using this
vulnerability.
