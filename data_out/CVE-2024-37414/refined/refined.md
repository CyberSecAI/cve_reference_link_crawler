- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Depicter Slider plugin for WordPress, in versions 3.0.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would then be executed when visitors access the site, potentially leading to a variety of malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts are injected through the vulnerable plugin's input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with editor-level privileges can inject malicious scripts.
