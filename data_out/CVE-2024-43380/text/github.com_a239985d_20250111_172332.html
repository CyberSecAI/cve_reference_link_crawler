# fugit parse and parse\_nat stall on lengthy input

Low

[jmettraux](/jmettraux)
published
GHSA-2m96-52r3-2f3g
Aug 17, 2024

## Package

bundler

fugit
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.11.1

## Description

### Impact

The fugit "natural" parser, that turns "every wednesday at 5pm" into "0 17 \* \* 3", accepted any length of input and went on attempting to parse it, not returning promptly, as expected. The parse call could hold the thread with no end in sight.

Fugit dependents that do not check (user) input length for plausability are impacted.

### Patches

Problem was reported in [#104](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/104) and the fix was released in [fugit 1.11.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/fugit/versions/1.11.1)

### Workarounds

By making sure that `Fugit.parse(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse(s)`, `Fugit.parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`, and `Fugit::Nat.do_parse(s)` are not fed strings too long. 1000 chars feels ok, while 10\_000 chars makes it stall.

In fewer words, making sure those fugit methods are not fed unvetted input strings.
