Root cause of vulnerability: The LINE application for iOS (version 8.8.0) allows authentication bypass through runtime manipulation of the Passcode feature.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure Authentication: The application does not properly protect its authentication mechanism against runtime manipulation.
- Improper Authentication: The passcode authentication can be bypassed by forcing a specific method to return a value that disables passcode verification.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the passcode authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application and user data.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker requires access to a jailbroken iOS device.
- Runtime manipulation is performed using tools like Frida to hook into the passcode authentication mechanism.
- The attacker forces the "- [NLAuthenticationManager passcodeEnabled]" method to return "true", effectively disabling passcode verification.
- A malicious application could also perform this attack on a jailbroken device, evading App Store detection.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Physical or remote access to a jailbroken iOS device with the vulnerable LINE application installed.
- Ability to perform runtime manipulation using tools like Frida.
