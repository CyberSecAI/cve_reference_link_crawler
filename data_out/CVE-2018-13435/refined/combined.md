|  | > [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | > \*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in the LINE jp.naver.line application |
|  | > 8.8.0 for iOS. The Passcode feature allows authentication bypass via |
|  | > runtime manipulation that forces a certain method to disable passcode |
|  | > authentication. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack |
|  | > of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes |
|  | > iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > Exploitation Narrative for bypass local authentication on Passcode |
|  | > |
|  | > 1. During passcode authentication, runtime manipulation through |
|  | > frida-trace was conducted in order to identify passcode class/method |
|  | > name. |
|  | > |
|  | > 2. Once the Passcode authentication class/method was addressed, the |
|  | > frida script was created to hook into "- [NLAuthenticationManager |
|  | > passcodeEnabled]" to force disabling the passcode authentication. |
|  | > |
|  | > POC:https://www.dropbox.com/s/eeeusky36jtthi5/LINE-BypassPIN.mp4?dl=0 |
|  | > |
|  | > Recommendation |
|  | > - Consider code obfuscation or security protection on runtime |
|  | > |

|  | > [VulnerabilityType Other] |
|  | > OWASP Mobile Top 10 2016:M4-Insecure Authentication, CWE-287 - Improper Authentication |

|  | > [Attack Vectors] |
|  | > An attacker who is able to access on jail-broken iOS device, could |
|  | > perform runtime manipulation on Passcode authentication which allow |
|  | > attacker to force the return value to be "true". A malicious |
|  | > application which may evade AppStore detection, could attack the LINE |
|  | > application on jail-broken device by hooking into Passcode |
|  | > verification mechanism in order to bypass authentication process. |
