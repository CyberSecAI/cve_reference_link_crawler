Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3598:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an "incorrect handling of MethodHandles.dropArguments() argument" within the Java Libraries component. This suggests a flaw in how the `dropArguments()` method manages or processes its parameters, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-  The core weakness is in the way `MethodHandles.dropArguments()` processes its input. This indicates a logic error that could be triggered under specific circumstances related to method handle manipulation.
- This could also point to missing or insufficient validation of parameters provided to the method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is the potential for remote code execution, unauthorized reading, or modification of data.
- The nature of the flaw suggests that successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the application's security context.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is via a remote attacker, implying that the vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- The specific trigger for the vulnerability likely resides within the Java code, possibly involving method handle manipulation in untrusted applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be capable of manipulating method handles, potentially through a malicious applet, application or crafted input.
- The attacker would likely need to have a degree of sophistication in exploiting Java internals.
- The attacker does not require authentication and can exploit the vulnerability over a network.

**Additional Notes:**
- Several sources indicate that this vulnerability is addressed in OpenJDK 7u111 and 8u101.
- Some content mentions that "Persistent Parameter Processing" is affected by this vulnerability.
- Several sources mention a related bugzilla entry with the id bsc#989723.

This information is extracted from multiple sources and collated to give a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability than what a simple CVE description would provide.
