Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `password` parameter in the `member_register.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where the application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into SQL queries. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Database Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive Data Leakage: They can access sensitive information stored in the database.
- Data Modification/Deletion: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- System Control: In some cases, complete system control could be achieved.
- Service Interruption: Exploitation could lead to service disruption or denial.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/member_register.php` endpoint.
- Malicious Payload in `password` parameter: The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `password` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint: The attacker needs to know the existence and location of the `/member_register.php` endpoint.
- SQL Injection Knowledge:  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication, meaning an attacker doesn't need to have legitimate user credentials to exploit it.
