### Description

The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the mstore\_update\_firebase\_server\_key function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the firebase server key to push notification when order status changed via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
