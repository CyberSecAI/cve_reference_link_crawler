#### ZCS 8.8.7 released

[ZCS 8.8.7](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.7) was released today. It includes fixes for a Persistent XSS vulnerability, [CVE-2018-6882](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6882) / [bug 108768](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108786) and Mailsploit related issues / [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Note: We recommend that all sites **upgrading** to 8.8.7 manually set **zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress** to **FALSE** which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.

 Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch9 released

[ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 9](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.6.0_Patch9) was released today and includes fixes for two Persistent XSS vulnerabilities, [CVE-2017-8802](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8802) / [bug 107925](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=107925) and [CVE-2017-17703](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17703) / [bug 108265](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108265).

If this patch is not applied, one potential workaround to avoid this issue is to set zimbraPrefUseKeyboardShortcuts to FALSE (for all users/classes-of-service). Note: disabling keyboard shortcuts would have the side effect of disabling all ZCS controlled keyboard shortcuts and this may impact normal user client interaction.

 Feb 9, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZWC affected by Mailsploit

All supported versions of Zimbra Web Client (ZWC) *prior to 8.8.7* are affected by [Mailsploit](https://www.mailsploit.com/). *We recommend that all sites upgrading to 8.8.7 manually set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.*

The workaround which addresses most issues is to set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE (if you are an administrator) for all users/classes-of-service. As an end user you can also control this setting by going to 'Preferences > Display names in place of email addresses when available' and deselecting the checkbox for this option (this is the end user control for the preference attribute mentioned above). This issue is being tracked as [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Update 8.8.7 released:  Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### Ransomware targeting ZCS Servers

[Lawrence Abrams](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/) of [Bleeping Computer](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/) has [reported](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zimbra-ransomware-written-in-python-targets-zimbra-mail-store/) that there is a new [ransomware variant](https://gist.github.com/ratasxy/9416254d966bd701b5a85013969febaf), written in Python, that is targeting ZCS server data under **/opt/zimbra/store/**.

At this point, no details have been provided about how any servers were compromised. Without any details, the best advice we can give is:

* Get (and stay) up to date on OS version and patches.
* Get (and stay) up to date on [ZCS](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) version and patches.
* Ensure servers are properly firewalled (see [Ports](/wiki/Ports "Ports") and only allow access to the minimum number of services that is required to meet your business requirements.
* Review and compare your system configuration against best practices like the [CIS benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/latest/).

#### Workaround: OpenSSL padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)

The [2016-05-03 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding a padding oracle in the AES-NI CBC MAC check affects [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/) of ZCS 8.0-8.6.0 (via MTAs and Proxy).

We anticipate releasing 8.6.1 (and 8.7) with fixes for this issue, however if this issue is impacting your environment, the recommended workaround is covered in [bug 104982](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104982). NOTE: in ZCS 8.7+ we are able to easily patch third party packages included with ZCS via [package repos](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository).

First, test that you are vulnerable with the following tool:

<https://filippo.io/CVE-2016-2107/>

* Edit /opt/zimbra/.bash\_profile
  - add the following to the end of user zimbra's .bash\_profile (requires root privs):

  `# workaround CVE-2016-2107

  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000"`
* Edit sudoers - add the following line to your sudoers (/etc/sudoers or whatever is appropriate for your platform):

  `Defaults env_keep += "OPENSSL_ia32cap"`
* Configure postfix - instructs postfix to honor the desired environment variable:

  `$ zmlocalconfig -e postfix_import_environment='OPENSSL_ia32cap'`

A special thanks to Malte Stretz from our Gold Partner, [Silpion](http://www.silpion.de/), for his persistence and hard work to gather the information covered in this workaround! Also this article would be incomplete without mentioning that the original inspiration for this workaround came from <https://mjanja.ch/2013/11/disabling-aes-ni-on-linux-openssl/>.

#### A note on Logjam

There is a lot of chatter about [Logjam - https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/) today.

At this time, the initial impacts to Collab seem to be minimal and are currently limited to the MTA, specifically possible setting changes, depending upon your environment.

Today we updated the [MTA Ciphers](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86#Ciphers_4) section of our Collab 8.6 security wiki page. In short, for anyone concerned about the Logjam (cipher downgrade) style of MitM attacks, the use of 'export' and 'low' ciphers in Postfix should be avoided. Please note that Postfix, by default (<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers>) allows use of lower ciphers. Changing these to 'medium' can reduce client interoperability and/or may cause some clients to fall back to in the clear communication channels instead of using lower grade encryption.

As usual, there are trade-offs involved, but in the light of FREAK ([https://freakattack.com](https://freakattack.com/)) and Logjam ([https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/)) attacks, it may also be argued that using ciphers lower than 'medium' is now potentially providing an illusion of security. With this in mind, our current recommendation is to avoid both 'export' and 'low' ciphers with the hope that complete deprecation of these ciphers will be coming soon.

Please visit <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86> to keep up with our latest recommendations. Also, for those looking to strengthen their security posture, in Collab 8.7 we have a number of enhancements slated including the ability to strengthen **[DH params](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=98852)**. A sneak preview of security related changes/enhancements in the works is available at <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/87>.

Lastly, for those with openssl 1.0.2 available, you may find this post from OpenSSL useful <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/>

Update for 8.0.x customers: In Collab 8.0.x, Java 1.7 is used. Unfortunately, in Java 1.7, the DH parameters are hard-coded to 768 bits (excluding when using export cipher suites, which use 512 bits, but those should already be disabled). The workaround is to use the (Nginx) Proxy always. The other option is to disable all DHE suites. Which has the side effect of losing forward secrecy for any user agents that do not support ECDHE.

#### What the FREAK attack means to Zimbra

Zimbra is aware of a newly disclosed SSL/TLS vulnerability that provides a potential malicious actor with a method to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack the vulnerability is being referred to as FREAK (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), utilizing [CVE-2015-0204](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0204).

The attack allows a malicious actor to force a downgrade of a secure connection to a vulnerable, export grade encryption (READ: weak encryption). Which, [according to Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/03/freak-flaw-undermines-security-for-apple-and-google-users-researchers-discover/), is downgraded to 512-bit encryption that was the maximum allowed under the export controls in place during the 1990s in the U.S. The Washington Post piece goes on to say it is possible to crack 512-bit encryption, today, in approximately 7 hours with the use of 75 computers, which can be rented from a cloud computing provider for approximately $100.

[Matthew Green](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html), cryptographer and research professor from Johns Hopkins, provided a Cliffs Notes version:

A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a 'man in the middle attacker' to downgrade connections from 'strong' RSA to 'export-grade' RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a shocking number of websites -- including government websites. Patch soon and be careful.

In addition to Matthew Green's post and the Washington Post article, the [freakattack.com](http://freakattack.com/) site has additional information, including a list of the top domains still vulnerable, as well as a built in check of the browser used to surf to the site.

#### Zimbra Specifics

Zimbra ships with the OpenSSL library. At this time, Zimbra has assessed Zimbra Collaboration 8.x, 7.x and found no susceptibility to the FREAK attack in the servers. As there is a client side component to this attack, please verify that you are running the latest browsers/clients to lower the risk to this type of attack.

As part of our security program, Zimbra will continue to monitor all developments related to the FREAK vulnerability and update this post as needed.

#### GNU C Library Vulnerability — aka GHOST

Zimbra is aware of a Linux vulnerability, specifically the GNU C Library.

**Details**

The vulnerability appears to have been found by [Qualys](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability) and disclosed in security advisory [CVE 2015-0235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235). It should be noted that the vulnerability was patched in v 2.17 of the library, but at the time was not categorized as a security issue, leading many to maintain stable versions, i.e. vulnerable versions. This is an operating system vulnerability; at this time, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no known exploits against Zimbra's software related to CVE 2015-0235.

**\*\*Recommendation\*\***

Zimbra recommends that anyone running Linux update their systems as soon as possible. And while Linux doesn't usually require a restart, it is recommended to ensure all underlying software services are patched.

#### POODLE Revisited

We have received a few inquiries about the reported TLS protocol vulnerability via the POODLE attack. SSL/TLS services in ZCS come from OpenSSL and Java. This vulnerability does not affect OpenSSL (ref: [http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users@openssl.org/msg75804.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users%40openssl.org/msg75804.html)) and Java is not known to be affected.

For anyone looking for more information, I recommend you look at <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html> by Adam Langley.

#### Security Advisory: Zimbra Community 8.x Security Vulnerability

Security is top of mind for everyone here at Zimbra, which is why we want to inform you that our team just discovered a security vulnerability in Zimbra Community 8.0 (formerly Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise). The vulnerability is relegated to a very specific scenario in which a user within Zimbra Community 8.0 is able to view a user password via a specific API call.

**Summary:** The Zimbra development team has identified a very specific scenario where a user’s password in Community 8 is stored insecurely.

**Affected Versions:** 8.0.0.37997 (unpatched), 8.0.1.39116

**Vulnerability Scoring:** CVSS: 1.4

**Obtaining a fix:** <http://telligent.com/support/m/support/1354746.aspx>

**Details:** The administrative feature to create users leverages non-public APIs that can force a user’s password to be inadvertently stored insecurely.

**Reporter:** Alex Crome (Zimbra)

**When does this occur?**

1. Creating a user through the control panel using Membership Administration (requires administrative privileges)

2. Could occur if a custom plugin was deployed that copied off the extended attributes on a create user event and in turn re-saved those attributes using the UpdateUser API (this is unlikely, but possible)

If you have any questions or would like assistance with applying the patch, please contact support.

This advisory was originally [published here](http://blog.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2014/06/community-8-x-critical-security-vulnerability.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zimbra+%28Zimbra+%3A%3A+Blog%29).

#### Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)

**20140606: Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)**

On June 5, 2014 the OpenSSL project released a [security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt). [CVE-2014-0224](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0224) can allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to be carried out between a vulnerable client and vulnerable server. It is also important to note that Zimbra does not use DTLS nor do we have SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS enabled.

The impact to Zimbra Collaboration Server is as follows:

* ZCS 6 is not affected
* ZCS 7 is not affected
* ZCS 8 is affected

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable.

If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>). Please upgrade to a newer version first, then run this patch.

Zimbra has produced a patch for OpenSSL vulnerabily for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

The following patch instructions must be done on a per server basis:

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol stop

```

* As root:

```
cd /tmp
wget http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh
chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
./zmopenssl-updater.sh

```

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol start

```

After a successful patch, ZCS 8.0.7 will be running 1.0.1h. To verify this, run the following as zimbra user:

```
openssl version

```

On an 8.0.7 patched system the result should be:

```
zimbra$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1h 5 Jun 2014

```

Earlier versions of ZCS will show other versions of OpenSSL - Zimbra patches the existing OpenSSL version appropriate to each ZCS version.

Continue to the next server and repeat the patch process.

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries. It only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra.

#### Critical Security Advisory and Builds/Patches for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability

**Overview**

Zimbra Collaboration Server 8 is susceptible to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug:

* <http://heartbleed.com>
* <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt>
* <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160>

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link directly to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable. Only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are reported as being vulnerable.

Zimbra has produced an OpenSSL patch for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>), so you would please need to upgrade to a secure version first, then run this patch.

The patch is located here:

* <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>

The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Please note: this vulnerability is being reported as having existed and actively attacked since 2012. As such, the private SSL keys for your platform may already have been compromised. After patching, it is recommended to regenerate your SSL certificates and private keys. This is unfortunate, but the only way to ensure that an attacker cannot decrypt your SSL session data.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue if running OpenSSL 1.0.1. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries - it only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra. For example:

* RHEL6\_64 and UBUNTU12\_64 both use OpenSSL 1.0.1 at the OS level and are affected
* SLES11\_64 and UBUNTU10\_64 use OpenSSL 0.9.8 at the OS level, so are not affected

### Patching

The steps to patch are the following:

(as root)
1) wget <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>
2) chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
3) ./zmopenssl-updater.sh

### Zimbra Collaboration 8.0.7 Builds

Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.0.7 - both the Network Edition and Open-Source Edition - have been rebuilt to include the fix for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability.

If you haven't yet upgraded to 8.0.7, the current versions up on the Download site now disable TLS Heartbeat and protect against the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability:

* Network Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-network.html>
* Open-Source Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-opensource.html>

In short:

* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 prior to Thursday, April 10, then your version DOES NOT include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6020 -> **Vulnerable, you would still need the OpenSSL patch**: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/70921-critical-security-advisory-patch-openssl-heartbleed-vulnerability.html>
* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 Thursday, April 10 or after, then your version DOES include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6021 -> **Not Vulnerable, no patch required**

### OpenSSL Patch Update for ZCS 8.0.3 Only

If you patched for the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability for Zimbra Collaboration Server 8.0.3 prior to Wed April 09, 2014, 11:00 Eastern/08:00 Pacific, you will need to re-patch.

Please note: this is ONLY for ZCS 8.0.3. All other patches were fine, but the 8.0.3 openssl builds were still vulnerable. Repeating, this is only for ZCS 8.0.3.

Here is how you can check your build version:
$ zmcontrol -v
(look for "8.0.3")

Please use the test methods below to confirm.

### Testing

There are a few ways you can confirm if your system is vulnerable:

1. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check your version tarball for the build number 6021. For example:

* [http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7\_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64.20140408123937.tgz](http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7_GA_6021.RHEL6_64.20140408123937.tgz) - the build number here is "6021"

2. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check zmcontrol for the build number:

# su - zimbra
$ zmcontrol -v
Release 8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64\_20140408123937 RHEL6\_64 NETWORK edition.

3. If running any version of Zimbra Collaboration, check if the libssl shared library is built with dlts1\_heartbeat:

**Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
dtls1\_heartbeat
$

**Not Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
$

Please let Zimbra know promptly if any problems or questions.

## Spring4Shell Security Hotfix Alert

An RCE vulnerability was identified in Spring Framework. Zimbra was not directly impacted with this issue. But given the evolving and broad nature of this issue we, have updated the following affected packages.

```
zimbra-patch : 9.0.0.1650532159.p24-2
zimbra-mta-patch : 9.0.0.1650532159.p24-1
zimbra-common-core-jar : 9.0.0.1650522520-1
zimbra-common-core-libs : 9.0.0.1650522826-1

| Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RCE vulnerability in Spring Framework | [CVE-2022-22965](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965) | 9.8 | Low | 9.0.0 P24 |

## Log4j zero-day exploit vulnerability

After intensive review and testing, Zimbra Development determined that the zero-day exploit vulnerability for Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) does not affect the current Supported Zimbra versions (9.0.0 & 8.8.15). Zimbra Collaboration Server currently uses Log4j version 1.2.16. The cause of the vulnerability is found in the lookup expression feature in Log4j versions 2.0 to 2.17.

Following are some more updates on the existing and newly reported vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-4104](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg06936.html): This RedHat vulnerability does not affect the current Supported Zimbra Collaboration Server versions (8.8.15 & 9.0.0). For this vulnerability to affect the server, it needs JMSAppender and the ability to append configuration files. Zimbra does not use the JMSAppender.
* [CVE-2022-23307](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07042.html): Zimbra is vulnerable but is not exploitable. To be exploited the system must be running Chainsaw. It is included but is never running.
* [CVE-2022-23305](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07041.html): Zimbra is not vulnerable to this vulnerability, since it does not run the JDBCAppender.
* [CVE-2022-23302](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07040.html): Zimbra is not vulnerable to this vulnerability, since it does not run the JMSSink.

Even though Zimbra is not affected by the Log4j vulnerabilities, we are in the process of updating Log4j to a version that is not affected. Please watch for more updates in the upcoming release.

## Security Fixes

| Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
