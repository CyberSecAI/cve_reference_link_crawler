| Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RCE vulnerability in Spring Framework | [CVE-2022-22965](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965) | 9.8 | Low | 9.0.0 P24 |

## Log4j zero-day exploit vulnerability

After intensive review and testing, Zimbra Development determined that the zero-day exploit vulnerability for Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) does not affect the current Supported Zimbra versions (9.0.0 & 8.8.15). Zimbra Collaboration Server currently uses Log4j version 1.2.16. The cause of the vulnerability is found in the lookup expression feature in Log4j versions 2.0 to 2.17.

Following are some more updates on the existing and newly reported vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-4104](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg06936.html): This RedHat vulnerability does not affect the current Supported Zimbra Collaboration Server versions (8.8.15 & 9.0.0). For this vulnerability to affect the server, it needs JMSAppender and the ability to append configuration files. Zimbra does not use the JMSAppender.
* [CVE-2022-23307](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07042.html): Zimbra is vulnerable but is not exploitable. To be exploited the system must be running Chainsaw. It is included but is never running.
* [CVE-2022-23305](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07041.html): Zimbra is not vulnerable to this vulnerability, since it does not run the JDBCAppender.
* [CVE-2022-23302](https://www.mail-archive.com/announce%40apache.org/msg07040.html): Zimbra is not vulnerable to this vulnerability, since it does not run the JMSSink.

Even though Zimbra is not affected by the Log4j vulnerabilities, we are in the process of updating Log4j to a version that is not affected. Please watch for more updates in the upcoming release.

yum clean metadata
yum check-update

```

* On mailstore node, install the following packages:

```
yum install zimbra-common-core-jar zimbra-common-core-libs zimbra-mbox-store-libs

```

* Then ask yum to update available packages:

```
yum update

```

* Restart ZCS as `zimbra` user:
