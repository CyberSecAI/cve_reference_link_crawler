jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Open Redirect Vulnerability. Maliciously crafted login links to known Jupyter Servers can cause successful login or an already logged-in session to be redirected to arbitrary sites, which should be restricted to Jupyter Server-served URLs. This issue has been addressed in commit `29036259` which is included in release 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
