- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when an attacker with standard privileges on macOS submits malicious input while requesting administrator privileges from the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The application crashes, potentially leading to denial of service. Additionally, the vulnerability allows for the potential reading or modification of data.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, an attacker with standard user privileges on macOS is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with standard privileges on macOS must interact with the application and submit crafted input to trigger the overflow when requesting administrator privileges.
