Fixed API token authentication bypassed when path contains `/healthz`

```
The APITokenAuthMiddleware allowed bypassing the check if the path included `/healthz`. An attacker only needed to include `/healthz` in the URL, even the querystring, to bypass the API token check, for example `/v1.0/invoke/myapp/method/something?foo=/healthz`.

Additionally, this was not checking the method of the request, so requests to `POST /healthz` would cause a service invocation to happen.

This fixes the issue by making the check a lot more strict. The API token check can be bypassed only if:

- The path is exactly `/v1.0/healthz` or `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` (slashes are trimmed on each side)
- The method is `GET`

|  |  | ## Security: API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Security advisory](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A high-severity vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability impacts all users on Dapr <=1.10.9 and <=1.11.2 who are using API token authentication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The Dapr sidecar allowed all requests containing `/healthz` in the URL (including query string) to bypass API token authentication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | We have changed the API token authentication middleware to allow bypassing the authentication only for healthcheck endpoints more strictly. |
