# API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints

## Package

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.2
< 1.10.9

## Patched versions

1.11.2
1.10.9

## Description

### Summary

A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request.

Users who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.

### Details

When API token authentication is enabled, Dapr requires all calls from applications to include the `dapr-api-token` header, with a value matching what's included in the Dapr's configuration. In order to allow for healthchecks to work, the `/v1.0/healthz` and `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` HTTP APIs are excluded from the API token authentication check, and are always allowed.

Dapr <= 1.10.8 and <= 1.11.1 implemented the allowlisting of the healthcheck endpoints by permitting all requests whose URL contains `/healthz` to bypass the API token authentication check. The match applied anywhere in the URL, including the querystring.

As a consequence, attackers were able to bypass API token authentication by including `/healthz` anywhere in the URL, including as a querystring parameter. This allowed attackers to invoke any Dapr API using HTTP, including perform service invocation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
