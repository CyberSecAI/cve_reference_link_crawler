Fixed API token authentication bypassed when path contains `/healthz`

```
The APITokenAuthMiddleware allowed bypassing the check if the path included `/healthz`. An attacker only needed to include `/healthz` in the URL, even the querystring, to bypass the API token check, for example `/v1.0/invoke/myapp/method/something?foo=/healthz`.

Additionally, this was not checking the method of the request, so requests to `POST /healthz` would cause a service invocation to happen.

This fixes the issue by making the check a lot more strict. The API token check can be bypassed only if:

- The path is exactly `/v1.0/healthz` or `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` (slashes are trimmed on each side)
- The method is `GET`

|  |  | ## Security: API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Problem |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Security advisory](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A high-severity vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability impacts all users on Dapr <=1.10.9 and <=1.11.2 who are using API token authentication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Root cause |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The Dapr sidecar allowed all requests containing `/healthz` in the URL (including query string) to bypass API token authentication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Solution |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | We have changed the API token authentication middleware to allow bypassing the authentication only for healthcheck endpoints more strictly. |

# Enable API token authentication in Dapr

Require every incoming API request for Dapr to include an authentication token before allowing that request to pass through

By default, Dapr relies on the network boundary to limit access to its public API. If you plan on exposing the Dapr API outside of that boundary, or if your deployment demands an additional level of security, consider enabling the token authentication for Dapr APIs. This will cause Dapr to require every incoming gRPC and HTTP request for its APIs for to include authentication token, before allowing that request to pass through.

## Create a token

Dapr uses shared tokens for API authentication. You are free to define the API token to use.

Although Dapr does not impose any format for the shared token, a good idea is to generate a random byte sequence and encode it to Base64. For example, this command generates a random 32-byte key and encodes that as Base64:

```
openssl rand 16 | base64

```
## Configure API token authentication in Dapr

The token authentication configuration is slightly different for either Kubernetes or self-hosted Dapr deployments:

### Self-hosted

In self-hosting scenario, Dapr looks for the presence of `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable. If that environment variable is set when the `daprd`â¯process launches, Dapr enforces authentication on its public APIs:

```
export DAPR_API_TOKEN=<token>

```

To rotate the configured token, update the `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the new value and restart the `daprd`â¯process.

### Kubernetes

In a Kubernetes deployment, Dapr leverages Kubernetes secrets store to hold the shared token. To configure Dapr APIs authentication, start by creating a new secret:

```
kubectl create secret generic dapr-api-token --from-literal=token=<token>

```
> Note, the above secret needs to be created in each namespace in which you want to enable Dapr token authentication.

To indicate to Dapr to use that secret to secure its public APIs, add an annotation to your Deployment template spec:

```
annotations:
  dapr.io/enabled: "true"
  dapr.io/api-token-secret: "dapr-api-token" # name of the Kubernetes secret

```

When deployed, Dapr sidecar injector will automatically create a secret reference and inject the actual value into `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Rotate a token

### Self-hosted

To rotate the configured token in self-hosted, update the `DAPR_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the new value and restart the `daprd`â¯process.

### Kubernetes

To rotate the configured token in Kubernetes, update the previously-created secret with the new token in each namespace. You can do that using `kubectl patch` command, but a simpler way to update these in each namespace is by using a manifest:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dapr-api-token
type: Opaque
data:
  token: <your-new-token>

```

And then apply it to each namespace:

```
kubectl apply --file token-secret.yaml --namespace <namespace-name>

```

To tell Dapr to start using the new token, trigger a rolling upgrade to each one of your deployments:

```
kubectl rollout restart deployment/<deployment-name> --namespace <namespace-name>

```
> Assuming your service is configured with more than one replica, the key rotation process does not result in any downtime.

## Adding API token to client API invocations

Once token authentication is configured in Dapr, all clients invoking Dapr API need to append the `dapr-api-token` token to every request.

> **Note:** The Dapr SDKs read the [DAPR\_API\_TOKEN](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/environment/) environment variable and set it for you by default.

![](/images/tokens-auth.png)
### HTTP

In case of HTTP, Dapr requires the API token in the `dapr-api-token` header. For example:

```
GET http://<daprAddress>/v1.0/metadata
dapr-api-token: <token>

```

Using curl, you can pass the header using the `--header` (or `-H`) option. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/metadata \
  --header "dapr-api-token: my-token"

```
### gRPC

When using gRPC protocol, Dapr will inspect the incoming calls for the API token on the gRPC metadata:

```
dapr-api-token[0].

```
## Accessing the token from the app

### Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, it’s recommended to mount the secret to your pod as an environment variable, as shown in the example below, where a Kubernetes secret with the name `dapr-api-token` is used to hold the token.

```
containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myregistry/myapp
    envFrom:
    - secretRef:
      name: dapr-api-token

```
### Self-hosted

In self-hosted mode, you can set the token as an environment variable for your app:

```
export DAPR_API_TOKEN=<my-dapr-token>

```

# API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints

## Package

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.11.2
< 1.10.9

## Patched versions

1.11.2
1.10.9

## Description

### Summary

A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request.

Users who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.

### Details

When API token authentication is enabled, Dapr requires all calls from applications to include the `dapr-api-token` header, with a value matching what's included in the Dapr's configuration. In order to allow for healthchecks to work, the `/v1.0/healthz` and `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` HTTP APIs are excluded from the API token authentication check, and are always allowed.

Dapr <= 1.10.8 and <= 1.11.1 implemented the allowlisting of the healthcheck endpoints by permitting all requests whose URL contains `/healthz` to bypass the API token authentication check. The match applied anywhere in the URL, including the querystring.

As a consequence, attackers were able to bypass API token authentication by including `/healthz` anywhere in the URL, including as a querystring parameter. This allowed attackers to invoke any Dapr API using HTTP, including perform service invocation.
