- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of CO files within Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate a user-supplied value before using it as a pointer, resulting in an untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Untrusted pointer dereference due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to either visit a malicious webpage or open a specially crafted malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CO file or a link to a malicious webpage to the victim. The victim needs to interact with the file or the webpage to trigger the vulnerability.
