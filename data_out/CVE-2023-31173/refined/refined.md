Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the **use of hard-coded credentials** within the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories SEL-5037 SEL Grid Configurator software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The software includes embedded, unchanging credentials, which are used for authentication. This is a significant security flaw as these credentials can be discovered and misused.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The presence of hard-coded credentials allows attackers to bypass the normal authentication mechanisms of the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the normal authentication procedures and gain unauthorized access to the SEL Grid Configurator. This can lead to various malicious actions on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the exploitation of hard-coded credentials that exist within the SEL-5037 SEL Grid Configurator software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be aware of the hard-coded credentials.
*   The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable SEL-5037 SEL Grid Configurator software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the SEL-5037 SEL Grid Configurator software, specifically versions prior to 4.5.0.20.
*   The provided information includes a reference to the instruction manual appendix A and E dated 20230615, indicating that more details are available in those documents.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gabriele Quagliarella of Nozomi Networks.
