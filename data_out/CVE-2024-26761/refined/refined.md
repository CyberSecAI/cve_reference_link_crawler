Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-26761.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Linux CXL subsystem assumes that Host Physical Address (HPA) is equal to System Physical Address (SPA). During HDM decoder setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers are checked to see if the memory is enabled and the CXL range is within a HPA window described in the CFMWS structure of the CXL host bridge. If HPA is not equal to SPA, the CXL range will not match a CFMWS window. This would lead to disabling the CXL memory range, causing the HDM decoder to stop and resulting in a system hang during HDM decoder initialization, particularly on a CXL-enabled kernel boot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect assumption that HPA == SPA within the CXL subsystem.
- Premature disabling of the HDM decoder if the CXL range does not match a CFMWS window when HPA != SPA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System hang during HDM decoder initialization
- Disabling of system memory
- The vulnerability leads to denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs during the HDM decoder initialization process, when the system boots with a CXL-enabled kernel and when HPA is not equal to SPA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be in a special position. The vulnerability is triggered when the system boots using a CXL device with a configuration where HPA != SPA and the kernel is CXL enabled.
