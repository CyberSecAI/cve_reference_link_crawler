Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2022-48675.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A nested deadlock can occur in the InfiniBand (IB) core subsystem during an On-Demand Paging (ODP) flow. The issue arises because `mmput()` is called while holding the `umem_odp->umem_mutex`, which can trigger `exit_mmap()` which leads to `mlx5_ib_invalidate_range()` and attempts to lock the same mutex, resulting in a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Nested locking leading to a deadlock.
- Inadequate handling of mutex locking in the ODP flow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System deadlock.
- The system will become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an ODP flow that leads to a page fault, which then calls `ib_umem_odp_map_dma_and_lock()`.
- This ultimately calls `mmput()` while the mutex is held, leading to the deadlock.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger an ODP flow to cause a page fault in the mlx5_ib driver.
- The attacker should have the ability to allocate memory and manipulate the memory management of the system.

**Additional Notes:**
The fix replaces `mmput()` with `mmput_async()`, ensuring the `exit_mmap()` flow is executed in a different task context and preventing the deadlock.
The provided call trace clearly shows the sequence of function calls leading to the deadlock, including the locking and unlocking of the mutexes.
