### Latest Enhancements to OpenManage Enterprise

New Features in OpenManage Enterprise 4.3

* Support for the latest Dell PowerEdge 17th generation of servers based on iDRAC10
  + OME 4.3 supports discovery, onboarding, health, alerts, firmware updates, remote commands and license management with iDRAC10
  + OME 4.3 does not support the full lifecycle management (e.g. configuration compliance) with iDRAC10. This will be available in the next release of OME.
* OME Advanced and Advanced Plus licenses for iDRAC10 are now available for purchase and shipment both at Point-of-Sale and After Point-of-Sale.
  + OME 4.3 does not support the licenses features of OME at this point. This will be available in the next release of OME.
  + However, we strongly recommend that customer purchase Point-of-Sale licenses directly from factory for ease-of-deployment. This will allow customers to start using the full lifecycle management as soon as they upgrade to the next release of OME without needing to spend time deploying APOS licenses.
  + New OME license SKUs for iDRAC10
    - 634-CSGW, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced, Point of Sale (POS) i.e. comes pre-deployed on servers directly from factory
    - 634-CSGT, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced, After Point of Sale (APOS) – Needs to be deployed by customer using OME license management feature
    - 634-CSGX, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced Plus, Point of Sale (POS) i.e. comes pre-deployed on servers directly from factory
    - 634-CSGV, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced Plus, After Point of Sale (APOS) – Needs to be deployed by customer using OME license management feature
    - 634-CSGS, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced Plus Upgrade, After Point of Sale (APOS) – Needs to be deployed by customer using OME license management feature
  + There is no change to OME license SKUs for iDRAC8 and iDRAC9.
* Custom Roles for OME users
  + Customers can now create multiple custom roles (in addition to the pre-built Admin, Device Manager and View Only roles). They can then assign new or existing users to one of the custom roles.
  + As an example, some customers want to have different users assigned for Firmware Updates and Configuration Compliance. This can now be accomplished with OME 4.3.
* Streamlined support for PLDM Firmware Updates
  + The Platform Level Data Model (PLDM) for firmware updates is a standard developed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) to facilitate the management and updating of firmware across various devices. It also tries to reduce the reboot of servers. However, the need for reboot of server is only determined by iDRAC after the update has been applied to the component. OME 4.3 manages such firmware updates in a graceful way.
* Support for new platforms 17G, XC, XE, VxRail platforms, and VSAN Ready Nodes (Please refer to OME 4.3 Support Matrix for details available on December 13th, 2024: [https://www.dell.com/support/home/product-support/product/dell-openmanage-enterprise/docs](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/dell-openmanage-enterprise/docs) )

### Licensing for OpenManage Enterprise

Installing and using OpenManage Enterprise does not require the OpenManage Enterprise Advanced or OpenManage Enterprise Advanced+ license. The OpenManage Enterprise Advanced or Advanced+ license is needed for key automation features. These include bare metal server deployment and cloning, deploying automatically with Service Tags or Node IDs, Power Manager plug-in. Also advanced configuration features, for example, enforcing configuration compliance, IOA provisioning, and VLAN management, profile management. In addition, the OpenManage Advanced+ license enables plugins for partner integrations (for example Plugin for VMware vCenter). (Note the OpenManage Advanced+ license contains all the features of the OpenManage Advanced license.) Use of advanced features requires that the OpenManage Enterprise Advanced license be installed on the target server. The OpenManage Enterprise Advanced license is a perpetual license that is valid for the life of a server. The license can be bound to the Service Tag of only one server at a time. To view the list of devices and their licenses, select OpenManage Enterprise > Monitor > Reports > License Report, and then click Run.

**OpenManage Enterprise Advanced or Advanced+ licensed based features.**

* **Automated deployment**: Deploy PowerEdge servers automatically with service tags or node IDs.
* **Configuration and drift detection**: Create firmware and configuration baselines for compliance monitoring and enable automated scheduled updates.
* **Enhanced modular management**: Capture and edit chassis templates using the intuitive OpenManage Enterprise user interface.
* **Activate available licensed features of plugins**, such as [Dell OpenManage Enterprise Power Manager](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000176254/support-for-dell-emc-openmanage-enterprise-power-manager). The Power Manager plug-in can be installed and enables streamlined power management through the OpenManage Enterprise console.

The [OpenManage Portfolio Software Licensing Guide](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/unified-workspace/briefs-summaries/openmanage-licensing-guide.pdf) provides additional information for licensing options for your organization.

**Evaluate, Purchase, and Download of the OpenManage Enterprise Advanced license.**

* **Evaluation license**: A 90-day evaluation OpenManage Enterprise Advanced trial license is available which includes [Dell OpenManage Enterprise Power Manager](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000176254/support-for-dell-emc-openmanage-enterprise-power-manager) to fully test and experience all the features. This trial license is limited to work with iDRAC9 Express, Enterprise, and DataCenter licenses only.

* **Download license**: A purchased OpenManage Enterprise Advanced License can be downloaded from [Dell Digital Locker](https://www.dell.com/support/software). License keys are stored online and can be downloaded if needed. If an existing license key-in not available in the Dell Digital Locker or there is an issue with a license key, contact Dell Technologies Technical Support or Customer Care.

**Managing OpenManage Enterprise Licenses**

OpenManage Enterprise Advanced or Advanced+ and iDRAC enterprise or data center licenses can be managed on either an individual server or one to many basis. Individual licenses can be imported onto an iDRAC. For one to many OpenManage Enterprise 4.1 or higher has integrated license management with integration to Dell Digital Locker and license deployment.  [Dell License Manager](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178010/dell-emc-license-manager-dlm)  is a stand alone tool where OpenManage Enterprise is not available.

* **Individual server**
   Utilize iDRAC to manage OpenManage Enterprise Advanced or Advanced+ Licenses for an individual server. [iDRAC web interface, License tab can be used to import, export licenses](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000145345/poweredge-how-to-manage-an-idrac-license-via-the-web-interface) or the RACADM CLI License command can be used to manage licenses as described in the RACADM CLI Guide.
* **Group of servers**
   In addition to the licensing management built into OpenManage Enterprise Dell offers Dell License Manager. [Dell License Manager](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178010/dell-emc-license-manager-dlm) is a stand alone one-to-many license deployment and reporting tool for OpenManage Enterprise Advanced, OpenManage Enterprise Advanced+, iDRAC, and CMC licenses. By using License Manager, a user can download, bind, deploy, inventory and back up OpenManage Enterprise Advanced Licenses as well as iDRAC, CMC, and storage sled licenses. This tool can also inventory licensable systems to report the licensing status and features of the enabled management controller.
