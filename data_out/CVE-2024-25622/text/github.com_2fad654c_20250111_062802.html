### **[utrenkner](/utrenkner)** commented [Jan 2, 2024](#issue-2062956207)

| I believe I have found a bug in how H2O handles headers, which are configured in h2o.conf: Adding or setting a header at host or path level under one host, removes all headers set at global level for other hosts.  I stumbled on this problem on one of our production servers. This is the simplest h2o.conf to explain the problem:  ``` header.set: "x-frame-options: deny"  hosts:   www.example1.test:     listen:       host: 127.0.0.1       port: 80     paths:       "/":         file.dir: "/usr/local/www/data/www.example1.test"   www.example2.test:     listen:       host: 127.0.0.1       port: 80     paths:       "/":         file.dir: "/usr/local/www/data/www.example2.test"  ```  Using this h2o.conf, both hosts deliver files with the header `x-frame-options: deny`. Now, if I add or set any other header to one of the hosts, e.g. `header.set: "Content-Type: text/html"`, then the the other host loses the `x-frame-options: deny` (and any other) header set at global level.  If I use this h2o.conf  ``` header.set: "x-frame-options: deny"  hosts:   www.example1.test:     listen:       host: 127.0.0.1       port: 80     paths:       "/":         file.dir: "/usr/local/www/data/www.example1.test"   www.example2.test:     listen:       host: 127.0.0.1       port: 80     header.set: "Content-Type: text/html"     paths:       "/":         file.dir: "/usr/local/www/data/www.example2.test"  ```  files at [www.example2.test](http://www.example2.test) are delivered with `x-frame-options: deny` and `content-type: text/html`. But files at [www.example1.test](http://www.example1.test) are delivered without `x-frame-options: deny`.  I tried various headers at global, host and path level. I tried adding or setting additional headers at host [www.example1.test](http://www.example1.test) and [www.example2.test](http://www.example2.test): I always encountered this problem.  Note, I used the official FreeBSD port by [@dch](https://github.com/dch) which uses a snapshot of 7 November 2023 (at [b15937e](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/b15937e082e5ec70bcee3fd699897fd670b3e0e0)). |

| Just noticed: Any of the header-configurations at path level also eliminates headers set at host level. E.g. I set a certain header at host level, but for one specific path, I need to unset it. However, this leads all headers set at host level to disappear in all other paths of that host. |
