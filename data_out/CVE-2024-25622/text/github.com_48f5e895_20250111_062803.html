# headers configuration directive ignored

Low

published

Oct 11, 2024

## Package

h2o

## Affected versions

commits up to 5f5cd8e

## Patched versions

commit 123f5e2 and above

## Description

### Impact

The configuration directives provided by the [headers handler](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/headers_directives.html) allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has [scopes](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/syntax_and_structure.html), and the inner scopes (e.g., path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level).

However, if a header directive is used in the inner scope, all the definition in outer scopes are ignored.

This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior.

To give an example, the following file adds a `X-XSS-Protection` at global level, with the intent to send it always. Then, it add a `foo` header field for `example.com/`, hoping that both `X-XSS-Protection` and `foo` will be sent. But due the bug, only `foo` will be sent, leading to missing mitigation against header-based XSS inside the web browsers.

```
header.set: "X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block"
hosts:
  example.com:
    paths:
      "/":
        header.set: "foo: bar"
        ...
```
### Patches

The bug was fixed by commit [123f5e2](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be).

### Workarounds

When using a headers directive at the inner scope, repeat all the settings defined at the outer scope.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
