- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A division-by-zero error occurs in the `ReadEnhMetaFile()` function within `coders/emf.c`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code is vulnerable to a division-by-zero error. The value `pBits`, which is used as the divisor, is controllable by an attacker, which could cause a zero value and trigger a division-by-zero exception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The division-by-zero error can cause the program to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted EMF file where the `pBits` variable would be zero.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to provide an crafted EMF file to the application.
