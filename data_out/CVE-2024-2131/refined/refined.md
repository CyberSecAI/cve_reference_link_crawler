Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2131

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "infobox" and "button" widgets of the Move Addons for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts are executed whenever a user accesses the page, potentially leading to:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Malicious redirects
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's infobox and button widgets.
- An attacker injects malicious code into attributes of these widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or higher:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least contributor-level permissions within the WordPress site. This is because only users with those privileges can access the relevant settings/functionalities in order to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Move Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including version 1.2.9.
- The issue is resolved in version 1.3.0.
- CVE-2024-29920 may be a duplicate of this issue.
