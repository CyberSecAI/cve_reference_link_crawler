### [Google Sheet Viewer](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/google-sheet-viewer/)

There have been lots of commercial imitations, but this is still be best and most dependable Google sheet viewer available …. even without support!
Hopefully, Meitar, will imagine some improvements and update it someday!
By far, this is one of the BEST plugins for Wordpress!

This plugin loads FIFTEEEN external files (js/css) on EVERY PAGE OF YOUR SITE, in addition to it’s own js files. This is totally unnecessary and a fundamental flaw in the design. It should only load these files on the pages that require it.

Even as a neophyte Google Sheets user I found this plugin straightforward and easy to use. Wonderful for sharing data to Wordpress.

I have been using it for about 9 months. I do not understand those who write negative comments here. Solution suggestions for many problems are presented here. all I tried works well.
Thank you very much for your efforts.
