Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'gdoc' shortcode of the Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer plugin. Specifically, the `chart_resolution` attribute is mentioned as an injection point.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `gdoc` shortcode provided by the plugin, where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `chart_resolution` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This is because users with contributor roles and higher can create or modify content where shortcodes can be used.
