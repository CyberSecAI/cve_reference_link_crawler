### Description

The Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'gdoc' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.13.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'chart\_resolution'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

There have been lots of commercial imitations, but this is still be best and most dependable Google sheet viewer available …. even without support!
Hopefully, Meitar, will imagine some improvements and update it someday!
By far, this is one of the BEST plugins for Wordpress!

This plugin loads FIFTEEEN external files (js/css) on EVERY PAGE OF YOUR SITE, in addition to it’s own js files. This is totally unnecessary and a fundamental flaw in the design. It should only load these files on the pages that require it.

Even as a neophyte Google Sheets user I found this plugin straightforward and easy to use. Wonderful for sharing data to Wordpress.

Thank you very much for your efforts.
