- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Aspera Faspex 5.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session in the application's web interface. This could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the application.
    - Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user who can interact with the vulnerable component of the application to inject malicious code, and this injection is stored persistently.
