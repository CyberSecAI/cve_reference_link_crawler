- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can modify system values, which could then be used to inject malicious code into webpages served by the device, potentially leading to compromise of a user's browser viewing the modified webpage.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a webpage on the device that has been modified by an attacker with admin privileges. The attacker modifies system values which affects the content of the webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative privileges to modify system values on the affected device. They must also modify system values so that the resulting content of the webpage is malicious.
