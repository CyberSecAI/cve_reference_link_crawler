### Acknowledgements:

The following issues were found by external researchers. Intel would like to thank Yngweijw (Jiawei Yin) (CVE-2022-27879, CVE-2022-38083) and Jeremy Boone (@uffeux) (CVE-2022-44611) for reporting these issues.

CVE-2022-43505 was found separately by external researchers and Intel employees. Intel would like to thank Sergiu Ghetie, the CEO of Cloud Tank Inc., for the discovery of the original security vulnerability, disclosure and proposed mitigation. Intel would like to thank Benoit Morgan, Alyssa Milburn, Ke Sun, and Yuval Herman.

CVE-2022-37343 was found internally by Intel employees. Intel would like to thank Nicholas Lee Morgan (CVE-2022-37343).

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
