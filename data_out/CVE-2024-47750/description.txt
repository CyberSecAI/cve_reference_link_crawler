In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix Use-After-Free of rsv_qp on HIP08

Currently rsv_qp is freed before ib_unregister_device() is called
on HIP08. During the time interval, users can still dereg MR and
rsv_qp will be used in this process, leading to a UAF. Move the
release of rsv_qp after calling ib_unregister_device() to fix it.
