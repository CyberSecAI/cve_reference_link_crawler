GPUs from all six of the major suppliers are vulnerable to a newly discovered attack that allows malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites, researchers have demonstrated in a paper published Tuesday.

The cross-origin attack allows a malicious website from one domain—say, example.com—to effectively read the pixels displayed by a website from example.org, or another different domain. Attackers can then reconstruct them in a way that allows them to view the words or images displayed by the latter site. This leakage violates a critical security principle that forms one of the most fundamental security boundaries safeguarding the Internet. Known as the [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), it mandates that content hosted on one website domain be isolated from all other website domains.

## Optimizing bandwidth at a cost

GPU.zip, as the proof-of-concept attack has been named, starts with a malicious website that places a link to the webpage it wants to read inside of an [iframe](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-iframe/), a common HTML element that allows sites to embed ads, images, or other content hosted on other websites. Normally, the same origin policy prevents either site from inspecting the source code, content, or final visual product of the other. The researchers found that data compression that both internal and discrete GPUs use to improve performance acts as a [side channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) that they can abuse to bypass the restriction and steal pixels one by one.

“We found that modern GPUs automatically try to compress this visual data, without any application involvement,” Yingchen Wang, the lead author and a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in an email. “This is done to save memory bandwidth and improve performance. Since compressibility is data dependent, this optimization creates a side channel which can be exploited by an attacker to reveal information about the visual data.”

For GPU.zip to work, a malicious page must be loaded into the Chrome or Edge browsers. Under-the-hood differences in the way Firefox and Safari work prevent the attack from succeeding when those browsers process an attack page. Another requirement is that the page linked to in the iframe must not be configured to deny being embedded by cross-origin websites.

The security threats that can result when HTML is embedded in iframes on malicious websites have been well-known for more than a decade. Most websites [restrict the cross-origin embedding](https://web.dev/security-headers/) of pages displaying user names, passwords, or other sensitive content through X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers. Not all, however, do. One example is Wikipedia, which shows the usernames of people who log in to their accounts. A person who wants to remain anonymous while visiting a site they don’t trust could be outed if it contained an iframe containing a link to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page`.

The researchers showed how GPU.zip allows a malicious website they created for their PoC to steal pixels one by one for a user’s Wikipedia username. The attack works on GPUs provided by Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Arm, and Nvidia. On AMD’s Ryzen 7 4800U, GPU.zip took about 30 minutes to render the targeted pixels with 97 percent accuracy. The attack required 215 minutes to reconstruct the pixels when displayed on a system running an Intel i7-8700.

All of the GPUs analyzed use proprietary forms of compression to optimize the bandwidth available in the memory data bus of the PC, phone, or other device displaying the targeted content. The compression schemes differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and are undocumented, so the researchers reverse-engineered each one. The insights yielded a method that uses the SVG, or the scalable vector graphics image format, to maximize differences in DRAM traffic between black and white target pixels in the presence of compression. While their paper discusses GPU.zip as it applies to iGPUs, or internal GPUs, the technique applies equally to standalone or discrete GPUs as well.

In their paper, the researchers wrote:

> We demonstrate that an attacker can exploit the iGPU-based compression channel to perform cross-origin pixel stealing attacks in the browser using SVG filters (the latest version of Google Chrome as of April 2023), even though SVG filters are implemented at constant time. The reason is that the attacker can create highly redundant or highly non-redundant patterns depending on a single secret pixel in the browser. As these patterns are processed by the iGPU, their varying degrees of redundancy cause the lossless compression output to depend on the secret pixel. The data-dependent compression output directly translates to data-dependent DRAM traffic and data-dependent cache occupancy. Consequently, we show that, even under the most passive threat model—where an attacker can only observe coarse-grained redundancy information of a pattern using a coarse-grained timer in the browser and lacks the ability to adaptively select input—individual pixels can be leaked. Our proof-of-concept attack succeeds on a range of devices (including computers, phones) from a variety of hardware vendors with distinct GPU architectures (Intel, AMD, Apple, Nvidia). Surprisingly, our attack also succeeds on discrete GPUs, and we have preliminary results indicating the presence of software-transparent compression on those architectures as well.

## A threat now? Probably not. But...

Data compression is a common feature for increasing the performance of software and hardware. It uses complex math to represent redundancies in a file or chunk of data and reduce the number of bits it has. Compression has also been a common side channel that forms the cornerstone of several attacks over the past decade. Examples include: the [CRIME](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions/), or Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy, exploit for decrypting some HTTPS traffic; another attack on HTTPS encryption known as [BREACH](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/gone-in-30-seconds-new-attack-plucks-secrets-from-https-protected-pages/), short for Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext; an attack known as [VORACLE](https://openvpn.net/security-advisory/the-voracle-attack-vulnerability/) from 2018; and, in 2021, the [Practical Timing Side-Channel Attacks on Memory Compression](https://gruss.cc/files/timingcompression.pdf).

As noted earlier, GPU.zip works only when the malicious attacker website is loaded into Chrome or Edge. The reason: For the attack to work, the browser must:

1. allow cross-origin iframes to be loaded with cookies
2. allow rendering SVG filters on iframes and
3. delegate rendering tasks to the GPU

A Google representative didn’t say whether the company had plans to change the behavior of Chrome in response to the findings.

“This is impactful research on how hardware works,” the representative said. “Widely adopted headers can prevent sites from being embedded, which prevents this attack, and sites using the default `SameSite=Lax` cookie behavior receive significant mitigation against personalized data being leaked. These protections, along with the difficulty and time required to exploit this behavior, significantly mitigate the threat to everyday users. We are in communication and are actively engaging with the reporting researchers. We are always looking to further improve protections for Chrome users.”

An Intel representative, meanwhile, said in an email that the chipmaker has “assessed the researcher findings that were provided and determined the root cause is not in our GPUs but in third-party software.” A Qualcomm representative said “the issue isn’t in our threat model as it more directly affects the browser and can be resolved by the browser application if warranted, so no changes are currently planned.” Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and ARM didn’t provide an on-the-record comment when this post went live.

For now, GPU.zip is more of a curiosity than a real threat, but that assumes that Web developers properly restrict sensitive pages from being embedded by cross-origin websites. End users who want to check if a page has such restrictions in place should look for the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers in the source. To do that:

1. Open the webpage
2. Open the developer console
3. Reload the webpage
4. Go to the network tab and check the main document request
5. See if X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy are set there

Checking www.gmail.com shows that X-Frame-Options is set to SAMEORIGIN. Checking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main\_Page, however, shows that no such header is set.

Tuesday’s [research paper](https://www.hertzbleed.com/gpu.zip/GPU-zip.pdf) will be presented at the 45th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, scheduled for May in San Francisco. The researchers have an informational write-up [here](https://www.hertzbleed.com/gpu.zip). While the current threat posed by GPU.zip is low, the research and the surprising findings it yields are nonetheless important for people designing hardware and software.

“There are also reasons beyond just pixel stealing why people might want to care about this,” Wang said. “First, GPU.zip might enable other, yet-to-be-discovered attacks beyond pixel stealing that bear greater risk to end users. Second, GPU.zip is yet another example of a hardware optimization creating a side channel that software is ill-positioned to mitigate. This highlights, once again, that we users need to re-think our confidence in hardware as a root of trust.”

> I feel like I'm missing something, how does the webpage infer what the GPU is doing?

It applies a filter over the webpage and measures how long it takes to draw. By trying different patterns it can infer what's being drawn over because the GPU will take different amounts of time to draw it depending on what it's drawing over.
