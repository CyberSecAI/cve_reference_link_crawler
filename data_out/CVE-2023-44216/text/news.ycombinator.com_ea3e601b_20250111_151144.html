I wouldn't call it beautiful, it's more like a well-considered thorough engineering tour-de-force. I'm horrified but applaud the team. Here's how it works: a stack of SVG filters is created. These filters are constructed so that they will tend to be faster processing a dark pixel than they will be processing a light pixel. An iframe is loaded up by the attacking site, pointing at, say, a banking site or some other target of interest. I couldn't find exact details, and my HTML skills are rusty, but I assume the iframe is a 1x1 pixel iframe, and given a pixel offset. The SVG stack is loaded onto the iframe using CSS, then unloaded, then loaded, etc. a whole bunch of times, and average timing results are assessed. Based on these average times, the pixel is marked 'dark' or 'light'. Repeat for each pixel. Average time per pixel is in the 1-2 second range. Per pixel. So, this is a slow attack. It could probably get an order of magnitude faster with a sort of combo of zooming and greyscale heuristics that resolves over time, though. They have a number of cool graphs showing the broad spread of times, and it does look easy to distinguish; their success varies by architecture, but it's over 96% for almost every architecture they test. They show it works while multiple videos and other things that tax the GPU are playing. Proposed fix: let browsers tell the GPU they need some variant of constant-time processing for an iframe. Which is super, super gross. Safari and Firefox don't currently allow cross-site iframe injection, so the attack only works on Chromium-line browsers. Again, eww. And, wow! | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [twelvechairs](user?id=twelvechairs) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37666765)   | [parent](#37666516) | [next](#37666560) [–]  Why isn't the proposed fix "don't allow cross-site iframe injection"?

I don't see why they're not extended to all these other attack vectors: WebGPU, WebRTC, canvas, Web Audio, iframes, precise timing functions, WASM etc. Most sites don't need any of these features so why not make them opt-in and per-site? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nicce](user?id=nicce) [on Sept 27, 2023](item?id=37671652)   | [root](#37666516) | [parent](#37671569) | [next](#37666841) [–]  95% of the people have no idea what they mean and just click yes. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevingadd](user?id=kevingadd) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37666841)   | [root](#37666516) | [parent](#37666765) | [prev](#37671569) | [next](#37666560) [–]  disabling CSS/SVG filters for cross-site content also seems like a pretty reasonable thing to do | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chatmasta](user?id=chatmasta) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37667600)   | [root](#37666516) | [parent](#37666841) | [next](#37667107) [–]  Yeah, it seems like that would mitigate most of the issues. At the very least, Chrome could introduce and respect a CSP flag on the iframed site that indicates it can be iframed but not with SVG filters. That wouldn't sacrifice backward compatibility but would at least allow sites to opt out of the behavior (and into extra security protection). (And I say "Chrome," not "browsers," because it's the only browser that satisfies the three prerequisites of the attack, one of which is adding SVG filters to iframes, as described in the site/paper). On the other hand, it would be more effective in reverse, i.e. to require iframed sites to opt-*in* to allowing host sites to apply SVG/CSS filters to them. Sure, this would break backward compatibility. But who cares? What is the reason for the strong attachment to SVG filters on iframes? Is this a common use case? When is it beneficial? For the other described prerequisites of the attack, like allowing embedding iframes with third-party cookies inside them, I understand the use case (although if we're being honest this is mostly because of Google wanting to retain YouTube tracking). But SVG filters on iframes?

Perhaps even without GPU rendering there'd be similar side channels available, but at least they'd be "software visible" (to use the words of the paper) rather than "software transparent." Something I didn't understand from my skimming of the paper, though: does this side channel only apply to windows/iframes within the same browser? Why couldn't it apply to windows of different apps? If the GPU rendered a frame buffer somewhere on the screen, then is that exposed by the attack, regardless of whether it's within the browser? e.g. could Chrome.app identify some pixels from a PDF open in Preview.app? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevingadd](user?id=kevingadd) [on Sept 27, 2023](item?id=37668634)   | [root](#37666516) | [parent](#37667743) | [next](#37667904) [–]  Normally pixels belonging to other processes aren't visible to you. There have been incidents in the past where (usually due to a driver bug) processes could grab pixels from other processes' textures/render targets, but normally you're only supposed to be able to get those pixels by asking the OS (usually its compositor specifically) for them. I think this side channel partly relies on being able to stack the iframe on top of attacker-controlled image content. Preview.app will be at an unknown position on the screen, and the Chrome.app window could also be at any position and move, so it's much harder to imagine a way to apply this attack in that scenario. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [autoexec](user?id=autoexec) [on Sept 27, 2023](item?id=37667904)   | [root](#37666516) | [parent](#37666848) | [prev](#37667743) | [next](#37668672) [–]  It's not the first time SVG has caused problems.

These filters are constructed so that they will tend to be faster processing a dark pixel than they will be processing a light pixel. Why/how is that a thing?

The paper explains how the GPU stores pixels in memory in a losslessly compressed format in order to speed up data transfers. And the filter stack is designed so that a dark pixel input produces an all-black output (very compressible), while a light pixel input produces noise as output (very incompressible).

It's possible this just works because it happened to work, and nobody ever went out of their way to implement it. i.e. the display list for the page has some boxes for iframes, and those boxes are identical to the rasterizer regardless of what origin they're from, so it happily applies filters to all of the iframes. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vimax](user?id=vimax) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37666649)   | [root](#37663199) | [parent](#37665519) | [prev](#37666217) | [next](#37666100) [–]  You seem knowledgeable on this. Why is only chrome supporting this feature and other browsers aren’t? Was this feature pushed by the chrome team? As for your second point, how is this not a vulnerability in the browser? The security intent is clear, a page should not be able to inspect an iframe. I can’t take a screenshot and read the pixels of the iframe. The fact the chromium supports a published standard is irrelevant. The browser exposes information it is not supposed to and is vulnerable to attack. The intent of the css feature was not to allow reading iframe pixels. If that cannot be avoided, then the feature is insecure and any browser implementing it has a vulnerability. If it can be avoided then chrome has an insecure implementation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevingadd](user?id=kevingadd) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37666896)   | [root](#37663199) | [parent](#37666649) | [next](#37666881) [–]  I don't have any reason to believe that the Chrome team pushed for this use case specifically. In the past when I experimented with SVG filters their feature support was already very different across Trident Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, as was their implementation (hardware accelerated vs not). SVG filters are very powerful and also very slow, and not necessarily constant-time, so they're a good target if you're trying to execute a timing attack. (For whatever reason, my old JSIL project actually happened to use SVG filters to accelerate a specific use case...) I think it would be fair to call it an oversight that Chromium allows cross-origin use of the features involved in this attack, but it doesn't really feel like a vulnerability in the traditional sense to me - everything is working as intended/specified AFAIK. It just happens to expose a timing attack. The reality is that tons of things are potential timing attacks and if every single feature that might get used for one was disabled in advance the web platform would be pretty useless. There are various constraints you could apply to make attacks like this harder - i.e. limiting filter stacks to say 4 items, limiting use of filters cross-origin - but I find it understandable that such things didn't happen. This functionality is probably also quite old so it's possible nobody was taking timing attacks quite as seriously back then. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [c22](user?id=c22) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37667351)   | [root](#37663199) | [parent](#37666896) | [next](#37666881) [–]  *> The reality is that tons of things are potential timing attacks and if every single feature that might get used for one was disabled in advance the web platform would be pretty useless.* I feel like the web platform would be much more *useful* if I didn't have to constantly worry about drive-by attacks leveraging bugs in a giant stack of "web technologies" that are only getting more complex with each passing year. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [beebeepka](user?id=beebeepka) [on Sept 26, 2023](item?id=37666881)   | [root](#37663199) | [parent](#37666649) | [prev](#37666896) | [next](#37666100) [–]  Interesting points.

I suspect that's the sort of security framework that will solve a lot of the problems. Do not run untrusted code by default. Have the user to enable a site (often during account creation / sign in on a new device). Have the user 'click play' if they expect something to work. Make sites that just work without client side code again. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [asddubs](user?id=asddubs) [on Sept 27, 2023](item?id=37670651)   | [parent](#37666057) | [prev](#37666450) | [next](#37669072) [–]  it would be enough to disallow/containerize third party cookies, like pretty much every browser besides chrome does | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jefftk](user?id=jefftk) [on Sept 27, 2023](item?id=37669072)   | [parent](#37666057) | [prev](#37670651) | [next](#37666152) [–]  Do away with iFrames and we'll have ads running same-origin to content.
