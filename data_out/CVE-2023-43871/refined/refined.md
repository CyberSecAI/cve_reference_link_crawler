The provided content relates to CVE-2023-43871.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitation during media file uploads, specifically with PDF files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Arbitrary File Upload: The system allows uploading files without adequate validation.
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The system does not properly sanitize uploaded PDF files allowing hidden XSS payloads within them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can upload a malicious PDF file containing an XSS payload, which will then execute when the PDF is accessed, allowing for arbitrary script execution in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker gains access to the CMS panel.
- The attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file with hidden XSS payload using the media upload functionality.
- When the PDF is accessed the XSS payload is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the WBCE CMS panel, likely with privileges to upload media files.
