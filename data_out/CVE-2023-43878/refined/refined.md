Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when creating or editing menu items within the Rite CMS administration panel. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Name', 'Title', 'Link', and 'Accesskey' fields when adding or modifying menu items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means malicious scripts are persistently stored within the application's database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive user information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is network-based, through the web interface.
    - The attacker targets the "Administration - Menus - Main Menu" section of the Rite CMS admin panel.
    - Specifically, the injection points are the Name, Title, Link, and Accesskey fields when adding or editing a menu item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to have at least a low-privileged account with access to the administrative panel to perform this attack
   -  The attacker must be able to create or edit menu items in the "Main Menu".
   - No special skills are required other than knowledge of XSS payloads.

**Additional details:**
The provided text includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) and example images demonstrating the injection of the XSS payload and its execution within the web interface. The following XSS payload was used: `'"><svg/onload=propmt('Name')>`. The PoC shows that when this payload is stored in any of the vulnerable fields and the main menu is rendered the javascript code gets executed.
