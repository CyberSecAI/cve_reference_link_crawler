### Description

The Blog, Posts and Category Filter for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Post and Category Filter widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied 'post\_types' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Although i’ve have this plugin installed and active on my development site for some time, I haven’t really been using it, I’m not certain it does what I need it to do, so I cannot give a full and fair review. However, I also can’t get the banner asking me to review it to go away! So you get a 3-start “average” review. If I wind up using and liking it (or not) I’ll update my review.

If you use this plugin you no longer can rely on default category paths working! So if you are looking to link to your Category directly – you CANNOT! Not good design/Not good for SEO
