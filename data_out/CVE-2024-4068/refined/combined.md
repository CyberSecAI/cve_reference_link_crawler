Fixes [#36](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/36)

<https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BRACES-6838727>

* ‚úÖ Split to a couple chunks, which is better for speed in modern engines;
* ‚úÖ Move out nested loop;
* ‚úÖ Flatten blocks, then mark imbalanced;
* ‚úÖ Remove parents from blocks, since they don't needed in flatten structure (less memory consumption);

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This questionable security issue relates to exponential complexity when parsing `{` or `}` characters to sanitize the input.

| First, I want to mention that I don't take this lightly and I do think it's very important to resolve vulnerabilities quickly. I've just reviewed the PR, which probably shouldn't have been merged, and I very carefully reviewed the code and the snyk report. The problem  * There are 2,162,688 valid characters in JavaScript. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/72b103bf45c35027f55463156ce79180) * This PR provides a way of preventing a specific character from being used more than `maxSymbols` times in the string. Which means you'd be able to pass 1024 characters 2,162,688 times (that is, if the `maxLength` option didn't already exist).   Since the PR won't solve the problem, and it introduces some performance degradations (like looping over the entire string again instead of counting in the parser where it's already done; not breaking when the max is reached, etc), I'm not going to publish this.  I would, however, consider adding support for `process.env.MAX_BRACES_LENGTH` or something like that, so that you can guarantee that this is respected by any `braces` in the tree (but that will only work for the new version and higher). Another thing I would consider is just setting the `maxLength` to a much lower default number, like 10,000, which braces handles in 0.008s. The bigger problem  1. AFAIK (please correct me if I'm wrong), this particular "vulnerability" could only be exploited by someone who controls your dependencies, or a team member? I'm interested in understanding how a supply chain library that is almost exclusively used in `devDependencies` would be exploited by someone who isn't in control of the code. 2. If an implementor somewhere in the dependency tree was so inclined, there are much easier ways to cause catastrophic problems that defining inefficient brace patterns, which I'll not list here, and there is no way to prevent that from happening (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/72b103bf45c35027f55463156ce79180)).  Moving forward I'd be happy to merge in a PR that does something like what I suggested earlier.  As final thoughts, these types of reports place a huge burden on maintainers like me, and while both snyk and the vulnerability-finders get paid a lot of $ for finding any possible thing that can be labeled a vulnerability (and they are incentivized to lower that bar as far as possible), none of the dollars go to open source maintainers - and it shouldn't in this case, because that would create a bigger problem.  However, the companies that use open source and benefit from it are another story. I love the community and love open source, but I find it absurd to see people from companies like IBM on this thread complaining about my responsiveness to the issue, whilst doing nothing to solve the real problem, which is a lack of funding. It's disheartening to see someone complain about me not spending time on this, and then actively trying to hurt my reputation or ask people to switch away from my projects, instead of caring if I get compensated equitably for my time, or if I'm struggling to pay my bills. |

| [@archanasharma3](https://github.com/archanasharma3) could you provide the error you're seeing when the heap limit is reached and your program crashes?  The pattern length is checked [here](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/blob/98414f9f1fabe021736e26836d8306d5de747e0d/lib/parse.js#L37-L40). You could either check the pattern length before passing it to `braces` or handle the error in a try-catch.  There's also [an option](https://github.com/micromatch/braces?tab=readme-ov-file#optionsmaxlength) that will enforce a lower max length if you'd like to do that and catch the error. |

| Hello [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb),  I'm reaching out here to confirm that this is indeed the other vulnerability reported by the Checkmarx CxResearch group. We opened this issue ([micromatch/micromatch#243](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/243)) after trying to reach out by email unsuccessfully. You can still find the details in the report we sent.  CVEs for both vulnerabilities will come out soon.  Thank you, M√°rio Teixeira |

| It looks like the description of this vulnerability is around the do/while loop for the imbalanced braces:  ``` The NPM package "braces" fails to limit the number of characters it can handle,  which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In "lib/parse.js," if a malicious user sends  "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the  program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the  loop.

| [@sdupont73](https://github.com/sdupont73) -- I'm going to guess that the answer to "when is a fix coming" is probably **never**. The last commit to this repository was 2019. Same goes for the npm. I do not maintain this project, so I don't actually **know**, but we've not heard anything from the maintainers and there seems to be very little development effort, so my guess is that a replacement is a better option. |

| Hi,  We did a PoC and can confirm that version 3.0.3 fixed the issue for [CVE-2024-4068](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4068).  However, as stated [here](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/249#issuecomment-2125404806), the ReDoS vulnerability ([CVE-2024-4067](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4067)) still exists and can potentially be exploited if a certain library is calling the vulnerable method.

# Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop in braces

## CVE-2024-4068

* braces

![]()
![]()
![]()
Severity High

Score 7.5/10

## Summary

The NPM package "braces", versions prior to 3.0.3, fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In "lib/parse.js," if a malicious user sends "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will¬†crash.

* Attack Complexity:
  LOW

  NETWORK
* Integrity Impact:
  NONE
* Scope:
  UNCHANGED
* User Interaction:
  NONE
* Privileges Required:

* Confidentiality Impact:

* Availability Impact:
  HIGH

## CWE-1050 - Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop

The software has a loop body or loop condition that contains a control element that directly or indirectly consumes platform resources, e.g. messaging, sessions, locks, or file¬†descriptors.

Loved this comment [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) : [#37 (comment)](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37#issuecomment-2121649614)

I have a bias for explicit configuration closer to the process - rather than an env var. Are we happy with simply lowering it?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@thanhnhan2tn](https://github.com/thanhnhan2tn) do you mean the flagged security vulnerability in Snyk/Blackduck/et al? You'll need to talk to your security vendor and have them fix it on their end, as maintainers of OSS software cannot do that for you |
