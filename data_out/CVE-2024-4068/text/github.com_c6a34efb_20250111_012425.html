| [@archanasharma3](https://github.com/archanasharma3) could you provide the error you're seeing when the heap limit is reached and your program crashes?  The pattern length is checked [here](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/blob/98414f9f1fabe021736e26836d8306d5de747e0d/lib/parse.js#L37-L40). You could either check the pattern length before passing it to `braces` or handle the error in a try-catch.  There's also [an option](https://github.com/micromatch/braces?tab=readme-ov-file#optionsmaxlength) that will enforce a lower max length if you'd like to do that and catch the error. |

| Hello [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb),  I'm reaching out here to confirm that this is indeed the other vulnerability reported by the Checkmarx CxResearch group. We opened this issue ([micromatch/micromatch#243](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/243)) after trying to reach out by email unsuccessfully. You can still find the details in the report we sent.  CVEs for both vulnerabilities will come out soon.  Thank you, M√°rio Teixeira |

| It looks like the description of this vulnerability is around the do/while loop for the imbalanced braces:  ``` The NPM package "braces" fails to limit the number of characters it can handle,  which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In "lib/parse.js," if a malicious user sends  "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the  program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the  loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.  ``` |

| [@sdupont73](https://github.com/sdupont73) -- I'm going to guess that the answer to "when is a fix coming" is probably **never**. The last commit to this repository was 2019. Same goes for the npm. I do not maintain this project, so I don't actually **know**, but we've not heard anything from the maintainers and there seems to be very little development effort, so my guess is that a replacement is a better option. |

| Hi,  We did a PoC and can confirm that version 3.0.3 fixed the issue for [CVE-2024-4068](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4068).  However, as stated [here](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/249#issuecomment-2125404806), the ReDoS vulnerability ([CVE-2024-4067](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4067)) still exists and can potentially be exploited if a certain library is calling the vulnerable method.  Best regards, M√°rio Teixeira |
