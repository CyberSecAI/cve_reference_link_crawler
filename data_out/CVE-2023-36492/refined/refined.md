Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-36492**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `calendar[path]` parameter in a URL.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser session when they are logged into the application.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within the `calendar[path]` parameter.
    2.  The attacker tricks the victim into visiting the malicious URL, for example, through a phishing campaign
    3.  The victim then needs to click on a button labelled "Return to Calendar". This is when the malicious javascript will be executed.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it while being logged into the vulnerable application.
