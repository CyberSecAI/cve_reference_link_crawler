Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromDhcpSetSer` function of the Tenda i21 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into the `dhcpscfg` buffer, but it doesn't properly check the length of the input, allowing an attacker to write past the end of the allocated buffer on the stack.
*   **Unvalidated User Input:** The `dhcpStartIp, dhcpEndIp, dhcpGw, dhcpMask, dhcpLeaseTime, dhcpDns1, dhcpDns2` parameters are received from a POST request and directly used in the `sprintf` without proper length validation. The `ssidIndex` parameter also influences this process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The stack overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow payload, an attacker could overwrite return addresses or other control data, allowing them to execute malicious code on the router.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow could cause the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/DhcpSetSer` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the IP address of the router.
* No specific authentication is mentioned, so it's assumed that this vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user on the local network, or remote attacker if the web interface is exposed to the internet.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable firmware version is i21 V1.0.0.14(4656).
*   The `dhcpscfg` variable is a buffer on the stack, and it's overflowed by the user-provided input parameters.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to cause a crash with an overflow payload in the `dhcpStartIp` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the following VulDB entry ID: 262142
