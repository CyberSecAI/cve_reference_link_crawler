Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user inputs in the `add_new_medicine.php` script within the Pharmacy Management System version 1.0. Specifically, the `name`, `packing`, `generic_name`, and `suppliers_name` parameters are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to potential database compromise.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information, including supplier details, can be exposed.
- **System Disruption:** Key pharmaceutical operations can be disrupted, affecting the functionality and availability of the system.
- **Data Breaches:** Exploitation can result in significant data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the vulnerable parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to craft HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in the parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/php/add_new_medicine.php`.
- The vulnerable parameters are `name`, `packing`, `generic_name`, and `suppliers_name`.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the injection through the `name` parameter.
- The PoC includes a sleep function to confirm the successful injection: `name%3da'%20AND%20(SELECT%207103%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))XkQj)--%20DYIO`

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is reported as CRITICAL and currently unpatched.
- Screenshots of Burp Suite and SQLMap exploits are provided as visual confirmation of the vulnerability.
