- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `audio_merchant_add_audio_file` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires tricking a site administrator into performing an action like clicking on a malicious link, which would trigger a forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a site administrator into performing an action. They do not need to be authenticated.
