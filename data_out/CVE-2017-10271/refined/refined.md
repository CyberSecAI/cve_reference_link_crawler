  "CVE-2017-10271": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the 'wls-wsat' component of Oracle WebLogic Server, which is susceptible to XML deserialization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe deserialization of XML data, leading to remote command execution.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable WebLogic component.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted SOAP message to the `/wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType` endpoint.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unauthenticated XML deserialization in the `wls-wsat` component.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The server improperly handles XML data leading to deserialization.",

      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted SOAP request to `/wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType`.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the WebLogic server's `/wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType` endpoint."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the processing of SOAP messages by the `wls-wsat` component.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XML deserialization, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker full control of the vulnerable server.",
