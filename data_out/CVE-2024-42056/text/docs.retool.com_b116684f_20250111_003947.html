# Self-hosted Retool releases

Release notes for self-hosted Retool.

You can [deploy a self-hosted instance of Retool](/self-hosted/tutorials) on your own infrastructure, such as a virtual private cloud (VPC). There are two release channels for self-hosted versions of Retool:

* [Stable](#stable): A new release every 13 weeks (quarterly).
* [Edge](#edge): A new release every week.

Unless you need access to the latest features and have the ability to upgrade frequently, Retool strongly recommends that you use the Stable channel.

Stable and Edge release channels were introduced on February 27, 2024. All prior releases are considered legacy.

Retool supports Legacy releases for six months from their initial release date. During this time, Retool will release patch updates that contain bug fixes or security updates. Patch updates do not contain functionality changes and can be applied more quickly than performing a full version upgrade.

After six months, a Legacy release is deprecated. You can continue using a deprecated release but it will no longer receive updates. At this time, you should upgrade to the latest Stable or Edge release.

## Stable release channel[​](#stable "Direct link to Stable release channel")

Retool releases a version on the [Stable](/releases/stable) channel every 13 weeks (quarterly). A Stable release is generally four versions behind the cloud-hosted version at the time.

Preparation and testing of a Stable version occurs approximately four weeks prior to its release. Stable releases are rigorously tested before they are published. As the release cycle is less frequent, administrators can more easily maintain and upgrade deployments.

Retool supports each Stable release for six months. During this time, Retool will release patch updates that contain bug fixes or security updates. Patch updates do not contain functionality changes and can be applied more quickly than performing a full version upgrade.

Retool provides versioned product documentation for supported Stable releases. When browsing Retool Docs, use the version dropdown menu in the navbar to switch to a relevant version.

After six months, a Stable release is considered deprecated. You can continue using a deprecated release but it will no longer receive updates. At this time, you should upgrade to the latest Stable release.

## Edge release channel[​](#edge "Direct link to Edge release channel")

Releases on the [Edge](/releases/edge) channel occur weekly. Each release occurs one week after the equivalent release for cloud-hosted Retool.

Edge releases are available for organizations that want the latest features or to use private beta functionality. Retool recommends most organizations use [Stable](/releases/stable) releases unless you have a specific need for Edge releases and can keep your deployment up-to-date.

Retool supports only the most recent release on the Edge channel. As Edge releases are weekly, bug fixes and improvements are included in the next release. All previous releases are then considered deprecated.

## Update to a newer release[​](#update-to-a-newer-release "Direct link to Update to a newer release")

Retool recommends you upgrade a deployment instance using releases from the same channel. For example, if you currently use a Stable release, upgrade to newer releases in the Stable channel.

Cross-channel upgrades can potentially result in a regression or loss of functionality. If you want to use a version of Retool from another channel, Retool recommends you deploy the release separately and then migrate your existing deployment.

### Database migrations[​](#database-migrations "Direct link to Database migrations")

The upgrade process may include database migrations that run once the deployment instance restarts. Your instance may take longer to start during this time.

### Upgrade a legacy deployment[​](#upgrade-a-legacy-deployment "Direct link to Upgrade a legacy deployment")

You can upgrade a deployment instance that currently uses a legacy release to a Stable or Edge release. Before doing so, determine which channel you want to use and then perform the upgrade. In general, Retool recommends using the Stable release channel.

## Release versioning[​](#release-versioning "Direct link to Release versioning")

Releases use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for versions using the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-CHANNEL`.

* `MAJOR.MINOR` refers to the release (e.g., `3.33`).
* `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` refers to a specific version of the release (e.g., `3.33.1`).
* `CHANNEL` refers to the release channel. Either `stable` or `edge`.

Retool will release `PATCH` version updates (e.g., `3.47.2-stable`) if necessary. Whether you upgrade to a new release or perform an update of an existing one, always specify the full semantic version number you want to use.
