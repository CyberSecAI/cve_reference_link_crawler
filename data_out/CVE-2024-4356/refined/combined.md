### Description

The List categories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'categories' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## Description

Simple plugin to display categories in any post or page with a shortcode. It’s basically a shortcode API interface to the [wp\_list\_categories](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_list_categories/) WordPress function. This means given any of the [parameters](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_list_categories/#parameters) accepted by the function, you can pass it in as a shortcode parameter to the `categories` shortcode.

Usage:

```
[categories orderby=count]

```

Will display links to all the categories and order them by number of posts in each category.

You can also **list tags** or any other WordPress taxonomy. You need to pass a value to the `taxonomy` parameter. For example to list tags: `[categories taxonomy=post_tag title_li="Tags"]`.

By default, the usage shows:

* No link to all categories
* Sorts the list of Categories by the Category name in ascending order
* Displayed in an unordered list style
* Does not show the post count
* Displays only Categories with posts
* Sets the title attribute to the Category Description
* Is not restricted to the child\_of any Category
* No feed or feed image used
* Does not exclude any Category and includes all Categories
* Displays the active Category with the CSS Class-Suffix ‘ current-cat’
* Shows the Categories in hierarchical indented fashion
* Display Category as the heading over the list
* No SQL LIMIT is imposed (‘number’ => 0 is not shown above)
* Displays (echos) the categories
* No limit to depth
* All categories.
* The list is rendered using a new walker object of the the Walker\_Category class

See [wp\_list\_categories](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_list_categories/) for usage.

### Markup and Styling of Category Lists

Taken from the [wp\_list\_categories official documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories#Markup_and_Styling_of_Category_Lists).

By default, wp\_list\_categories() generates nested unordered lists (ul) within a single list item (li) titled “Categories”.

You can remove the outermost item and list by setting the title\_li parameter to an empty string. You’ll need to wrap the output in an ordered list (ol) or unordered list yourself (see the examples above). If you don’t want list output at all, set the style parameter to none.

You can style the output with these CSS selectors :

```
li.categories { ... }  /* outermost list item */
li.cat-item { ... }
li.cat-item-7 { ... }  /* category ID #7, etc */
li.current-cat { ... }
li.current-cat-parent { ... }
ul.children { ... }

```
### Show categories list in columns

For outputting the list into columns, you can use [CSS’s multicolumns](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1/). Since by default the list is printed as an unordered list with the “categories” class, you can add this to your CSS:

```
.categories{
    column-count: 5;
    column-gap: 50px;
}

```

## Installation

* Upload the plugin’s directory into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
