Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-18652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in the `WEBP::VP8XChunk::VP8XChunk` function within `WEBP_Support.cpp`.
*   The code attempts to read width and height data from a bitstream, assuming a minimum size of 10 bytes is allocated. However, if the bitstream is smaller than expected, for example, 6 bytes, the read operations at indices 6, 7, 8 and 9 will cause an out-of-bounds read.
*   Specifically, the issue arises because the `VP8XChunk` constructor initializes the chunk's size to 10 but doesn't check if the underlying data buffer has at least 10 bytes before reading from it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** Reading beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Insufficient size check:** The code fails to validate that the bitstream is large enough before accessing it.
*   **Potential for Denial of Service (DoS):** The over-read can lead to crashes and application termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  A crafted WebP image can trigger a crash, making the application unusable, leading to DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebP file:** An attacker can craft a malicious WebP file with a truncated image data to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing the crafted WebP file, specifically during the parsing of the VP8X chunk, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted WebP file:** The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted WebP file to a system using the vulnerable software (exempi).
*   No special system access is required, the user must only be able to process the crafted file with vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) report provides specific details of the crash, including the memory address and source code location.
*   The vulnerability is similar to a previously reported bug (CVE-2018-7731), suggesting an incomplete fix of a similar issue.
* The fix is mentioned as commit `acee2894` in the second gitlab content excerpt.
* Debian LTS also addressed the issue in their security advisory DLA-3585-1.
