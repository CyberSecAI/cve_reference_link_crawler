- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of matching symbols in the PAN-OS command line interface (CLI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of wildcards or matching symbols (CWE-155) allows for arbitrary file reads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the CLI can read arbitrary files on the firewall.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the PAN-OS CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated administrator access (including read-only) to the CLI.
