**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Layout module's SEO configuration, specifically how the `backURL` parameter is handled. This parameter is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being included in the page output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the victim's browser session
- This can lead to malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacing websites
    - Gaining unauthorized access to user information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a crafted URL containing the malicious payload in the `_com_liferay_layout_admin_web_portlet_GroupPagesPortlet_backURL` parameter.
- The attacker can deliver the malicious URL to a victim through various means, such as email, links in web pages, or social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to click on a malicious link containing the crafted URL.
- The user needs to visit the crafted URL.
