- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution by injecting a payload into a page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker having the victim's browser carry out actions on the attacker's behalf. This could include executing arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low privileges (PR:L), user interaction(UI:R) and high attack complexity (AC:H) where an attacker injects a payload into a page that a user then visits.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious payload into a page that a user will access. This implies the attacker needs some level of access to the system or the ability to manipulate the system's data or code.
