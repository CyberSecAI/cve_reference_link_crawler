| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Can the issue be reproduced with the default theme (daylight/midnight)?  * I was able to reproduce the issue with the default theme  Could the issue be due to extensions?  * I've ruled out the possibility that the extension is causing the problem.  Describe the problem A type check was missing when handling fonts in PDF.js, which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the PDF.js context. If pdf.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with isEvalSupported set to true (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain. PoC  1. Download latest Siyuan-3.1.0 app 2. Create new document, and directly insert a malicious PDF document that has been created。    [poc-rce.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16170964/poc-rce.pdf) 3. Open Later，The calculator poped up.
