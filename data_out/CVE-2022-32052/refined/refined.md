- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FUN_004137a4` function in `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` copies the `desc` JSON parameter to a local stack variable without checking its length, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow due to missing length validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack, which could lead to full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON request to the web component of the router with a long value for the `desc` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
