<ul>
<li>When forking a repository, users can choose to only include the repository's default branch in the fork.</li>
<li>Users can use a repository's' <strong>Fork</strong> button to see existing forks of the repository.</li>
<li>The <strong>Fetch upstream</strong> button has been renamed to <strong>Sync fork</strong> to better describe the button's behavior. If the sync causes a conflict, the web UI prompts the user to contribute changes to the parent repository, discard changes, or resolve the conflict.</li>
<li>To address situations where people work within one organization and don't want to fork a repository to a different organization or user account, users can fork a repository to the same organization as the parent repository.</li>
<li>Users can fork an internal repository to another organization and the fork will retain internal visibility. When forking an internal repository, users can choose which organization should own the fork.</li>
</ul>

This change adds support for migrations where the Git source or metadata is larger than 1 GB.\n","To help users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license better understand detected secrets and take action, secret scanning alerts concerning third-party API keys now include a link to the provider's documentation.

When mentioning users, the Dependabot user account now appears as an autocomplete suggestion.\n","In repositories with vulnerable dependencies, Dependabot will no longer display a yellow banner. To notify contributors of vulnerable dependencies, the **Security** tab displays an alert counter.\n","If a user forks a repository with an existing Dependabot configuration in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot updates will be disabled in the fork by default.

To save time, pull requests for Dependabot version updates will now automatically update the semantic version in these comments.\n","JavaScript developers who use Node.js, npm, and Dependabot security updates can save time when updating npm projects with transitive dependencies.\n\n- Dependabot can update both parent and child dependencies together. Previously, Dependabot would not update transitive dependencies when the parent required an incompatible specific version range, requiring manual upgrades.\n- Dependabot can create pull requests that resolve alerts where an update to a direct dependency would remove the vulnerable transitive dependency from the tree.\n\nFor more information, see \"[About Dependabot security updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).\"\n","For people who use Dependabot for version updates in the Docker ecosystem, Dependabot will proactively update Docker image tags in Kubernetes manifests.

The `workflow_job` webhook supports a new `waiting` state whenever a job is awaiting an environment protection rule. Also, when a job refers to an `environment` key in its YAML definition, the `workflow_job` webhook payload will also include a new property, `deployment`. `deployment` contains metadata about the deployment that the check run created.
