{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'give_title' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject a PHP object which can trigger a POP chain leading to remote code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
       "Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection"
     , "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can achieve remote code execution and arbitrary file deletion, potentially leading to full site compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via the 'give_title' parameter during the donation process when user data is unserialized and processed, which can be exploited with a maliciously crafted serialized PHP object.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker does not need any authentication or special position. They need to send a request containing the malicious payload as the value of the ‘give_title’ parameter to trigger the vulnerability. A working POP chain is also required."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2024-5932",
  "additional_notes": "The Wordfence blog provides additional information that was not present in the CVE description, including the detailed workings of the vulnerability and the specific POP chain used for exploitation, as well as the vendor's response timeline and remediation guidance."
