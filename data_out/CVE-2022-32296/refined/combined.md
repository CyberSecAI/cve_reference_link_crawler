# RFC 6056 Device Tracker

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a device tracking technique for Linux-based devices by exploiting Algorithm 4 ("Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm") of [RFC 6056](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6056.html). This algorithm is used in Linux for selecting TCP source ports starting from kernel version `5.12-rc1`.

The main idea is that we find hash collisions of the `G()` function when used with loopback TCP connections (`127.0.0.0/8` to `127.0.0.0/8`). These collisions are network independent: they rely only on the key used with `G()`, and as such, the set (or a subset) of `G()` collisions can be used as a device ID, for the lifetime of the key (in Linux, until the device is rebooted).

By sampling TCP source ports originated from the victim device and generated in an attacker-perscribed manner, we can detect the loopback collisions *remotely*. This allows us to track devices via the browser. Since we only care about the source port, a full TCP connection need not be established -- it suffices that the attacker will capture a TCP SYN packet originated from the victim device and then reset the connection.

This prototype contains a tracking server written in Go and a tracking client written in HTML+JavaScript. The Linux kernel issue is tracked as [CVE-2022-32296](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32296).

For full details and analysis of the attack, please refer to our paper "Device Tracking via Linux's New TCP Source Port Selection Algorithm" by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad, to be presented on USENIX Security '23. An extended version of the paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12993.pdf).

## Which Linux kernel versions are affected?

Linux switched from Algorithm 3 of RFC 6056 to Algorithm 4 starting from kernel version `5.12-rc1`, by commit 190cc82489f4 ("tcp: change source port randomizarion [sic] at connect() time").
The issue was [fixed](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220427065233.2075-1-w%401wt.eu/) in versions `5.17.9` (and above) and `5.15.41` (the LTS version that include the vulnerability).

To detect whether your Linux machine is vulnerable, you can use our tester, `CVE-2022-32296_tester.py`, that is available as a Python 3 script. It does not assume root privileges.

## Which browsers can be used for tracking?

We tested our prototype on Google Chrome v96.0.4664.110 and Mozilla Firefox v96.0. Our implementation works best on Chrome. (Please see the paper for details.)

## How long does it take to produce a device ID?

On Chrome, it takes between 5 to 15 seconds, depending on the RTT to the tracking server.

## What are the limitations of this technique?

Our technique relies on sampling TCP source ports originated from the tracked client. Consequently, a NAT device which rewrites TCP source ports causes our attack to fail. Similarly, our technique cannot track clients that connect via forward proxies, which establish a new TCP connection to the tracking server (instead of a direct connection from the client). In particular, Tor clients are not affected.

## How can I protect my system?

It's best that you update your Linux kernel to the patched versions: 5.17.9 (and above) or 5.15.41 (and above) if your system uses the 5.15 LTS branch.

## How can I experiment with this technique?

You can experiment with our prototype with the following steps:

1. Compile the tracker server and run it.

Compile the tracker server with:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y golang-go libpcap-dev

# On the project directory
$ go get github.com/google/gopacket
$ go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap

# Now you can build the tracker
$ go build -o tracker tracker.go

```

Run the tracker server with:

```
sudo ./tracker -iface <capturing-interface>

```

To run the server on your loopback interface, replace `<capturing-interface>` with `lo`.

2. Access the tracker via the browser. (Make sure your OS runs on a vulnerable Linux kernel; You can use our tool `CVE-2022-32296_tester.py` to test that.)

3. Type the tracker IP address on the "Tracker address" field.

4. Hit "Fingerprint me!".

You should see the same fingerprint generated on each run.

Debian Bug     : 922204

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is unfortunately not available for the armel architecture.

CVE-2018-1108

    It was discovered that the random driver could generate random
    bytes through /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before
    gathering enough entropy that these would be unpredictable.  This
    could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted
    communications.

    The original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it
    caused the boot process to hang on many systems.  In this version,
    the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in
    gathering entropy without needing a hardware RNG.

CVE-2021-4149

    Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There
    is a potential lock imbalance in an error path.  A local user
    might be able to exploit this for denial of service.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0494

    The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
    exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO
    capabilities.

CVE-2022-0812

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma)
    miscalculated the size of message headers, which could lead to a
    leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients.

CVE-2022-0854

    Ali Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA
    subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this
    might allow a local user to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1011

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space)
    implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296

    Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness
    in randomisation of TCP source port selection.

CVE-2022-1016

    David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where
    the nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that
    nf_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker
    can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1198

    Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1199

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-1353

    The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY
    subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an
    IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include
    sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1516

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
    set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
    of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1729

    Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
    which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The
    default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more
    permissive settings have been applied in the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2022-1734

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver
    that could lead to a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1974, CVE-2022-1975

    Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was
    suspectible to denial of service.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-21123, CVE-2022-21125, CVE-2022-21166

    Various researchers discovered flaws in Intel x86 processors,
    collectively referred to as MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.
    These are similar to the previously published Microarchitectural
    Data Sampling (MDS) issues and could be exploited by local users
    to leak sensitive information.

    For some CPUs, the mitigations for these issues require updated
    microcode.  An updated intel-microcode package may be provided at
    a later date.  The updated CPU microcode may also be available as
    part of a system firmware ("BIOS") update.

    Further information on the mitigation can be found at
    <<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/processor_mmio_stale_data.html>>
    or in the linux-doc-4.9 package.

CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039,
CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396)

    Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers
    misused the Xen grant table API in a way that could be exploited
    by a malicious device backend to cause data corruption, leaks of
    sensitive information, or a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-23960

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Arm processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-24958

    A flaw was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to configure USB
    gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-26490

    Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver
    can result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-26966

    A flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver. A local
    user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this
    to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-27223

    A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller
    driver. On systems using this driver, a malicious USB host could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-28356

    "Beraphin" discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
    not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
    local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-28390

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
    CAN/USB interface driver.

CVE-2022-30594

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and
    seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still
    permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp
    restrictions.

CVE-2022-32250

    Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-33981

    Yuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in
    the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy
    drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    This ioctl is now disabled by default.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.320-2.

For the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised
implementations of several cryptographic and CRC algorithms.  For at
least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to
a leak of sensitive information.

This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.9.304-4.9.320 inclusive.  The random driver has been backported from
Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and correctness issues.  Some
changes will be visible:

- The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.  You may need
  to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space
  entropy gathering services to allow for this.

- On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more
  uses of /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised.  These uses
  were previously under-counted and this is not a regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

mm/kfence: reset PG\_slab and memcg\_data before freeing \_\_kfence\_pool
commit 2839b0999c20c9f6bf353849c69370e121e2fa1a upstream.
When kfence fails to initialize kfence pool, it frees the pool. But it
does not reset memcg\_data and PG\_slab flag.
Below is a BUG because of this. Let's fix it by resetting memcg\_data
and PG\_slab flag before free.

As shown in the RIP address, this VM\_BUG\_ON in folio\_entire\_mapcount() is
called from dump\_page("hwpoison: unhandlable page") in get\_any\_page().
The below explains the mechanism of the race:
CPU 0 CPU 1
memory\_failure
get\_hwpoison\_page
get\_any\_page
dump\_page
compound = PageCompound
free\_pages\_prepare
page->flags &= ~PAGE\_FLAGS\_CHECK\_AT\_PREP
folio\_entire\_mapcount
VM\_BUG\_ON\_FOLIO(!folio\_test\_large(folio))
So replace dump\_page() with safer one, pr\_err().

dma-buf: call dma\_buf\_stats\_setup after dmabuf is in valid list
commit ef3a6b70507a2add2cd2e01f5eb9b54d561bacb9 upstream.
When dma\_buf\_stats\_setup() fails, it closes the dmabuf file which
results into the calling of dma\_buf\_file\_release() where it does
list\_del(&dmabuf->list\_node) with out first adding it to the proper
list. This is resulting into panic in the below path:
\_\_list\_del\_entry\_valid+0x38/0xac

Fix it by moving the dma\_buf\_stats\_setup() after dmabuf is added to the
list.

Transition to drm\_mode\_fb\_cmd2 from drm\_mode\_fb\_cmd left the structure
unitialized. drm\_mode\_fb\_cmd2 adds a few additional members, e.g. flags
and modifiers which were never initialized. Garbage in those members
can cause random failures during the bringup of the fbcon.
Initializing the structure fixes random blank screens after bootup due
to flags/modifiers mismatches during the fbcon bring up.

The KSZ8061 phy\_driver structure does not have the .probe/..driver\_data

This causes the NULL pointer dereference inside kszphy\_config\_reset().
Fix the problem by using the generic suspend/resume functions as before.
Another alternative would be to provide the .probe and .driver\_data

just restore Ethernet functionality by using the generic suspend/resume.

arm[64]/memremap: don't abuse pfn\_valid() to ensure presence of linear map
commit 260364d112bc822005224667c0c9b1b17a53eafd upstream.
The semantics of pfn\_valid() is to check presence of the memory map for a
PFN and not whether a PFN is covered by the linear map. The memory map
may be present for NOMAP memory regions, but they won't be mapped in the
linear mapping. Accessing such regions via \_\_va() when they are
memremap()'ed will cause a crash.
On v5.4.y the crash happens on qemu-arm with UEFI [1]:

On kernels v5.10.y and newer the same crash won't reproduce on ARM because
commit b10d6bca8720 ("arch, drivers: replace for\_each\_membock() with
for\_each\_mem\_range()") changed the way memory regions are registered in
the resource tree, but that merely covers up the problem.
On ARM64 memory resources registered in yet another way and there the
issue of wrong usage of pfn\_valid() to ensure availability of the linear
map is also covered.
Implement arch\_memremap\_can\_ram\_remap() on ARM and ARM64 to prevent access
to NOMAP regions via the linear mapping in memremap().

ath11k: reduce the wait time of 11d scan and hw scan while add interface
commit bb300130e47fcefbe938f06dbacaef0312e28416 upstream.
(cherry picked from commit 1f682dc9fb3790aa7ec27d3d122ff32b1eda1365 in wireless-next)
Currently ath11k will wait 11d scan complete while add interface in
ath11k\_mac\_op\_add\_interface(), when system resume without enable
wowlan, ath11k\_mac\_op\_add\_interface() is called for each resume, thus
it increase the resume time of system. And ath11k\_mac\_op\_hw\_scan()
after ath11k\_mac\_op\_add\_interface() also needs some time cost because
the previous 11d scan need more than 5 seconds when 6 GHz is enabled,
then the scan started event will indicated to ath11k after the 11d
scan completed.
While 11d scan/hw scan is running in firmware, if ath11k update channel
list to firmware by WMI\_SCAN\_CHAN\_LIST\_CMDID, then firmware will cancel
the current scan which is running, it lead the scan failed. The patch
commit 9dcf6808b253 ("ath11k: add 11d scan offload support") used
finish\_11d\_scan/finish\_11d\_ch\_list/pending\_11d to synchronize the 11d
scan/hw scan/channel list between ath11k/firmware/mac80211 and to avoid
the scan fail.
Add wait operation before ath11k update channel list, function
ath11k\_reg\_update\_chan\_list() will wait until the current 11d scan/hw
scan completed. And remove the wait operation of start 11d scan and
waiting channel list complete in hw scan. After these changes, resume
time cost reduce about 5 seconds and also hw scan time cost reduced
obviously, and scan failed not seen.
The 11d scan is sent to firmware only one time for each interface added
in mac.c, and it is moved after the 1st hw scan because 11d scan will
cost some time and thus leads the AP scan result update to UI delay.
Currently priority of ath11k's hw scan is WMI\_SCAN\_PRIORITY\_LOW, and
priority of 11d scan in firmware is WMI\_SCAN\_PRIORITY\_MEDIUM, then the
11d scan which sent after hw scan will cancel the hw scan in firmware,
so change the priority to WMI\_SCAN\_PRIORITY\_MEDIUM for the hw scan which
is in front of the 11d scan, thus it will not happen scan cancel in
firmware.

ping: fix address binding wrt vrf
commit e1a7ac6f3ba6e157adcd0ca94d92a401f1943f56 upstream.
When ping\_group\_range is updated, 'ping' uses the DGRAM ICMP socket,
instead of an IP raw socket. In this case, 'ping' is unable to bind its
socket to a local address owned by a vrflite.
Before the patch:
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping\_group\_range='0 2147483647'
$ ip link add blue type vrf table 10
$ ip link add foo type dummy
$ ip link set foo master blue
$ ip link set foo up
$ ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev foo
$ ip addr add 2001::1/64 dev foo
$ ip vrf exec blue ping -c1 -I 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
ping: bind: Cannot assign requested address

cgroup/cpuset: Remove cpus\_allowed/mems\_allowed setup in cpuset\_init\_smp()
commit 2685027fca387b602ae565bff17895188b803988 upstream.
There are 3 places where the cpu and node masks of the top cpuset can
be initialized in the order they are executed:
1) start\_kernel -> cpuset\_init()
2) start\_kernel -> cgroup\_init() -> cpuset\_bind()
3) kernel\_init\_freeable() -> do\_basic\_setup() -> cpuset\_init\_smp()
The first cpuset\_init() call just sets all the bits in the masks.
The second cpuset\_bind() call sets cpus\_allowed and mems\_allowed to the
default v2 values. The third cpuset\_init\_smp() call sets them back to
v1 values.
For systems with cgroup v2 setup, cpuset\_bind() is called once. As a
result, cpu and memory node hot add may fail to update the cpu and node
masks of the top cpuset to include the newly added cpu or node in a
cgroup v2 environment.
For systems with cgroup v1 setup, cpuset\_bind() is called again by
rebind\_subsystem() when the v1 cpuset filesystem is mounted as shown
in the dmesg log below with an instrumented kernel.
[ 2.609781] cpuset\_bind() called - v2 = 1
[ 3.079473] cpuset\_init\_smp() called
[ 7.103710] cpuset\_bind() called - v2 = 0
smp\_init() is called after the first two init functions. So we don't
have a complete list of active cpus and memory nodes until later in
cpuset\_init\_smp() which is the right time to set up effective\_cpus
and effective\_mems.
To fix this cgroup v2 mask setup problem, the potentially incorrect
cpus\_allowed & mems\_allowed setting in cpuset\_init\_smp() are removed.
For cgroup v2 systems, the initial cpuset\_bind() call will set the masks
correctly. For cgroup v1 systems, the second call to cpuset\_bind()
will do the right setup.

writeback: Avoid skipping inode writeback
commit 846a3351ddfe4a86eede4bb26a205c3f38ef84d3 upstream.
We have run into an issue that a task gets stuck in
balance\_dirty\_pages\_ratelimited() when perform I/O stress testing.
The reason we observed is that an I\_DIRTY\_PAGES inode with lots
of dirty pages is in b\_dirty\_time list and standard background
writeback cannot writeback the inode.
After studing the relevant code, the following scenario may lead
to the issue:
task1 task2
----- -----
fuse\_flush
write\_inode\_now //in b\_dirty\_time
writeback\_single\_inode
\_\_writeback\_single\_inode
fuse\_write\_end
filemap\_dirty\_folio
\_\_xa\_set\_mark:PAGECACHE\_TAG\_DIRTY
lock inode->i\_lock
if mapping tagged PAGECACHE\_TAG\_DIRTY
inode->i\_state |= I\_DIRTY\_PAGES
unlock inode->i\_lock
\_\_mark\_inode\_dirty:I\_DIRTY\_PAGES
lock inode->i\_lock
-was dirty,inode stays in
-b\_dirty\_time
unlock inode->i\_lock
if(!(inode->i\_state & I\_DIRTY\_All))
-not true,so nothing done
This patch moves the dirty inode to b\_dirty list when the inode
currently is not queued in b\_io or b\_more\_io list at the end of
writeback\_single\_inode.

With the FEC driver phydev->adjust\_link() calls fec\_enet\_adjust\_link()
calls fec\_stop()/fec\_restart() and both these function reset and
temporary disable the FEC disrupting any MII transaction that
could be happening at the same time.
fec\_enet\_adjust\_link() and phy\_read() can be running at the same time
when we have one additional interrupt before the phy\_state\_machine() is
able to terminate.

net: atlantic: always deep reset on pm op, fixing up my null deref regression
commit 1809c30b6e5a83a1de1435fe01aaa4de4d626a7c upstream.
The impact of this regression is the same for resume that I saw on
thaw: the kernel hangs and nothing except SysRq rebooting can be done.
Fixes regression in commit cbe6c3a8f8f4 ("net: atlantic: invert deep
par in pm functions, preventing null derefs"), where I disabled deep
pm resets in suspend and resume, trying to make sense of the
atl\_resume\_common() deep parameter in the first place.
It turns out, that atlantic always has to deep reset on pm
operations. Even though I expected that and tested resume, I screwed
up by kexec-rebooting into an unpatched kernel, thus missing the
breakage.
This fixup obsoletes the deep parameter of atl\_resume\_common, but I
leave the cleanup for the maintainers to post to mainline.
Suspend and hibernation were successfully tested by the reporters.

i40e: i40e\_main: fix a missing check on list iterator
commit 3f95a7472d14abef284d8968734fe2ae7ff4845f upstream.
The bug is here:
ret = i40e\_add\_macvlan\_filter(hw, ch->seid, vdev->dev\_addr, &aq\_err);
The list iterator 'ch' will point to a bogus position containing
HEAD if the list is empty or no element is found. This case must
be checked before any use of the iterator, otherwise it will
lead to a invalid memory access.
To fix this bug, use a new variable 'iter' as the list iterator,
while use the origin variable 'ch' as a dedicated pointer to
point to the found element.

drm/vmwgfx: Disable command buffers on svga3 without gbobjects
commit 21d1d192890ced87f2f04f8f4dea92406e0b162a upstream.
With very limited vram on svga3 it's difficult to handle all the surface
migrations. Without gbobjects, i.e. the ability to store surfaces in
guest mobs, there's no reason to support intermediate svga2 features,
especially because we can fall back to fb traces and svga3 will never
support those in-between features.
On svga3 we wither want to use fb traces or screen targets
(i.e. gbobjects), nothing in between. This fixes presentation on a lot
of fusion/esxi tech previews where the exposed svga3 caps haven't been
finalized yet.

mm: mremap: fix sign for EFAULT error return value
commit 7d1e6496616275f3830e2f2f91fa69a66953e95b upstream.
The mremap syscall is supposed to return a pointer to the new virtual
memory area on success, and a negative value of the error code in case of
failure. Currently, EFAULT is returned when the VMA is not found, instead
of -EFAULT. The users of this syscall will therefore believe the syscall
succeeded in case the VMA didn't exist, as it returns a pointer to address
0xe (0xe being the value of EFAULT). Fix the sign of the error value.

We think that raising BUG is overkilling for splitting huge\_zero\_page, the
huge\_zero\_page can't be met from normal paths other than memory failure,
but memory failure is a valid caller. So we tend to replace the BUG to
WARN + returning -EBUSY, and thus the panic above won't happen again.

commit 86079983c0f255e78649b41885762d2907801274

Revert "mm/memory-failure.c: skip huge\_zero\_page in memory\_failure()"
commit b4e61fc031b11dd807dffc46cebbf0e25966d3d1 upstream.
Patch series "mm/memory-failure: rework fix on huge\_zero\_page splitting".
This patch (of 2):
This reverts commit d173d5417fb67411e623d394aab986d847e47dad.
The commit d173d5417fb6 ("mm/memory-failure.c: skip huge\_zero\_page in
memory\_failure()") explicitly skips huge\_zero\_page in memory\_failure(), in
order to avoid triggering VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE on huge\_zero\_page in
split\_huge\_page\_to\_list().
This works, but Yang Shi thinks that,
Raising BUG is overkilling for splitting huge\_zero\_page. The
huge\_zero\_page can't be met from normal paths other than memory
failure, but memory failure is a valid caller. So I tend to replace
the BUG to WARN + returning -EBUSY. If we don't care about the
reason code in memory failure, we don't have to touch memory
failure.
And for the issue that huge\_zero\_page will be set PG\_has\_hwpoisoned,
Yang Shi comments that,
The anonymous page fault doesn't check if the page is poisoned or
not since it typically gets a fresh allocated page and assumes the
poisoned page (isolated successfully) can't be reallocated again.
But huge zero page and base zero page are reused every time. So no
matter what fix we pick, the issue is always there.
Finally, Yang, David, Anshuman and Naoya all agree to fix the bug, i.e.,
to split huge\_zero\_page, in split\_huge\_page\_to\_list().
This reverts the commit d173d5417fb6 ("mm/memory-failure.c: skip
huge\_zero\_page in memory\_failure()"), and the original bug will be fixed
by the next patch.

ceph: fix setting of xattrs on async created inodes
commit 620239d9a32e9fe27c9204ec11e40058671aeeb6 upstream.
Currently when we create a file, we spin up an xattr buffer to send
along with the create request. If we end up doing an async create
however, then we currently pass down a zero-length xattr buffer.
Fix the code to send down the xattr buffer in req->r\_pagelist. If the
xattrs span more than a page, however give up and don't try to do an
async create.

serial: 8250\_mtk: Fix UART\_EFR register address
commit bb0b197aadd928f52ce6f01f0ee977f0a08cf1be upstream.
On MediaTek SoCs, the UART IP is 16550A compatible, but there are some
specific quirks: we are declaring a register shift of 2, but this is
only valid for the majority of the registers, as there are some that
are out of the standard layout.
Specifically, this driver is using definitions from serial\_reg.h, where
we have a UART\_EFR register defined as 2: this results in a 0x8 offset,
but there we have the FCR register instead.
The right offset for the EFR register on MediaTek UART is at 0x98,
so, following the decimal definition convention in serial\_reg.h and
accounting for the register left shift of two, add and use the correct
register address for this IP, defined as decimal 38, so that the final
calculation results in (0x26 << 2) = 0x98.

genirq: Remove WARN\_ON\_ONCE() in generic\_handle\_domain\_irq()
commit 792ea6a074ae7ea5ab6f1b8b31f76bb0297de66c upstream.
Since commit 0953fb263714 ("irq: remove handle\_domain\_{irq,nmi}()"),
generic\_handle\_domain\_irq() warns if called outside hardirq context, even
though the function calls down to handle\_irq\_desc(), which warns about the
same, but conditionally on handle\_enforce\_irqctx().
The newly added warning is a false positive if the interrupt originates
from any other irqchip than x86 APIC or ARM GIC/GICv3. Those are the only
ones for which handle\_enforce\_irqctx() returns true. Per commit
c16816acd086 ("genirq: Add protection against unsafe usage of
generic\_handle\_irq()"):
"In general calling generic\_handle\_irq() with interrupts disabled from non
interrupt context is harmless. For some interrupt controllers like the
x86 trainwrecks this is outright dangerous as it might corrupt state if
an interrupt affinity change is pending."
Examples for interrupt chips where the warning is a false positive are
USB-attached GPIO controllers such as drivers/gpio/gpio-dln2.c:
USB gadgets are incapable of directly signaling an interrupt because they
cannot initiate a bus transaction by themselves. All communication on
the bus is initiated by the host controller, which polls a gadget's
Interrupt Endpoint in regular intervals. If an interrupt is pending,
that information is passed up the stack in softirq context, from which a
hardirq is synthesized via generic\_handle\_domain\_irq().
Remove the warning to eliminate such false positives.

usb: typec: tcpci: Don't skip cleanup in .remove() on error
commit bbc126ae381cf0a27822c1f822d0aeed74cc40d9 upstream.
Returning an error value in an i2c remove callback results in an error
message being emitted by the i2c core, but otherwise it doesn't make a
difference. The device goes away anyhow and the devm cleanups are
called.
In this case the remove callback even returns early without stopping the
tcpm worker thread and various timers. A work scheduled on the work
queue, or a firing timer after tcpci\_remove() returned probably results
in a use-after-free situation because the regmap and driver data were
freed. So better make sure that tcpci\_unregister\_port() is called even
if disabling the irq failed.
Also emit a more specific error message instead of the i2c core's
"remove failed (EIO), will be ignored" and return 0 to suppress the
core's warning.
This patch is (also) a preparation for making i2c remove callbacks
return void.

usb: cdc-wdm: fix reading stuck on device close
commit 01e01f5c89773c600a9f0b32c888de0146066c3a upstream.
cdc-wdm tracks whether a response reading request is in-progress and
blocks the next request from being sent until the previous request is
completed. As soon as last user closes the cdc-wdm device file, the
driver cancels any ongoing requests, resets the pending response
counter, but leaves the response reading in-progress flag
(WDM\_RESPONDING) untouched.
So if the user closes the device file during the response receive
request is being performed, no more data will be obtained from the
modem. The request will be cancelled, effectively preventing the
WDM\_RESPONDING flag from being reseted. Keeping the flag set will
prevent a new response receive request from being sent, permanently
blocking the read path. The read path will staying blocked until the
module will be reloaded or till the modem will be re-attached.
This stuck has been observed with a Huawei E3372 modem attached to an
OpenWrt router and using the comgt utility to set up a network
connection.
Fix this issue by clearing the WDM\_RESPONDING flag on the device file
close.
Without this fix, the device reading stuck can be easily reproduced in a
few connection establishing attempts. With this fix, a load test for
modem connection re-establishing worked for several hours without any
issues.

usb: gadget: uvc: allow for application to cleanly shutdown
commit b81ac4395bbeaf36e078dea1a48c02dd97b76235 upstream.
Several types of kernel panics can occur due to timing during the uvc
gadget removal. This appears to be a problem with gadget resources being
managed by both the client application's v4l2 open/close and the UDC
gadget bind/unbind. Since the concept of USB\_GADGET\_DELAYED\_STATUS
doesn't exist for unbind, add a wait to allow for the application to
close out.
Some examples of the panics that can occur are:

tty: n\_gsm: fix invalid gsmtty\_write\_room() result
commit 9361ebfbb79fd1bc8594a487c01ad52cdaa391ea upstream.
gsmtty\_write() does not prevent the user to use the full fifo size of 4096
bytes as allocated in gsm\_dlci\_alloc(). However, gsmtty\_write\_room() tries
to limit the return value by 'TX\_SIZE' and returns a negative value if the
fifo has more than 'TX\_SIZE' bytes stored. This is obviously wrong as
'TX\_SIZE' is defined as 512.
Define 'TX\_SIZE' to the fifo size and use it accordingly for allocation to
keep the current behavior. Return the correct remaining size of the fifo in
gsmtty\_write\_room() via kfifo\_avail().

tty: n\_gsm: fix mux activation issues in gsm\_config()
commit edd5f60c340086891fab094ad61270d6c80f9ca4 upstream.
The current implementation activates the mux if it was restarted and opens
the control channel if the mux was previously closed and we are now acting
as initiator instead of responder, which is the default setting.
This has two issues.
1) No mux is activated if we keep all default values and only switch to
initiator. The control channel is not allocated but will be opened next
which results in a NULL pointer dereference.
2) Switching the configuration after it was once configured while keeping
the initiator value the same will not reopen the control channel if it was
closed due to parameter incompatibilities. The mux remains dead.
Fix 1) by always activating the mux if it is dead after configuration.
Fix 2) by always opening the control channel after mux activation.

tty: n\_gsm: fix buffer over-read in gsm\_dlci\_data()
commit fd442e5ba30aaa75ea47b32149e7a3110dc20a46 upstream.
'len' is decreased after each octet that has its EA bit set to 0, which
means that the value is encoded with additional octets. However, the final
octet does not decreases 'len' which results in 'len' being one byte too
long. A buffer over-read may occur in tty\_insert\_flip\_string() as it tries
to read one byte more than the passed content size of 'data'.
Decrease 'len' also for the final octet which has the EA bit set to 1 to
write the correct number of bytes from the internal receive buffer to the
virtual tty.

KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Enable MSR\_DR for switch\_mmu\_context()
commit ee8348496c77e3737d0a6cda307a521f2cff954f upstream.
Commit 863771a28e27 ("powerpc/32s: Convert switch\_mmu\_context() to C")
moved the switch\_mmu\_context() to C. While in principle a good idea, it
meant that the function now uses the stack. The stack is not accessible
from real mode though.
So to keep calling the function, let's turn on MSR\_DR while we call it.
That way, all pointer references to the stack are handled virtually.
In addition, make sure to save/restore r12 on the stack, as it may get
clobbered by the C function.

firmware\_loader: use kernel credentials when reading firmware
commit 581dd69830341d299b0c097fc366097ab497d679 upstream.
Device drivers may decide to not load firmware when probed to avoid
slowing down the boot process should the firmware filesystem not be
available yet. In this case, the firmware loading request may be done
when a device file associated with the driver is first accessed. The
credentials of the userspace process accessing the device file may be
used to validate access to the firmware files requested by the driver.
Ensure that the kernel assumes the responsibility of reading the
firmware.
This was observed on Android for a graphic driver loading their firmware
when the device file (e.g. /dev/mali0) was first opened by userspace
(i.e. surfaceflinger). The security context of surfaceflinger was used
to validate the access to the firmware file (e.g.
/vendor/firmware/mali.bin).
Previously, Android configurations were not setting up the
firmware\_class.path command line argument and were relying on the
userspace fallback mechanism. In this case, the security context of the
userspace daemon (i.e. ueventd) was consistently used to read firmware
files. More Android devices are now found to set firmware\_class.path
which gives the kernel the opportunity to read the firmware directly
(via kernel\_read\_file\_from\_path\_initns). In this scenario, the current
process credentials were used, even if unrelated to the loading of the
firmware file.

perf tests: Fix coresight `perf test` failure.
[ Upstream commit 45fa7c38696bae632310c2876ba81fdfa25cc9c2 ]
Currently the `perf test` always fails the coresight test like:
89: Check Arm CoreSight trace data recording and synthesized samples: FAILED!
That is because the test\_arm\_coresight.sh is attempting to SIGINT the
parent but is using $$ rather than $PPID and it sigint's itself when
run under the perf test framework.
Since this is done in a trap clause it ends up returning a non zero
return.
Since $PPID is a bash ism and not all distros are linking /bin/sh to
bash, the alternative parent pid lookups are uglier than just dropping
the kill, and its not strictly needed, lets pick the simple solution and
drop the sigint.

interconnect: Restore sync state by ignoring ipa-virt in provider count
[ Upstream commit 20ce30fb4750f2ffc130cdcb26232b1dd87cd0a5 ]

Otherwise all the interconnects in the system will stay pegged at max
speeds because 'providers\_count' is always going to be one larger than
the number of drivers that will ever probe on sc7180 or sdx55. This
fixes suspend on sc7180 and sdx55 devices when you don't have a
devicetree patch to remove the ipa-virt compatible node.

block: Do not call folio\_next() on an unreferenced folio
[ Upstream commit 170f37d6aa6ad4582eefd7459015de79e244536e ]
It is unsafe to call folio\_next() on a folio unless you hold a reference
on it that prevents it from being split or freed. After returning
from the iterator, iomap calls folio\_end\_writeback() which may drop
the last reference to the page, or allow the page to be split. If that
happens, the iterator will not advance far enough through the bio\_vec,
leading to assertion failures like the BUG() in folio\_end\_writeback()
that checks we're not trying to end writeback on a page not currently
under writeback. Other assertion failures were also seen, but they're
all explained by this one bug.
Fix the bug by remembering where the next folio starts before returning
from the iterator. There are other ways of fixing this bug, but this
seems the simplest.

tcp: increase source port perturb table to 2^16
[ Upstream commit 4c2c8f03a5ab7cb04ec64724d7d176d00bcc91e5 ]
Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad reported being able to accurately
identify a client by forcing it to emit only 40 times more connections
than there are entries in the table\_perturb[] table. The previous two
improvements consisting in resalting the secret every 10s and adding
randomness to each port selection only slightly improved the situation,
and the current value of 2^8 was too small as it's not very difficult
to make a client emit 10k connections in less than 10 seconds.
Thus we're increasing the perturb table from 2^8 to 2^16 so that the
same precision now requires 2.6M connections, which is more difficult in
this time frame and harder to hide as a background activity. The impact
is that the table now uses 256 kB instead of 1 kB, which could mostly
affect devices making frequent outgoing connections. However such
components usually target a small set of destinations (load balancers,
database clients, perf assessment tools), and in practice only a few
entries will be visited, like before.
A live test at 1 million connections per second showed no performance
difference from the previous value.

tcp: add small random increments to the source port

Here we're randomly adding between 0 and 7 random increments to the

selection that will make the next port less predictable.
With the default port range of 32768-60999 this means a worst case
reuse scenario of 14116/8=1764 connections between two consecutive
uses of the same port, with an average of 14116/4.5=3137. This code
was stressed at more than 800000 connections per second to a fixed
target with all connections closed by the client using RSTs (worst
condition) and only 2 connections failed among 13 billion, despite
the hash being reseeded every 10 seconds, indicating a perfectly
safe situation.

s390: disable -Warray-bounds
[ Upstream commit 8b202ee218395319aec1ef44f72043e1fbaccdd6 ]
gcc-12 shows a lot of array bound warnings on s390. This is caused
by the S390\_lowcore macro which uses a hardcoded address of 0.
Wrapping that with absolute\_pointer() works, but gcc no longer knows
that a 12 bit displacement is sufficient to access lowcore. So it
emits instructions like 'lghi %r1,0; l %rx,xxx(%r1)' instead of a
single load/store instruction. As s390 stores variables often
read/written in lowcore, this is considered problematic. Therefore
disable -Warray-bounds on s390 for gcc-12 for the time being, until
there is a better solution.

Tegra194 and Tegra234 SoCs have the erratum that causes walk cache
entries to not be invalidated correctly. The problem is that the walk
cache index generated for IOVA is not same across translation and
invalidation requests. This is leading to page faults when PMD entry is
released during unmap and populated with new PTE table during subsequent
map request. Disabling large page mappings avoids the release of PMD
entry and avoid translations seeing stale PMD entry in walk cache.

Tegra234 devices. This is recommended fix from Tegra hardware design
team.

irdma\_cleanup\_cm\_core(), because the del\_timer\_sync() function will just
return directly if there isn't a pending timer. As a result, the lock is
redundant, because there is no resource it could protect.

gfs2: Fix filesystem block deallocation for short writes

When a write cannot be carried out in full, gfs2\_iomap\_end() releases
blocks that have been allocated for this write but haven't been used.
To compute the end of the allocation, gfs2\_iomap\_end() incorrectly
rounded the end of the attempted write down to the next block boundary
to arrive at the end of the allocation. It would have to round up, but
the end of the allocation is also available as iomap->offset +
iomap->length, so just use that instead.
In addition, use round\_up() for computing the start of the unused range.

drm/vmwgfx: Fix fencing on SVGAv3
[ Upstream commit 1d6595b4cd47acfd824550f48f10b54a6f0e93ee ]
Port of the vmwgfx to SVGAv3 lacked support for fencing. SVGAv3 removed
FIFO's and replaced them with command buffers and extra registers.
The initial version of SVGAv3 lacked support for most advanced features
(e.g. 3D) which made fences unnecessary. That is no longer the case,
especially as 3D support is being turned on.
Switch from FIFO commands and capabilities to command buffers and extra
registers to enable fences on SVGAv3.

tls: Fix context leak on tls\_device\_down
[ Upstream commit 3740651bf7e200109dd42d5b2fb22226b26f960a ]
The commit cited below claims to fix a use-after-free condition after
tls\_device\_down. Apparently, the description wasn't fully accurate. The
context stayed alive, but ctx->netdev became NULL, and the offload was
torn down without a proper fallback, so a bug was present, but a
different kind of bug.
Due to misunderstanding of the issue, the original patch dropped the
refcount\_dec\_and\_test line for the context to avoid the alleged
premature deallocation. That line has to be restored, because it matches
the refcount\_inc\_not\_zero from the same function, otherwise the contexts
that survived tls\_device\_down are leaked.
This patch fixes the described issue by restoring refcount\_dec\_and\_test.
After this change, there is no leak anymore, and the fallback to
software kTLS still works.

[ Upstream commit 1fa89ffbc04545b7582518e57f4b63e2a062870f ]
In the NIC ->probe() callback, ->mtd\_probe() callback is called.
If NIC has 2 ports, ->probe() is called twice and ->mtd\_probe() too.
In the ->mtd\_probe(), which is efx\_ef10\_mtd\_probe() it allocates and
initializes mtd partiion.
But mtd partition for sfc is shared data.
So that allocated mtd partition data from last called
efx\_ef10\_mtd\_probe() will not be used.
Therefore it must be freed.
But it doesn't free a not used mtd partition data in efx\_ef10\_mtd\_probe().

mlxsw: Avoid warning during ip6gre device removal
[ Upstream commit 810c2f0a3f86158c1e02e74947b66d811473434a ]
IPv6 addresses which are used for tunnels are stored in a hash table
with reference counting. When a new GRE tunnel is configured, the driver
is notified and configures it in hardware.
Currently, any change in the tunnel is not applied in the driver. It
means that if the remote address is changed, the driver is not aware of
this change and the first address will be used.
This behavior results in a warning [1] in scenarios such as the
following:
# ip link add name gre1 type ip6gre local 2000::3 remote 2000::fffe tos inherit ttl inherit
# ip link set name gre1 type ip6gre local 2000::3 remote 2000::ffff ttl inherit
# ip link delete gre1
The change of the address is not applied in the driver. Currently, the
driver uses the remote address which is stored in the 'parms' of the
overlay device. When the tunnel is removed, the new IPv6 address is
used, the driver tries to release it, but as it is not aware of the
change, this address is not configured and it warns about releasing non
existing IPv6 address.
Fix it by using the IPv6 address which is cached in the IPIP entry, this
address is the last one that the driver used, so even in cases such the
above, the first address will be released, without any warning.

net/sched: act\_pedit: really ensure the skb is writable
[ Upstream commit 8b796475fd7882663a870456466a4fb315cc1bd6 ]
Currently pedit tries to ensure that the accessed skb offset
is writable via skb\_unclone(). The action potentially allows
touching any skb bytes, so it may end-up modifying shared data.
The above causes some sporadic MPTCP self-test failures, due to
this code:
tc -n $ns2 filter add dev ns2eth$i egress \
protocol ip prio 1000 \
handle 42 fw \
action pedit munge offset 148 u8 invert \
pipe csum tcp \
index 100
The above modifies a data byte outside the skb head and the skb is
a cloned one, carrying a TCP output packet.
This change addresses the issue by keeping track of a rough
over-estimate highest skb offset accessed by the action and ensuring
such offset is really writable.
Note that this may cause performance regressions in some scenarios,
but hopefully pedit is not in the critical path.

dsa\_port\_switchdev\_sync\_attrs() call right below it.
When switchdev\_bridge\_port\_offload() finishes, FDB entries have been
replayed by the bridge, but are scheduled for deferred execution later.
However dsa\_port\_switchdev\_sync\_attrs -> dsa\_port\_can\_apply\_vlan\_filtering()
may impose restrictions on the vlan\_filtering attribute and refuse
offloading.
When this happens, the delayed FDB entries will dereference dp->bridge,
which is a NULL pointer because we have stopped the process of
offloading this bridge.

Error: dsa\_core: Must first remove VLAN uppers having VIDs also present in bridge.
Fix the bug by doing what we do on the normal bridge leave path as well,
which is to wait until the deferred FDB entries complete executing, then
exit.
The placement of dsa\_flush\_workqueue() after switchdev\_bridge\_port\_unoffload()
guarantees that both the FDB additions and deletions on rollback are waited for.

selftests: vm: Makefile: rename TARGETS to VMTARGETS
[ Upstream commit 41c240099fe09377b6b9f8272e45d2267c843d3e ]
The tools/testing/selftests/vm/Makefile uses the variable TARGETS
internally to generate a list of platform-specific binary build targets
suffixed with \_{32,64}. When building the selftests using its own
Makefile directly, such as via the following command run in a kernel tree:
One receives an error such as the following:
make: Entering directory '/root/linux/tools/testing/selftests'
make --no-builtin-rules ARCH=x86 -C ../../.. headers\_install
make[1]: Entering directory '/root/linux'

make: Leaving directory '/root/linux/tools/testing/selftests'
The TARGETS variable passed to tools/testing/selftests/Makefile collides
with the TARGETS used in tools/testing/selftests/vm/Makefile, so rename
the latter to VMTARGETS, eliminating the collision with no functional
change.

dim: initialize all struct fields
[ Upstream commit ee1444b5e1df4155b591d0d9b1e72853a99ea861 ]
The W=2 build pointed out that the code wasn't initializing all the
variables in the dim\_cq\_moder declarations with the struct initializers.
The net change here is zero since these structs were already static
const globals and were initialized with zeros by the compiler, but
removing compiler warnings has value in and of itself.
lib/dim/net\_dim.c: At top level:
lib/dim/net\_dim.c:54:9: warning: missing initializer for field ‘comps’ of ‘const struct dim\_cq\_moder’ [-Wmissing-field-initializers]
54 | NET\_DIM\_RX\_EQE\_PROFILES,
| ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from lib/dim/net\_dim.c:6:
./include/linux/dim.h:45:13: note: ‘comps’ declared here
45 | u16 comps;
| ^~~~~
and repeats for the tx struct, and once you fix the comps entry then
the cq\_period\_mode field needs the same treatment.
Use the commonly accepted style to indicate to the compiler that we
know what we're doing, and add a comma at the end of each struct
initializer to clean up the issue, and use explicit initializers
for the fields we are initializing which makes the compiler happy.
While here and fixing these lines, clean up the code slightly with
a fix for the super long lines by removing the word "\_MODERATION" from a
couple defines only used in this file.

fanotify: do not allow setting dirent events in mask of non-dir
[ Upstream commit ceaf69f8eadcafb323392be88e7a5248c415d423 ]
Dirent events (create/delete/move) are only reported on watched
directory inodes, but in fanotify as well as in legacy inotify, it was
always allowed to set them on non-dir inode, which does not result in
any meaningful outcome.
Until kernel v5.17, dirent events in fanotify also differed from events
"on child" (e.g. FAN\_OPEN) in the information provided in the event.
For example, FAN\_OPEN could be set in the mask of a non-dir or the mask
of its parent and event would report the fid of the child regardless of
the marked object.
By contrast, FAN\_DELETE is not reported if the child is marked and the
child fid was not reported in the events.
Since kernel v5.17, with fanotify group flag FAN\_REPORT\_TARGET\_FID, the
fid of the child is reported with dirent events, like events "on child",
which may create confusion for users expecting the same behavior as
events "on child" when setting events in the mask on a child.
The desired semantics of setting dirent events in the mask of a child
are not clear, so for now, deny this action for a group initialized
with flag FAN\_REPORT\_TARGET\_FID and for the new event FAN\_RENAME.
We may relax this restriction in the future if we decide on the
semantics and implement them.

net: sfc: fix memory leak due to ptp channel
[ Upstream commit 49e6123c65dac6393b04f39ceabf79c44f66b8be ]
It fixes memory leak in ring buffer change logic.
When ring buffer size is changed(ethtool -G eth0 rx 4096), sfc driver
works like below.
1. stop all channels and remove ring buffers.
2. allocates new buffer array.
3. allocates rx buffers.
4. start channels.
While the above steps are working, it skips some steps if the channel
doesn't have a ->copy callback function.
Due to ptp channel doesn't have ->copy callback, these above steps are
skipped for ptp channel.
It eventually makes some problems.
a. ptp channel's ring buffer size is not changed, it works only
1024(default).
b. memory leak.
The reason for memory leak is to use the wrong ring buffer values.
There are some values, which is related to ring buffer size.
a. efx->rxq\_entries
- This is global value of rx queue size.
b. rx\_queue->ptr\_mask
- used for access ring buffer as circular ring.
- roundup\_pow\_of\_two(efx->rxq\_entries) - 1
c. rx\_queue->max\_fill
- efx->rxq\_entries - EFX\_RXD\_HEAD\_ROOM
These all values should be based on ring buffer size consistently.
But ptp channel's values are not.
a. efx->rxq\_entries
- This is global(for sfc) value, always new ring buffer size.
b. rx\_queue->ptr\_mask
- This is always 1023(default).
c. rx\_queue->max\_fill
- This is new ring buffer size - EFX\_RXD\_HEAD\_ROOM.
Let's assume we set 4096 for rx ring buffer,
normal channel ptp channel
efx->rxq\_entries 4096 4096
rx\_queue->ptr\_mask 4095 1023
rx\_queue->max\_fill 4086 4086
sfc driver allocates rx ring buffers based on these values.
When it allocates ptp channel's ring buffer, 4086 ring buffers are
allocated then, these buffers are attached to the allocated array.
But ptp channel's ring buffer array size is still 1024(default)
and ptr\_mask is still 1023 too.
So, 3062 ring buffers will be overwritten to the array.
This is the reason for memory leak.
Test commands:
ethtool -G  rx 4096
while :
do
ip link set  up
ip link set  down
done
In order to avoid this problem, it adds ->copy callback to ptp channel
type.
So that rx\_queue->ptr\_mask value will be updated correctly.

fb\_info was still used after the free.
This should fix for good by freeing the fb\_info at the end of the handler.

drm/nouveau: Fix a potential theorical leak in nouveau\_get\_backlight\_name()
[ Upstream commit ab244be47a8f111bc82496a8a20c907236e37f95 ]
If successful ida\_simple\_get() calls are not undone when needed, some
additional memory may be allocated and wasted.
Here, an ID between 0 and MAX\_INT is required. If this ID is >=100, it is
not taken into account and is wasted. It should be released.
Instead of calling ida\_simple\_remove(), take advantage of the 'max'
parameter to require the ID not to be too big. Should it be too big, it
is not allocated and don't need to be freed.
While at it, use ida\_alloc\_xxx()/ida\_free() instead to
ida\_simple\_get()/ida\_simple\_remove().
The latter is deprecated and more verbose.

ice: fix PTP stale Tx timestamps cleanup

Read stale PTP Tx timestamps from PHY on cleanup.
After running out of Tx timestamps request handlers, hardware (HW) stops
reporting finished requests. Function ice\_ptp\_tx\_tstamp\_cleanup() used
to only clean up stale handlers in driver and was leaving the hardware
registers not read. Not reading stale PTP Tx timestamps prevents next
interrupts from arriving and makes timestamping unusable.

ice: clear stale Tx queue settings before configuring
[ Upstream commit 6096dae926a22e2892ef9169f582589c16d39639 ]
The iAVF driver uses 3 virtchnl op codes to communicate with the PF
regarding the VF Tx queues:
\* VIRTCHNL\_OP\_CONFIG\_VSI\_QUEUES configures the hardware and firmware
logic for the Tx queues
\* VIRTCHNL\_OP\_ENABLE\_QUEUES configures the queue interrupts
\* VIRTCHNL\_OP\_DISABLE\_QUEUES disables the queue interrupts and Tx rings.
There is a bug in the iAVF driver due to the race condition between VF
reset request and shutdown being executed in parallel. This leads to a
break in logic and VIRTCHNL\_OP\_DISABLE\_QUEUES is not being sent.
If this occurs, the PF driver never cleans up the Tx queues. This results
in leaving behind stale Tx queue settings in the hardware and firmware.
The most obvious outcome is that upon the next
VIRTCHNL\_OP\_CONFIG\_VSI\_QUEUES, the PF will fail to program the Tx
scheduler node due to a lack of space.
We need to protect ICE driver against such situation.
To fix this, make sure we clear existing stale settings out when
handling VIRTCHNL\_OP\_CONFIG\_VSI\_QUEUES. This ensures we remove the
previous settings.
Calling ice\_vf\_vsi\_dis\_single\_txq should be safe as it will do nothing if
the queue is not configured. The function already handles the case when the
Tx queue is not currently configured and exits with a 0 return in that
case.

ice: Fix race during aux device (un)plugging
[ Upstream commit 486b9eee57ddca5c9a2d59fc41153f36002e0a00 ]
Function ice\_plug\_aux\_dev() assigns pf->adev field too early prior
aux device initialization and on other side ice\_unplug\_aux\_dev()
starts aux device deinit and at the end assigns NULL to pf->adev.
This is wrong because pf->adev should always be non-NULL only when
aux device is fully initialized and ready. This wrong order causes
a crash when ice\_send\_event\_to\_aux() call occurs because that function
depends on non-NULL value of pf->adev and does not assume that
aux device is half-initialized or half-destroyed.
After order correction the race window is tiny but it is still there,
as Leon mentioned and manipulation with pf->adev needs to be protected
by mutex.
Fix (un-)plugging functions so pf->adev field is set after aux device
init and prior aux device destroy and protect pf->adev assignment by
new mutex. This mutex is also held during ice\_send\_event\_to\_aux()
call to ensure that aux device is valid during that call.
Note that device lock used ice\_send\_event\_to\_aux() needs to be kept
to avoid race with aux drv unload.
Reproducer:
cycle=1
while :;do
echo "#### Cycle: $cycle"
ip link set ens7f0 mtu 9000
ip link add bond0 type bond mode 1 miimon 100
ip link set bond0 up

ip link set bond0 mtu 9000
ethtool -L ens7f0 combined 1
ip link del bond0
ip link set ens7f0 mtu 1500
sleep 1
let cycle++
done
In short when the device is added/removed to/from bond the aux device
is unplugged/plugged. When MTU of the device is changed an event is
sent to aux device asynchronously. This can race with (un)plugging
operation and because pf->adev is set too early (plug) or too late
(unplug) the function ice\_send\_event\_to\_aux() can touch uninitialized
or destroyed fields. In the case of crash below pf->adev->dev.mutex.

platform/surface: aggregator: Fix initialization order when compiling as builtin module
[ Upstream commit 44acfc22c7d055d9c4f8f0974ee28422405b971a ]
When building the Surface Aggregator Module (SAM) core, registry, and
other SAM client drivers as builtin modules (=y), proper initialization
order is not guaranteed. Due to this, client driver registration
(triggered by device registration in the registry) races against bus
initialization in the core.
If any attempt is made at registering the device driver before the bus
has been initialized (i.e. if bus initialization fails this race) driver
registration will fail with a message similar to:
Driver surface\_battery was unable to register with bus\_type surface\_aggregator because the bus was not initialized
Switch from module\_init() to subsys\_initcall() to resolve this issue.
Note that the serdev subsystem uses postcore\_initcall() so we are still
able to safely register the serdev device driver for the core.

Strictly speaking, the code flow in the driver is still wrong because all

software cleanup (i.e: releasing the framebuffer) should be done in the
.fb\_destroy handler. But this at least makes to match the behavior before

net: mscc: ocelot: avoid corrupting hardware counters when moving VCAP filters
[ Upstream commit 93a8417088ea570b5721d2b526337a2d3aed9fa3 ]
Given the following order of operations:
(1) we add filter A using tc-flower
(2) we send a packet that matches it
(3) we read the filter's statistics to find a hit count of 1
(4) we add a second filter B with a higher preference than A, and A
moves one position to the right to make room in the TCAM for it
(5) we send another packet, and this matches the second filter B
(6) we read the filter statistics again.
When this happens, the hit count of filter A is 2 and of filter B is 1,
despite a single packet having matched each filter.
Furthermore, in an alternate history, reading the filter stats a second
time between steps (3) and (4) makes the hit count of filter A remain at
1 after step (6), as expected.
The reason why this happens has to do with the filter->stats.pkts field,
which is written to hardware through the call path below:
vcap\_entry\_set
/ | \
/ | \
/ | \
/ | \
es0\_entry\_set is1\_entry\_set is2\_entry\_set
\ | /
\ | /
\ | /
vcap\_data\_set(data.counter, ...)
The primary role of filter->stats.pkts is to transport the filter hit
counters from the last readout all the way from vcap\_entry\_get() ->
ocelot\_vcap\_filter\_stats\_update() -> ocelot\_cls\_flower\_stats().
The reason why vcap\_entry\_set() writes it to hardware is so that the
counters (saturating and having a limited bit width) are cleared
after each user space readout.
The writing of filter->stats.pkts to hardware during the TCAM entry
movement procedure is an unintentional consequence of the code design,
because the hit count isn't up to date at this point.
So at step (4), when filter A is moved by ocelot\_vcap\_filter\_add() to
make room for filter B, the hardware hit count is 0 (no packet matched
on it in the meantime), but filter->stats.pkts is 1, because the last
readout saw the earlier packet. The movement procedure programs the old
hit count back to hardware, so this creates the impression to user space
that more packets have been matched than they really were.
The bug can be seen when running the gact\_drop\_and\_ok\_test() from the
tc\_actions.sh selftest.
Fix the issue by reading back the hit count to tmp->stats.pkts before
migrating the VCAP filter. Sure, this is a best-effort technique, since
the packets that hit the rule between vcap\_entry\_get() and
vcap\_entry\_set() won't be counted, but at least it allows the counters
to be reliably used for selftests where the traffic is under control.
The vcap\_entry\_get() name is a bit unintuitive, but it only reads back
the counter portion of the TCAM entry, not the entire entry.
The index from which we retrieve the counter is also a bit unintuitive
(i - 1 during add, i + 1 during del), but this is the way in which TCAM
entry movement works. The "entry index" isn't a stored integer for a
TCAM filter, instead it is dynamically computed by
ocelot\_vcap\_block\_get\_filter\_index() based on the entry's position in
the &block->rules list. That position (as well as block->count) is
automatically updated by ocelot\_vcap\_filter\_add\_to\_block() on add, and
by ocelot\_vcap\_block\_remove\_filter() on del. So "i" is the new filter
index, and "i - 1" or "i + 1" respectively are the old addresses of that
TCAM entry (we only support installing/deleting one filter at a time).

net: mscc: ocelot: restrict tc-trap actions to VCAP IS2 lookup 0
[ Upstream commit 477d2b91623e682e9a8126ea92acb8f684969cc7 ]
Once the CPU port was added to the destination port mask of a packet, it
can never be cleared, so even packets marked as dropped by the MASK\_MODE
of a VCAP IS2 filter will still reach it. This is why we need the
OCELOT\_POLICER\_DISCARD to "kill dropped packets dead" and make software
stop seeing them.
We disallow policer rules from being put on any other chain than the one
for the first lookup, but we don't do this for "drop" rules, although we
should. This change is merely ascertaining that the rules dont't
(completely) work and letting the user know.
The blamed commit is the one that introduced the multi-chain architecture
in ocelot. Prior to that, we should have always offloaded the filters to
VCAP IS2 lookup 0, where they did work.

net: mscc: ocelot: fix VCAP IS2 filters matching on both lookups
[ Upstream commit 6741e11880003e35802d78cc58035057934f4dab ]
The VCAP IS2 TCAM is looked up twice per packet, and each filter can be
configured to only match during the first, second lookup, or both, or
none.
The blamed commit wrote the code for making VCAP IS2 filters match only
on the given lookup. But right below that code, there was another line
that explicitly made the lookup a "don't care", and this is overwriting
the lookup we've selected. So the code had no effect.
Some of the more noticeable effects of having filters match on both
lookups:
- in "tc -s filter show dev swp0 ingress", we see each packet matching a
VCAP IS2 filter counted twice. This throws off scripts such as
tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/tc\_actions.sh and makes them
fail.
- a "tc-drop" action offloaded to VCAP IS2 needs a policer as well,
because once the CPU port becomes a member of the destination port
mask of a packet, nothing removes it, not even a PERMIT/DENY mask mode
with a port mask of 0. But VCAP IS2 rules with the POLICE\_ENA bit in
the action vector can only appear in the first lookup. What happens
when a filter matches both lookups is that the action vector is
combined, and this makes the POLICE\_ENA bit ineffective, since the
last lookup in which it has appeared is the second one. In other
words, "tc-drop" actions do not drop packets for the CPU port, dropped
packets are still seen by software unless there was an FDB entry that
directed those packets to some other place different from the CPU.
The last bit used to work, because in the initial commit b596229448dd
("net: mscc: ocelot: Add support for tcam"), we were writing the FIRST
field of the VCAP IS2 half key with a 1, not with a "don't care".
The change to "don't care" was made inadvertently by me in commit
c1c3993edb7c ("net: mscc: ocelot: generalize existing code for VCAP"),
which I just realized, and which needs a separate fix from this one,
for "stable" kernels that lack the commit blamed below.

net: mscc: ocelot: fix last VCAP IS1/IS2 filter persisting in hardware when deleted
[ Upstream commit 16bbebd35629c93a8c68c6d8d28557e100bcee73 ]
ocelot\_vcap\_filter\_del() works by moving the next filters over the
current one, and then deleting the last filter by calling vcap\_entry\_set()
with a del\_filter which was specially created by memsetting its memory
to zeroes. vcap\_entry\_set() then programs this to the TCAM and action
RAM via the cache registers.
The problem is that vcap\_entry\_set() is a dispatch function which looks
at del\_filter->block\_id. But since del\_filter is zeroized memory, the
block\_id is 0, or otherwise said, VCAP\_ES0. So practically, what we do
is delete the entry at the same TCAM index from VCAP ES0 instead of IS1
or IS2.
The code was not always like this. vcap\_entry\_set() used to simply be
is2\_entry\_set(), and then, the logic used to work.
Restore the functionality by populating the block\_id of the del\_filter
based on the VCAP block of the filter that we're deleting. This makes
vcap\_entry\_set() know what to do.

net: rds: use maybe\_get\_net() when acquiring refcount on TCP sockets
[ Upstream commit 6997fbd7a3dafa754f81d541498ace35b43246d8 ]
Eric Dumazet is reporting addition on 0 problem at rds\_tcp\_tune(), for
delayed works queued in rds\_wq might be invoked after a net namespace's
refcount already reached 0.
Since rds\_tcp\_exit\_net() from cleanup\_net() calls flush\_workqueue(rds\_wq),
it is guaranteed that we can instead use maybe\_get\_net() from delayed work
functions until rds\_tcp\_exit\_net() returns.
Note that I'm not convinced that all works which might access a net
namespace are already queued in rds\_wq by the moment rds\_tcp\_exit\_net()
calls flush\_workqueue(rds\_wq). If some race is there, rds\_tcp\_exit\_net()
will fail to wait for work functions, and kmem\_cache\_free() could be
called from net\_free() before maybe\_get\_net() is called from
rds\_tcp\_tune().

mac80211: Reset MBSSID parameters upon connection
[ Upstream commit 86af062f40a73bf63321694e6bf637144f0383fe ]
Currently MBSSID parameters in struct ieee80211\_bss\_conf
are not reset upon connection. This could be problematic
with some drivers in a scenario where the device first
connects to a non-transmit BSS and then connects to a
transmit BSS of a Multi BSS AP. The MBSSID parameters
which are set after connecting to a non-transmit BSS will
not be reset and the same parameters will be passed on to
the driver during the subsequent connection to a transmit
BSS of a Multi BSS AP.
For example, firmware running on the ath11k device uses the
Multi BSS data for tracking the beacon of a non-transmit BSS
and reports the driver when there is a beacon miss. If we do
not reset the MBSSID parameters during the subsequent
connection to a transmit BSS, then the driver would have
wrong MBSSID data and FW would be looking for an incorrect
BSSID in the MBSSID beacon of a Multi BSS AP and reports
beacon loss leading to an unstable connection.
Reset the MBSSID parameters upon every connection to solve this
problem.

In Chrome OS, a large number of crashes is observed due to corrupted timer

by code calling del\_timer() instead of del\_timer\_sync() just before

batman-adv: Don't skb\_split skbuffs with frag\_list
[ Upstream commit a063f2fba3fa633a599253b62561051ac185fa99 ]
The receiving interface might have used GRO to receive more fragments than
MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS fragments. In this case, these will not be stored in
skb\_shinfo(skb)->frags but merged into the frag list.
batman-adv relies on the function skb\_split to split packets up into
multiple smaller packets which are not larger than the MTU on the outgoing
interface. But this function cannot handle frag\_list entries and is only
operating on skb\_shinfo(skb)->frags. If it is still trying to split such an
skb and xmit'ing it on an interface without support for NETIF\_F\_FRAGLIST,
then validate\_xmit\_skb() will try to linearize it. But this fails due to
inconsistent information. And \_\_pskb\_pull\_tail will trigger a BUG\_ON after
skb\_copy\_bits() returns an error.
In case of entries in frag\_list, just linearize the skb before operating on
it with skb\_split().

> Abstract:We describe a tracking technique for Linux devices, exploiting a new TCP source port generation mechanism recently introduced to the Linux kernel. This mechanism is based on an algorithm, standardized in RFC 6056, for boosting security by better randomizing port selection. Our technique detects collisions in a hash function used in the said algorithm, based on sampling TCP source ports generated in an attacker-prescribed manner. These hash collisions depend solely on a per-device key, and thus the set of collisions forms a device ID that allows tracking devices across browsers, browser privacy modes, containers, and IPv4/IPv6 networks (including some VPNs). It can distinguish among devices with identical hardware and software, and lasts until the device restarts.
>
> We implemented this technique and then tested it using tracking servers in two different locations and with Linux devices on various networks. We also tested it on an Android device that we patched to introduce the new port selection algorithm. The tracking technique works in real-life conditions, and we report detailed findings about it, including its dwell time, scalability, and success rate in different network types. We worked with the Linux kernel team to mitigate the exploit, resulting in a security patch introduced in May 2022 to the Linux kernel, and we provide recommendations for better securing the port selection algorithm in the paper.

Debian Bug     : 922204 1006346 1013299

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4197

    Eric Biederman reported that incorrect permission checks in the
    cgroup process migration implementation can allow a local attacker
    to escalate privileges.

CVE-2022-0494

    The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
    exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO
    capabilities.

CVE-2022-0812

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma)
    miscalculated the size of message headers, which could lead to a
    leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients.

CVE-2022-0854

    Ali Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA
    subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this
    might allow a local user to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1011

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space)
    implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296

    Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness
    in randomisation of TCP source port selection.

CVE-2022-1016

    David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where
    the nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that
    nf_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker
    can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1048

    Hu Jiahui discovered a race condition in the sound subsystem that
    can result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    PCM sound device can take advantage of this flaw to crash the
    system or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1184

    A flaw was discovered in the ext4 filesystem driver which can lead
    to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1195

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the 6pack and mkiss hamradio
    drivers, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1198

    Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1199, CVE-2022-1204, CVE-2022-1205

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-1353

    The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY
    subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an
    IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include
    sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1419

    Minh Yuan discovered a race condition in the vgem virtual GPU
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted
    to access the GPU device can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-1516

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
    set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
    of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1652

    Minh Yuan discovered a race condition in the floppy driver that
    can lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    floppy drive device can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1729

    Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
    which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The
    default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more
    permissive settings have been applied in the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2022-1734

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver
    that could lead to a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1974, CVE-2022-1975

    Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was
    suspectible to denial of service.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-21123, CVE-2022-21125, CVE-2022-21166

    Various researchers discovered flaws in Intel x86 processors,
    collectively referred to as MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.
    These are similar to the previously published Microarchitectural
    Data Sampling (MDS) issues and could be exploited by local users
    to leak sensitive information.

    For some CPUs, the mitigations for these issues require updated
    microcode.  An updated intel-microcode package may be provided at
    a later date.  The updated CPU microcode may also be available as
    part of a system firmware ("BIOS") update.

    Further information on the mitigation can be found at
    <<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/processor_mmio_stale_data.html>>
    or in the linux-doc-4.19 package.

CVE-2022-23960

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Arm processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This was previously mitigated for 32-bit Arm (armel and armhf)
    architectures and is now also mitigated for 64-bit Arm (arm64).

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-26490

    Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver
    can result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-27666

    "valis" reported a possible buffer overflow in the IPsec ESP
    transformation code. A local user can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause a denial of service or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-28356

    "Beraphin" discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
    not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
    local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-28388

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the 8 devices
    USB2CAN interface driver.

CVE-2022-28389

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the Microchip CAN
    BUS Analyzer interface driver.

CVE-2022-28390

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
    CAN/USB interface driver.

CVE-2022-29581

    Kyle Zeng discovered a reference-counting bug in the cls_u32
    network classifier which can lead to a use-after-free. A local
    user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-30594

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and
    seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still
    permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp
    restrictions.

CVE-2022-32250

    Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-33981

    Yuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a race condition in
    the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy
    drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    This ioctl is now disabled by default.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.19.249-2.

Due to an issue in the signing service (Cf. Debian bug #1012741), the
vport-vxlan module cannot be loaded for the signed kernel for amd64 in
this update.

This update also corrects a regression in the network scheduler
subsystem (bug #1013299).

For the 32-bit Arm (armel and armhf) architectures, this update
enables optimised implementations of several cryptographic and CRC
algorithms.  For at least AES, this should remove a timing side-
channel that could lead to a leak of sensitive information.

This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.19.236-4.19.249 inclusive, including for bug #1006346.  The random
driver has been backported from Linux 5.19, fixing numerous
performance and correctness issues.  Some changes will be visible:

- - The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.  You may need
  to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space
  entropy gathering services to allow for this.

- - On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel may log more uses of
  /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised.  These uses were
  previously under-counted and this is not a regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

tcp: increase source port perturb table to 2^16Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad reported being able to accurately
identify a client by forcing it to emit only 40 times more connections
than there are entries in the table\_perturb[] table. The previous two
improvements consisting in resalting the secret every 10s and adding
randomness to each port selection only slightly improved the situation,
and the current value of 2^8 was too small as it's not very difficult
to make a client emit 10k connections in less than 10 seconds.
Thus we're increasing the perturb table from 2^8 to 2^16 so that the
same precision now requires 2.6M connections, which is more difficult in
this time frame and harder to hide as a background activity. The impact
is that the table now uses 256 kB instead of 1 kB, which could mostly
affect devices making frequent outgoing connections. However such
components usually target a small set of destinations (load balancers,
database clients, perf assessment tools), and in practice only a few
entries will be visited, like before.
A live test at 1 million connections per second showed no performance
difference from the previous value.
