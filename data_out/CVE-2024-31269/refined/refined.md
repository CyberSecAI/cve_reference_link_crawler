- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Google Maps plugin for WordPress lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users (like editors) to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of map configurations or other plugin settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user (with editor privileges or higher) into executing the request. This is typically achieved through social engineering, such as sending a link or embedding a malicious element in a website or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and needs to trick a logged-in user with at least editor privileges into executing the request.
