- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application constructs an SQL command using input from the `searccity` parameter without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (CWE-89), possibly related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component) and CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `searccity` argument in the `city.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker, no authentication is required.
