Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file upload sanitization in the File Manager of CMSmadesimple v2.2.18.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The File Manager does not properly sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PDF file.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The uploaded PDF file contains a hidden XSS payload that is executed when the PDF is accessed or rendered within the application, leading to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions including, but not limited to session hijacking, account compromise, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the File Manager's file upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the CMS panel. This could be an administrator or a user with file upload privileges. The attacker is considered a local attacker, implying they have an account on the system.
- The attacker must be able to create a PDF file containing a malicious XSS payload.
