- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `message` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser if the victim is tricked into clicking a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `message` parameter and tricks a user into clicking the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious URL, but does not require any prior authentication or privileged access to the WordPress instance. The attacker relies on social engineering to get a user to click a link.
