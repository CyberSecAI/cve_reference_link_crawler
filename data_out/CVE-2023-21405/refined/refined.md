- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the OSDP message parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The OSDP message parser crashes the `pacsiod` process when processing certain messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A temporary unavailability of door-controlling functionalities, preventing doors from being opened or closed. The device is not further compromised, and no sensitive or customer data can be extracted.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted OSDP message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker capable of sending OSDP messages to vulnerable Axis devices.
