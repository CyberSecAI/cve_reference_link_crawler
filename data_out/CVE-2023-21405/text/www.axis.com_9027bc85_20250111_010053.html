Summary

Knud  from Fraktal.fi  has found  a  flaw in  some Axis Network Door  Controllers and  Axis Network
Intercoms when communicating over  OSDP, highlighting that the OSDP message parser  crashes
the  pacsiod  process,  causing  a  temporary  unavailability  of  the  door-controlling  functionalities
meaning that doors cannot be opened or closed. No sensitive or customer data can be extracted
as the Axis device is not further compromised.

The vulnerability has been assigned a 6.5 (Medium) severity by using the CVSSv3.1 scoring
system. Learn more about the Common Vulnerability Scoring System here.

Solution & Mitigation

Axis has released a patched version for affected devices that increases the robustness of the
OSDP message parser and patches the highlighted flaw. For the AXIS A1601 it is recommended to
update to the latest 10.12 VAPIX track or the 11.6 ACS Secure Entry track. The former 1.84 track is
not supported and will not be patched.

The release notes will state the following:
Corrected CVE-2023-21405. For more information, please visit the Axis vulnerability management portal.

It is recommended to update the Axis device software.
