Knud from Fraktal.fi has found a flaw in some Axis Network Door Controllers and Axis Network
Intercoms when communicating over OSDP, highlighting that the OSDP message parser crashes
the pacsiod process, causing a temporary unavailability of the door-controlling functionalities
meaning that doors cannot be opened or closed. No sensitive or customer data can be extracted
as the Axis device is not further compromised. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information, mitigation and affected products and software versions.
