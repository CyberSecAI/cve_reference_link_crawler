| This seems incredibly unlikely to be exploitable, except in development. If a user of Async was eval()ing user input and passing functions to `autoInject`, they would have bigger problems. |

| [@aearly](https://github.com/aearly), if you think so, can you please look & verify why Snyk is mentioning it as a medium severity vulnerability. If possible kindly provide a new patch version of it, as current version 3.2.5 is causing a Medium CVE which is leading to failure of npm vulnerability scan in our build pipeline |

| [@PPKath-1611](https://github.com/PPKath-1611): I agree with [@aearly](https://github.com/aearly)'s comment in full. Please don't nag the the maintainers; false-positive CVEs are a nuisance for everyone.  I've raised a retraction request in the GitHub repository & am contacting NVD asking them to do the same. <https://github.com/zunak/CVE-2024-39249/issues/1>  If you have a problem with Snyk assessing the 'vulnerability' as medium affecting your builds, contact Snyk, not this maintainer. |

| Yes, thanks for the backup. For reference everyone, the example code provided involved *500* spaces beween `async` and `(args) => {...}` in code a developer would write. It would be as conspicuous in code review as `for(var i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++);`. |
