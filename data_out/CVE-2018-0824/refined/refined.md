Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how "Microsoft COM for Windows" handles serialized objects. Specifically, it fails to properly handle them, leading to a potential security flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of serialized objects within the Microsoft COM component.
- Lack of proper validation or sanitization of serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The provided content focuses on local privilege escalation aspects of the vulnerability. While RCE is mentioned, the main focus is on gaining elevated privileges on the local machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted file to the user, convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website (or use a compromised one) containing a malicious file that exploits the vulnerability. The user would need to be convinced to visit the website and open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted file or a link to a specially crafted file to a targeted user.
- User interaction is needed to open the file (either via email or a web page).
- For privilege escalation, the attacker must already have some form of access to the target system.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content is from Exploit-DB, and links to a blog post with additional information and a proof-of-concept exploit.
- The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft, which addresses the flaw by correcting how the COM component handles serialized objects.
- The description highlights the use of COM and serialized objects as keywords that helped to find this exploit.
- While the CVE description mentions remote code execution, this content emphasizes the local privilege escalation potential.
