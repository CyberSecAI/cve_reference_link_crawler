Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the `file_validity` function of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin fails to adequately check the type of uploaded files, allowing potentially dangerous file types to be uploaded.
- **Missing File Type Validation:** The `file_validity` function in versions up to and including 1.3.94 does not properly validate file extensions against a whitelist or a secure method to verify file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious files like `.svgz`, attackers can inject client-side scripts into the web page, leading to XSS attacks.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain server configurations, uploading specific file types could lead to RCE, giving the attacker control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The file upload vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers. They don't need to have a user account on the WordPress site.
- **Direct File Upload:** Attackers can directly upload malicious files via the plugin's upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or a user account on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to upload files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `wpr-file-upload.php` file within the plugin.
- The fix involves ensuring that file extensions are properly checked against a whitelist *and* a blacklist. The problematic code is in versions of the plugin up to 1.3.94 and is fixed in version 1.3.95 by adding a whitelist and enforcing that the uploaded file's extension is within that list.
- The file `wpr-file-upload.php` was modified to add the `$whitelist` array in the `file_validity` function.
- The problematic file extensions are determined by an exclusion list (blacklist), and SVGZ was not on the blacklist in vulnerable versions of the plugin.

This vulnerability allows for the upload of malicious files by unauthenticated users which could result in XSS or RCE.
