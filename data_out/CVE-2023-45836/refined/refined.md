- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Ultimate Taxonomy Manager plugin (<= 2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions on the website while they are authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could lead to the execution of unwanted actions with the privileges of the targeted user. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can craft a malicious request that is then triggered by a logged-in user, leading to the execution of the attacker's desired action on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into triggering the crafted malicious request, often by sending them a link or embedding the attack into a web page they visit. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but must be able to induce a higher-privileged user to execute an action.
