Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35469:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the Human Resource Management System 1.0, specifically in the `/hrm/user/` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the password parameter during login. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates that an attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain access to the administrator account by using the payload `'or'1'='1` in the password field.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the login form located at `/hrm/user/`.
- The attacker provides malicious SQL code within the password field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to access the login form of the vulnerable application to perform the attack, and the attack can be done anonymously.
- No special privileges are required to execute the attack.
