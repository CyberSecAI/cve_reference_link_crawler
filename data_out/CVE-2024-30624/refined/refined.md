The provided content is related to CVE-2024-30624.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `saveParentControlInfo` function in Tenda FH1205 firmware has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The function reads a user-provided parameter `urls` without any length checks. This allows an attacker to provide an oversized input.
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The oversized input overwrites the stack-based buffer, which can overwrite return addresses and other stack-based data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Overwriting the stack can cause the device to crash.
- Remote code execution (RCE): With carefully crafted overflow data, an attacker can overwrite return addresses, allowing the execution of arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- The `urls` parameter within the POST request is the attack vector, taking an oversized payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda FH1205 router.
- The attacker doesn't require authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
