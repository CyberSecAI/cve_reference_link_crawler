Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1311

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation within the `storeImages` function of the Brizy Page Builder plugin. This function is responsible for handling image uploads during the import of layouts, blocks, or popups.
*   **Weakness:**  The plugin fails to verify the content of uploaded files, allowing for the upload of arbitrary file types, not just images. This is an Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the affected server. This could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an attacker uploads a malicious script (e.g., a PHP file) and is able to execute it.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can upload a malicious file through the plugin's import functionality. This is achieved by crafting a malicious zip archive containing the malicious file in the "images" directory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This level of access is required to import files via the Brizy plugin.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `storeImages` function within the `archiver.php` file of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 2.4.40.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.41 by adding a `validateImageContent` function which validates if the provided content is a valid image.
*   The fix is implemented by checking if the file content is a valid image before creating a media attachment by using the `file_is_valid_image` function.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The provided code snippets show the vulnerable `storeImages` function in the `archiver.php` file and the fix by adding `validateImageContent` function.
*   The patch also contains a fix in the handling of the global styles when importing a layout.
