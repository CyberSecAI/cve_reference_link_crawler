Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-38039:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component. This is a type of injection vulnerability, specifically HTML Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when generating HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML into web pages rendered by the application.
*   This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (depending on the context).

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input that is not correctly sanitized when displayed by the application
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning that the victim needs to interact with the injected code to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have low privileges(PR:L), indicating the attacker may have an account with limited access.
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious data to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
