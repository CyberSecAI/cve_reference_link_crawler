Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36313

**Vulnerability Description:** Reflected XSS in multiple POST parameters of export requests in Callback Widget.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in POST parameters during the export request process in the "Callback Widget" functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the application through vulnerable POST parameters. This code is then reflected back to the user in the application's response, leading to its execution in the user's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user-provided input before processing and outputting it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker might steal session cookies or other sensitive data.
- **Phishing/Redirection:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, display fake login prompts, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the website or display unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the "export requests" functionality within the "Callback Widget".
- The POST request includes the XSS payload within any of the vulnerable POST parameters (except "request_feed" and "password" which uses a different payload).
- The server responds with a page containing the injected script, which is executed in the victim's browser when the page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which POST parameters are vulnerable to XSS injection. This is already identified in the article.
- **Ability to Manipulate Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP POST requests, usually through a tool such as Burp Suite.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameters are part of the export functionality of the "Callback Widget".
- The payload "%3C%2Ftextarea%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E%3C" can be used in most of the POST parameters, while “%22%3E%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E” is used for the "password" parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered as part of a security research project by the "Atlantic CyberSecurity Collective".
- The vendor was notified but did not respond or address the issue.
- This vulnerability is one of multiple vulnerabilities identified in the PHPJabbers product suite.
