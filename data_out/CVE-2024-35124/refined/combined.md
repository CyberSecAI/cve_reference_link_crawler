* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: This Power System update is being released to address CVE-2024-35124

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The BMC is vulnerable during the time it is connected to the network and does not yet have its "admin" account password set.

## Vulnerability Details

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Install and operate the eBMC system on a private network or public network that is behind a firewall.

Immediately after you plug the eBMC system into the network, login to the default admin account of the eBMC system and set the password. You can complete this task by using the eBMC web-based Advanced System Management Interface (ASMI) GUI.

To detect if this problem happened, look on the BMC for administrator accounts you do not recognize and look for any sessions you do not recognize.  Please note for BMCs managed by Hardware Management Consoles (HMC), it is normal for the HMCs to have a BMC session using the "admin" account.

To mitigate this issue, remove any unwanted BMC administrator accounts (being careful to keep your "admin" account) and remove any BMC sessions you do not recognize.  Please note that if your BMC is managed by Hardware Management Console (HMC), it is normal for HMCs to re-establish any lost BMC sessions.

You can use the BMC's ASMi web application to perform these tasks:
- Menu item: Security and access > HMC and user sessions
- Menu item: Security and access > User management

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
