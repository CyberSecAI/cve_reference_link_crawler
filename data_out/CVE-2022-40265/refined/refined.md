**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation when processing specially crafted packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets to the affected device, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device needs to be reset to recover from this state.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote and over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device, but does not need any authentication or special privileges.
