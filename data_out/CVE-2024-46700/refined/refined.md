The provided content relates to a fix for a ring buffer overflow vulnerability in the AMDGPU driver's Message Execution Scheduler (MES). This vulnerability is addressed by the commits: ed37550d7c516017c3b0324bdf144e2fa563ffb0 and 11752c013f562a1124088a35bd314aa0e9f0e88f.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a race condition between writing data to the MES ring buffer and checking for available space. Specifically, the code was not waiting for sufficient room in the ring buffer before writing MES packets, leading to a potential overflow if the ring buffer was not large enough to contain the incoming data. This could occur because the MES ring was not correctly accounting for the amount of data being written to it before waiting for available space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Ring Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a ring buffer overflow in the MES command submission logic. This occurs because the code attempts to write data to the ring buffer without ensuring there is enough space available.
*   **Incorrect Synchronization:** The synchronization mechanism for handling data writes to the MES ring was flawed, not properly accounting for the amount of data being written and not waiting for sufficient space to become available before writing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Kernel Panic/Crash:** A ring buffer overflow in the kernel can lead to a kernel panic or system crash. This could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) situation.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned, a ring buffer overflow, under certain circumstances, can lead to memory corruption, which could potentially be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution in the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the MES command submission in a way that the ring buffer is filled up quickly causing the overflow. This would likely involve sending a large number of MES commands to the AMDGPU driver's message execution scheduler.
*   The attacker would need to have access to the system with sufficient privileges to trigger the flawed code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker would need sufficient privileges to interact with the AMDGPU driver and trigger MES command submission, usually requiring local access to the machine or a vulnerability in user-space code that allows communication with the driver.

**Fix:**
The fix involves the following changes:

*   **Correct `sched_hw_submission` for MES Rings**: The `amdgpu_ring_init` function now sets the `sched_hw_submission` value to 8 for MES rings. This likely reserves 8 units of the ring buffer for MES packets.
*   **Wait for space before writing to ring**: The `mes_v11_0_submit_pkt_and_poll_completion` and `mes_v12_0_submit_pkt_and_poll_completion` functions now implement logic to wait for available space in the ring buffer using `amdgpu_fence_wait_polling` before writing the MES packet.
*  **Undo and Error Handling**: If the wait for space fails, the functions will undo the ring write using `amdgpu_ring_undo` and return an error message.

The fix ensures that the MES ring buffer does not overflow by waiting for enough space to be available before writing data into it and provides proper error handling in case the ring buffer becomes full. It also fixes a potential race condition between the check for available room and actually writing to the ring.
