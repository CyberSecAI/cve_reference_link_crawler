- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface. Specifically, buffer overflow (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77) are mentioned in relation to the multiple CVEs listed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution with root-level privileges or denial of service (DoS) due to unexpected device restarts.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV series routers. This interface is accessible via LAN and potentially WAN if remote management is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
