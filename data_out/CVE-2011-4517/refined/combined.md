How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## JasPer memory corruption vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#887409

Original Release Date: 2011-12-08 | Last Revised: 2012-06-14

---

### Overview

Some versions of JasPer contain multiple vulnerabilities that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| JasPer fails to properly decode marker segments and other sections in malformed JPEG2000 files. Malformed inputs can cause heap buffer overflows which in turn may result in execution of attacker-controlled code.  **CVE-2011-4516**: src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.c: jpc\_cox\_getcompparmsjpc\_cox\_getcomparms is called as part of the decoding of a coding style default (COD) marker segment. The function populates a parameter struct (jpc\_msparms\_t) that is contained in a marker segment struct (jpc\_ms\_t). jpc\_cox\_getcompparms contains a loop that copies data from the input file to the jpc\_msparms\_t struct. The loop terminates on a value (numrlvls) derived from the input file:for (i = 0; i < compparms->numrlvls; ++i) {  if (jpc\_getuint8(in, &tmp)) {    jpc\_cox\_destroycompparms(compparms);  return -1;  }  compparms->rlvls[i].parwidthval = tmp & 0xf;  compparms->rlvls[i].parheightval = (tmp >> 4) & 0xf;}numrlvls is read from the input file. The attacker can control numrlvls to overflow the jpc\_msparms\_t struct and copy attacker-controlled data from the input file into a struct of callback functions (jpc\_msops\_s) that appears in jpc\_ms\_t (src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.h) just after jpc\_msparms\_t:typedef struct {  /\* The type of marker segment. \*/  uint\_fast16\_t id;  /\* The length of the marker segment. \*/  uint\_fast16\_t len;  /\* The starting offset within the stream. \*/  uint\_fast32\_t off;  /\* The parameters of the marker segment. \*/  jpc\_msparms\_t parms;  /\* The marker segment operations. \*/  struct jpc\_msops\_s \*ops;} jpc\_ms\_t;Any subsequent failures in decoding the marker segment will result in the destroyparms member of the callback struct being invoked as part of cleanup. If the attacker has overwritten this callback via the loop above, attacker-controlled values can be loaded into the program counter.**CVE-2011-4517**: src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.c: jpc\_crg\_getparmsjpc\_crg\_getparms is called as part of the decoding of a component registration (CRG) marker segment. This function populates a heap buffer with data derived from the input file (in).The function contains an allocation size/type error. The heap buffer size is calculated using sizeof(uint\_fast16\_t) but the rest of the function assumes sizeof(jpc\_crgcomp\_t).jpc\_crgcomp\_t \*comp;...if (!(crg->comps = jas\_malloc(cstate->numcomps \* sizeof(uint\_fast16\_t)))) {  return -1;}...for (compno = 0, comp = crg->comps; compno < cstate->numcomps;++compno, ++comp) {  if (jpc\_getuint16(in, &comp->hoff) ||    jpc\_getuint16(in, &comp->voff)) {    jpc\_crg\_destroyparms(ms);    return -1;  }}The attacker can overwrite the bytes after crg->comp in memory with arbitrary data. This is a heap buffer overflow, which is generally considered exploitable.There are additional security implications here as well, however. The loop above is controlled by cstate->numcomps (cstate as one member: numcomps). cstate is allocated in a calling function, and is often allocated just before crg->comp. On some platforms the heap chunk allocated for cstate is located just after the heap chunk allocated for crg->comp, separated by only 4 bytes of heap accounting info. The accounting info + cstate (8 bytes after crg->comp) can be overwritten with bytes from the input file via the loop above. In these cases, the attacker can place a large number in cstate->numcomps to make the loop above iterate past the expected bound of crg->comps and copy an arbitrary number of bytes from the input file into heap (a heap buffer overflow). This enables the attacker to perform well-known heap exploitations, as well as allowing the attacker to overwrite other active heap allocations such as the callback pointers referenced in the previous bug description. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By tricking a user into opening or previewing an image file in an application that decodes images with the JasPer library, an attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Users who obtain JasPer from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. |
| --- |

| Please consider the following workarounds:**Avoid processing malicious image files**Turn off image preview features in file browsers and other applications that use the JasPer library. Avoid opening image attachments from untrusted or unrecognized sources. |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0698)

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2012verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all its secure variants (if applicable) are affected too. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1374524.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1374524.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update.

# USN-1315-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

20 December 2011

JasPer could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) - Library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files

## Details

Jonathan Foote discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libjasper1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper)
  -
  [1.900.1-7ubuntu2.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-7ubuntu2.11.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libjasper1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper)
  -
  [1.900.1-7ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-7ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libjasper1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper)
  -
  [1.900.1-7ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-7ubuntu0.10.04.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : jasper
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4516 CVE-2011-4517

Two buffer overflows were discovered in JasPer, a library for handling
JPEG-2000 images, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.900.1-5.1+lenny2. Due to technical limitations of the Debian
archive software, the oldstable update cannot be released synchronously
with the stable update.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.900.1-7+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
