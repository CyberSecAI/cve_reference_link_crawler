Package        : jasper
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4516 CVE-2011-4517

Two buffer overflows were discovered in JasPer, a library for handling
JPEG-2000 images, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.900.1-5.1+lenny2. Due to technical limitations of the Debian
archive software, the oldstable update cannot be released synchronously
with the stable update.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.900.1-7+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.
