- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Optima Express + MarketBoost IDX Plugin for WordPress, in versions 7.3.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts. The content also mentions the required privilege as "Administrator", suggesting that the XSS might be triggered when an administrator performs certain actions or is tricked into interacting with malicious input, but the exact way to trigger the XSS is not detailed.
