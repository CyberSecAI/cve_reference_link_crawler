- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfiguration within the Smartplay headunit software that does not adequately secure sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to misconfiguration.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Privacy breach through exposure of PII.
    - Unauthorized access to headunit functions and potentially vehicle systems.
    - Potential for further security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the misconfiguration via the headunit software to access exposed data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable headunit software to exploit the misconfiguration.
