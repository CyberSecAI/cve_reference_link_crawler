- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is susceptible to SSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided information does not detail the specific impact but SSRF can potentially allow an attacker to make requests to internal services or external resources as if they were originating from the vulnerable server, which could lead to information disclosure, service disruption or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based and involves exploiting the vulnerable server through crafted requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable IBM InfoSphere Information Server. Specific technical details on how to trigger the SSRF are not given.
