The provided content relates to a commit that fixes an issue related to the secure flag for cookies in phpMyFAQ.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code had an inadequate check for the HTTPS protocol when setting the secure flag for cookies. It only checked if `$_SERVER['HTTPS']` was set to 'ON', which could be bypassed if the value was different.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure cookie flag handling: The secure flag for cookies was not being set correctly, potentially allowing cookies to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.
- Specifically, the original logic `if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && strtoupper((string) $_SERVER['HTTPS']) === 'ON')` only checks for 'ON', potentially missing other valid values for HTTPS being enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If the secure flag is not properly set, an attacker could potentially intercept the cookie if the user accesses the site via HTTP, leading to session hijacking or other related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks, especially on networks where both HTTP and HTTPS are available. An attacker could intercept HTTP traffic and gain access to session cookies if the secure flag isn't set.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic, for example, through a man-in-the-middle attack on a network where HTTP is used.

**Additional details:**
- The commit includes changes in both `phpmyfaq/src/phpMyFAQ/Session.php` and `phpmyfaq/src/phpMyFAQ/Session/Token.php`.
- The fix replaces the older, less robust HTTPS check `if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && strtoupper((string) $_SERVER['HTTPS']) === 'ON')` with a more comprehensive check `(!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] !== 'off') || $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] === 443`.
- It also adds several attributes to the `setcookie` function in `phpmyfaq/src/phpMyFAQ/Session/Token.php` including the `path`, `domain`, `samesite`, `secure` and `httponly` attributes to properly secure cookies.
