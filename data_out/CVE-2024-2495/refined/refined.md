Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2495
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a cryptographic key being stored in plain text within the FriendlyWrt firmware.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-321): The cryptographic key is not properly protected and is stored in plain text.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Compromise of Confidentiality: An attacker could gain access to the cryptographic key, potentially decrypting sensitive data.
    *   Compromise of Integrity: With access to the key, an attacker might be able to manipulate or forge encrypted data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access (AV:L) is required
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   No user interaction (UI:N) is required.
    *   The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), meaning a compromise in the vulnerable component will have impact beyond that component.
*   **Affected Resources:** FriendlyWrt, version 2022-11-16.51b3d35.
