The provided content relates to CVE-2024-7218.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` field when saving student data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code could be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected data, leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Theft of sensitive user data
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/admin/ajax.php?action=save_student` endpoint with malicious JavaScript code in the `name` parameter. The user would need to have access to the admin panel in order to exploit it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. They would also require an authenticated session with access to the admin panel of the application in order to make the malicious request.
