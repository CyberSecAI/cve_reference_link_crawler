Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34361

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl()` function within Pi-hole, which allows an authenticated user to make internal requests to the server using various protocols, including `file://`, `ftp://`, `smb://`, `ldap://`, `gopher://`, and others. This lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the URL protocols allows an attacker to potentially perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SSRF:** The primary vulnerability is a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), where the attacker can cause the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
*   **Unrestricted Protocol Support:** The `curl` command used in the function accepts a wide range of protocols without proper validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The URL is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary protocols and internal addresses such as `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The SSRF vulnerability, especially when combined with protocols like `gopher://`, allows for Remote Code Execution on the server. By crafting a specific payload, the attacker can interact with other services running on the same server such as Redis and create files or execute commands.
*   **Internal Network Reconnaissance:** By making requests to internal IPs or services, an attacker could gather information about the internal network.
*   **Access to Internal Services:** An attacker could potentially abuse the SSRF to interact with internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated on the Pi-hole web interface.
*   The attacker modifies the URL used when adding or updating an adlist.
*   The attacker can utilize various protocols to achieve SSRF

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the Pi-hole web interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Pi-hole instance.
*   **Understanding of Target Services:** To achieve RCE, the attacker needs an understanding of services running on the Pi-hole server (e.g., Redis, MySQL) to craft the required payloads.

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory includes a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The PoC uses the `gopher://` protocol to interact with a Redis server and create a PHP shell on the Pi-hole server, which can then be used to execute commands on the server.
*   The vulnerability is present in Pi-hole versions <= 5.18.2 and patched in versions >= v5.18.3
*   The CVSS score is 8.6, classified as "High" severity.
