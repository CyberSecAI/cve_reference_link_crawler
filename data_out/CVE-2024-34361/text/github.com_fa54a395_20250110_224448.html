This code addition broke my lists that have been working fine for 6 years. It took me a while to find that this was why. Can the error message be made to be more obvious of why adlists that had always been working suddenly stopped? Maybe a "Try <http://localhost/adblock.txt> instead of localhost/adblock.txt" or something to help clue us in as to what happened? Thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.
