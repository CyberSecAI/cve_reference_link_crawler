Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31008:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Shovel and Federation plugins in RabbitMQ used a predictable secret to seed the encryption key for URI obfuscation, instead of a cluster-wide secret.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable secret used for encryption. This weakness in the obfuscation mechanism allows an attacker to potentially deobfuscate the data.
- Information disclosure of sensitive data in logs

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information within the URI, such as credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys, etc.), if they were embedded in the URI.
- The information could be found in node logs under specific exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the server's logs is required.
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger exceptions related to the Shovel or Federation plugins to have the obfuscated data written to the node logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have low-level access to the system hosting the RabbitMQ server to read the logs.
- The attacker does not need user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, but needs to have a way to trigger exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.5
- Patches were released in versions 3.10.2, 3.9.18, and 3.8.32, which fix the issue by using a cluster-wide secret for URI obfuscation.
- As a workaround, the Shovel and Federation plugins can be disabled.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Lajos Gerecs and Anh Nguyen from Erlang Solutions.
