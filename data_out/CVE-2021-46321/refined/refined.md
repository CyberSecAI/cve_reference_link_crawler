The content is related to CVE-2021-46321.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `wifiBasicCfg` module of the Tenda router's firmware. The program reads user input from the `wifiSSID` parameter of a POST request to `/goform/setWifi` without checking its length. This unchecked input is then used in `sprintf` or `strcpy` functions, leading to a buffer overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing input validation. Specifically, the `wifiSSID` parameter is not length-checked before being used in string manipulation functions.

- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. Furthermore, with carefully crafted overflow data, remote code execution (RCE) could also be possible.

- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user sends a crafted POST request to `/goform/setWifi` containing an overly long `wifiSSID` value.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This likely implies the attacker needs network access to the router, possibly as a user on the local network, or potentially through a vulnerable external facing service.
