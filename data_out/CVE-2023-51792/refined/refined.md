{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The issue is due to a large allocation size requested by the libde265 library exceeding the maximum supported size. Specifically, the requested allocation size is 0xffffffffffff5b00 (0xffffffffffff6b00 after adjustments), while the maximum supported size is 0x10000000000.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is improper input validation leading to an attempt to allocate excessive memory."
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) as it exhausts system storage space. The large allocation will cause the system to run out of memory, potentially crashing the application or causing system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted h.265 bitstream that triggers the excessive memory allocation within the libde265 decoder. This input needs to be processed by the vulnerable library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious h.265 bitstream to the vulnerable application using the libde265 library. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or to be on the same system to cause the vulnerability as long as the vulnerable software processes the crafted stream.",
	"additional_details": "The issue was discovered through fuzzing with ASAN enabled which produced the log showing the excessive allocation request. It's recommended to reproduce this in a docker environment as the vulnerability can cause the host OS and storage space to be affected."
