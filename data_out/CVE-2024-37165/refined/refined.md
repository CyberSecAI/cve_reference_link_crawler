Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of Onebox data, specifically related to Facebook Oneboxes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious data embedded in a Facebook Onebox could be stored and later executed when a user views the content.
*  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization of the data retrieved by Onebox, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a user's browser when they view a post with a malicious Onebox.
*   **Account Takeover:** If a user's browser executes malicious JavaScript, it could potentially be used for session hijacking or other forms of account compromise
*   **Data Theft**: The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data through crafted XSS payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based and relies on the server processing and rendering malicious Onebox data.
*   **Facebook Onebox:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious content within a Facebook Onebox, which is a feature that embeds previews of URLs into posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs to be able to post/share content with a malicious Onebox to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The XSS is stored, meaning the victim user doesn't have to interact with the malicious link directly, only view a post containing the Onebox.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered **moderate** severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3.
*   The vulnerability affects Discourse versions prior to stable 3.2.3 and beta/tests-passed 3.3.0.beta3.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by ensuring Content Security Policy is enabled and does not include `unsafe-inline`.

The provided commits show the code changes related to fixing the vulnerability by adjusting the regex for matching facebook URLs. The change ensures that the `www.` subdomain is optional in the facebook URLs, which suggests that the XSS vulnerability might have been related to how the code was processing/sanitizing URL data coming from different forms of Facebook URLs.
