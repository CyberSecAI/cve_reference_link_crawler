Hello Jacques, thanks for the reply. I'd like to suggest that this policy
should receive a review, as other list members have found the Apache
defaults a bit wanting:

This is nice, and friendly.

This is also nice and friendly.

This information is gold!

The link to the security page is a good start; it's even one of the better
security.html pages I've seen. (Thanks!) But we've all spent too much time
trying to figure out what exactly might have been "the intended content"
on a page five or ten years later. Having more specific information (such
as the "582add7d3" here) directly available in the list archives will
simplify future searches for information.

Thank you :)
