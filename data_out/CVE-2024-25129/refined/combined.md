[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

### Security patches

* Fixes CVE-2024-25129, a limited data exfiltration vulnerability that could be triggered by untrusted databases or QL packs. See the [security advisory](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/security/advisories/GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph) for more information.

### New Features

* A new extractor option has been added to the Python extractor. Pass one of `--extractor-option python_executable_name=py` or `--extractor-option python_executable_name=python` or `--extractor-option python_executable_name=python3` to `codeql database create` (or `codeql database trace-command` or, for indirect tracing, `codeql database init`) to override the default Python executable search and selection behavior of the Python extractor. For example, on Windows machines, the Python extractor will expect to find `py.exe` on the system `PATH` by default. Setting this extractor option or environment variable allows overriding this behavior to look for a different name.

  More detail can be found in [the extractor option documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/extractor-options).

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed a bug where CodeQL may produce an invalid database when it exhausts all available ID numbers. Now it detects the condition and reports an error instead.

For more information about the changes included in this release, see the [CodeQL CLI changelog](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md).

You can download *either* the `codeql-PLATFORM.zip` for your platform, *or* the generic `codeql.zip` which contains binaries for all supported platforms. Please ignore the additional "source code" downloads below the `.zip` artifacts.

This release is compatible with the CodeQL language packs from [`github/codeql@codeql-cli/v2.16.3`](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/v2.16.3).

# Limited data exfiltration in CodeQL CLI

Low

[hmakholm](/hmakholm)
published
GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph
Feb 22, 2024

## Package

CodeQL CLI

## Affected versions

< 2.16.3

## Patched versions

2.16.3

## Description

[I Al Istannen](https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/) and [Simon Gerst](https://github.com/intrigus-lgtm) discovered that an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files was vulnerable to [XXE](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing).

### Impact

If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified *CodeQL database*, or a specially prepared set of *QL query sources*, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to a URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in exfiltration of secrets from the local file system.

Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted.

A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system.

The typical use case for customers of GitHub Advanced Security code scanning on GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server -- using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted query packs -- is *not affected*. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database is not vulnerable.

(Note that, independently of this security advisory, using CodeQL to analyze an *untrusted* source tree inherently involves running build commands provided in that source tree, so this should only ever be done in an appropriately locked-down and sandboxed environment. If the *database* produced during such an analysis is subsequently copied out of the sandbox for offline analysis, it should be treated as untrusted).

### Patches

The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI, published on 2024-02-22.

Security researchers and QL authors using the default settings of the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio will be automatically prompted to upgrade to the latest version of the CodeQL CLI. If using a specific local version of the CodeQL CLI, please update this local version to 2.16.3 or later.

Optional updates:

* Customers using the default settings for code scanning on GitHub.com do not need to take any action to upgrade to this version.
* Customers using a specific `tools` version in code scanning advanced setup workflows on GitHub.com may optionally choose to update this `tools` URL, or remove the field to use the latest version of CodeQL by default.
* Customers on GitHub Enterprise Server may optionally choose to upgrade the version of CodeQL used in their code scanning Actions workflows using GitHub Connect or the CodeQL Action Sync Tool - see [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance) for more information.
* Customers using the CodeQL CLI in a third-party CI system may optionally choose to update to the latest version of CodeQL.

### Workarounds

Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection.

GHAS customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe.

If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiles is trusted. We recommend that all other *development* of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.

### References

<https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/java/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-611/XXELocal.ql> is a CodeQL query that *would have* found this vulnerability. It is usually disabled because a high risk of false positives. Java projects that know they will never need to parse XML that depends on document-provided DTDs may want to enable it in their own CodeQL analysis.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
