### Security patches

* Fixes CVE-2024-25129, a limited data exfiltration vulnerability that could be triggered by untrusted databases or QL packs. See the [security advisory](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/security/advisories/GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph) for more information.

### New Features

* A new extractor option has been added to the Python extractor. Pass one of `--extractor-option python_executable_name=py` or `--extractor-option python_executable_name=python` or `--extractor-option python_executable_name=python3` to `codeql database create` (or `codeql database trace-command` or, for indirect tracing, `codeql database init`) to override the default Python executable search and selection behavior of the Python extractor. For example, on Windows machines, the Python extractor will expect to find `py.exe` on the system `PATH` by default. Setting this extractor option or environment variable allows overriding this behavior to look for a different name.

  More detail can be found in [the extractor option documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/extractor-options).

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed a bug where CodeQL may produce an invalid database when it exhausts all available ID numbers. Now it detects the condition and reports an error instead.

For more information about the changes included in this release, see the [CodeQL CLI changelog](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md).

You can download *either* the `codeql-PLATFORM.zip` for your platform, *or* the generic `codeql.zip` which contains binaries for all supported platforms. Please ignore the additional "source code" downloads below the `.zip` artifacts.

This release is compatible with the CodeQL language packs from [`github/codeql@codeql-cli/v2.16.3`](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/v2.16.3).
