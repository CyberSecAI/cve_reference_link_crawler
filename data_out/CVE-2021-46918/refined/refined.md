The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46918.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:** The Intel IDXD driver did not properly clear MSIX permission entries during device shutdown. Specifically, the MSIX entries and pasid entries were left programmed after device shutdown.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a resource leak or improper resource management issue where MSIX permission entries are not cleared or disabled after the device is no longer in use. This could lead to a state where stale or incorrect configurations are left in the system.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is not immediately apparent but could possibly lead to issues such as:
*   Resource exhaustion if many devices are repeatedly initialized and shutdown without proper cleanup.
*   Potential conflicts or undefined behavior if the stale configurations interact with other parts of the system.
*   Possibly could be used in combination with another vulnerability to escalate privileges, although this is not clear from the provided context.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector would involve repeatedly bringing the idxd devices up and down or potentially through another method, manipulating the state of the idxd driver to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the idxd driver, which would require a privileged position within the system. This may involve root-level access or being able to trigger operations that utilize the affected driver.
