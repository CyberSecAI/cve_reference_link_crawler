- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the server's response headers disclosing build and service versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure is the main weakness. The server unnecessarily includes sensitive version information in its response headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain insight into the specific versions of software running on the server, which could assist them in identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in those specific versions. The impact is considered low due to the limited scope of the information disclosed.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through network requests to the affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable server (adjacent network) or be able to intercept the network traffic. No special access or user interaction is required.
