### CVE-2024-1767
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes such as 'className' and 'radius' within the Blocksy theme's blocks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**:  Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject malicious code through the theme's block attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least contributor-level permissions.
