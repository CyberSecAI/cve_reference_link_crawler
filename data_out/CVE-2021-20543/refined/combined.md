# Security Bulletin: IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management is vulnerable to HTML injection.(CVE-2021-20543)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Summary guidance: The Jazz Team Server allows administrators to install custom process templates. These custom templates can optionally have custom (HTML or JavaScript) code in them. This is a feature that many customers use, but it is not without risk. We strongly encourage administrators to only install custom process templates after a thorough review of the code changes and that they come from a trusted source. Failure to exercise caution can leave the server vulnerable to HTML injection an attack that is similar to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). While in the XSS vulnerability the attacker can inject and execute JavaScript code, the HTML injection attack only allows the injection of certain HTML tags. When an application does not properly handle user-supplied data, an attacker can supply valid HTML code, typically via a parameter value, and inject their own content into the page. This attack is typically used in conjunction with some form of social engineering, as the attack is exploiting a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust. We have added the following reminder/warning message when uploading custom process templates: "Ensure that the process template that you uploaded is from a trusted source."
