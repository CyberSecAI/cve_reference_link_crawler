- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pligg CMS V2.0.2 application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability exists in the `admin_page.php` component. The application does not adequately validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to induce unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to delete links by submitting a crafted request without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (as shown in the provided PoC) that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, sends a delete request to `admin_page.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page they control. The attacker does not need direct access to the administrator's machine.
