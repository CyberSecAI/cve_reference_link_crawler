RHSA-2024:6497 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2024-09-09
Updated:
2024-09-09
# RHSA-2024:6497 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Images](#containers)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift image enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

A new image is available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10, running on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 and 3.11, and 4.3. This is a
security update with Moderate impact rating.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is an integrated sign-on solution, available as a
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift containerized image. The Red Hat
Single Sign-On for OpenShift image provides an authentication server that
you can use to log in centrally, log out, and register. You can also manage
user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web
services.

This erratum releases a new image for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for
use within the OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, OpenShift Container Platform
3.11, and within the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for
on-premise or private cloud deployments, aligning with the standalone product release.

Security fixes:

* potential bypass of brute force protection (CVE-2024-4629)
* session fixation in elytron saml adapters (CVE-2024-7341)
* Leak of configured LDAP bind credentials through the Keycloak admin console (CVE-2024-5967)

## Solution

To update to the latest Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift
image, Follow these steps to pull in the content:

1. On your main hosts, ensure you are logged into the CLI as a
cluster administrator or user with project administrator access
to the global "openshift" project. For example:

$ oc login -u system:admin

2. Update the core set of Red Hat Single Sign-On resources for OpenShift
in the "openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ for resource in sso76-image-stream.json \
sso76-https.json \
sso76-mysql.json \
sso76-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-postgresql.json \
sso76-postgresql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-https.json \
sso76-x509-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.10.GA/templates/$](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.10.GA/templates/%24){resource}
done

3. Install the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.10 for OpenShift streams in the
"openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-sso76-openshift:1.0

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-07-31 15:15:26 UTC  ``` The SAML adapter is expected to change the sesion ID (and the respective JSESSIONID cookie) when the login is performed (except if the option turnOffChangeSessionIdOnLogin is true). This way the session ID is modified in the login to change the previous non-authenticated ID to a new one and avoid using the same valiue (just to protect against a possible cookie hijacking).  Requirements to exploit: You need to hijack the current session before authentication and it will  be valid after it. Session fixation issue.  Component affected:  org.keycloak.services  Version affected: <= 25.0.2 (also present in RHBK and RHSSO elytron  variant).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2024:6499 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6499](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6499)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:6493 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6493](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6493)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:00:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6494)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:02:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6501 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6501](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6501)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:6502 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6502)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6503)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:06:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6500 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6500](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6500)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:07:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:6495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6495)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:12:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c10)  Patricia Sheats    2024-10-16 10:07:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to errata-xmlrpc from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c9)) > This issue has been addressed in the following products: >  >   RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers >  > Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497) <https://101games.io>  Yess   ``` |  |
