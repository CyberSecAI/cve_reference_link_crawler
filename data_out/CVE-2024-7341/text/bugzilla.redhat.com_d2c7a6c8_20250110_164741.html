| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-07-31 15:15:26 UTC  ``` The SAML adapter is expected to change the sesion ID (and the respective JSESSIONID cookie) when the login is performed (except if the option turnOffChangeSessionIdOnLogin is true). This way the session ID is modified in the login to change the previous non-authenticated ID to a new one and avoid using the same valiue (just to protect against a possible cookie hijacking).  Requirements to exploit: You need to hijack the current session before authentication and it will  be valid after it. Session fixation issue.  Component affected:  org.keycloak.services  Version affected: <= 25.0.2 (also present in RHBK and RHSSO elytron  variant).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2024:6499 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6499](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6499)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 15:58:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:6493 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6493](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6493)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:00:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:6494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6494)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:02:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6501 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6501](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6501)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:6502 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6502)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:05:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6503)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:06:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:6500 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6500](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6500)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:07:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:6495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6495)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-09-09 16:12:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c10)  Patricia Sheats    2024-10-16 10:07:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to errata-xmlrpc from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=2302064#c9)) > This issue has been addressed in the following products: >  >   RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers >  > Via RHSA-2024:6497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A6497) <https://101games.io>  Yess   ``` |  |
