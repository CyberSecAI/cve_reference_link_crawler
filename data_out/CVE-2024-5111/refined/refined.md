Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `date` parameter within the `/view/student_payment_invoice1.php` file of the Complete Web-Based School Management System. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `date` parameter, leading to unauthorized database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user and system data can be leaked by exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Compromised System Security:** The system's security can be severely compromised, potentially leading to further attacks and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `date` parameter in an HTTP GET request to `/view/student_payment_invoice1.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific user privileges within the application are explicitly mentioned as necessary for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The provided payload `date=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(2)%2C0))XOR'Z` demonstrates how an attacker could inject a SQL query using the vulnerable parameter.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Campcodes Complete Web-Based School Management System" version 1.0 or earlier.
