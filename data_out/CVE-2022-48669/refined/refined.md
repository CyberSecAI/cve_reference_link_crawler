The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48669.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `papr_get_attr` function within the PowerPC pseries architecture code. Specifically, the function allocates memory for `buf` and attempts to reallocate it using `krealloc`. If `krealloc` fails, the original `buf` is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The primary weakness is a memory leak caused by failing to free the originally allocated buffer when `krealloc` fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated calls to `papr_get_attr` that trigger the failure of `krealloc` could lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the condition where `krealloc` fails within the `papr_get_attr` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to execute code that calls the vulnerable function `papr_get_attr` on a system with the affected PowerPC pseries architecture.
