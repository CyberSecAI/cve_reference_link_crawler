Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the server deserializing untrusted data from client cookies using the `pickle` library. The `pickle` library is known to be unsafe when used to deserialize data from untrusted sources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization of cookie data using `pickle`.
- The code used `pickle.loads` to deserialize base64-encoded data from cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because an attacker can craft malicious pickled data.
- A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the application, including data breaches, service disruptions, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker sends malicious base64 encoded pickled data via the clientâ€™s cookie.
- The application decodes and deserializes the data without validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges and no user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests, including setting arbitrary cookie values.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions 3.64 to 3.73 of the gpt_academic project.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.74 by replacing the pickle library with JSON.
- The `theme.py` file was modified to change cookie serialization from pickle to json.
- The official website `https://academic.chatwithpaper.org/` was used to demonstrate a proof of concept with a rebound shell.
