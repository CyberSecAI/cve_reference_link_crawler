Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-41723:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause excessive CPU consumption in the HPACK decoder. Specifically, when parsing a field literal containing two Huffman-encoded strings, the decoder would not verify all data is present before decoding the first string. This resulted in a forced quadratic complexity when repeatedly parsing a partial field, repeating the Huffman decoding of the string on each iteration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Quadratic complexity in HPACK decoding within the `net/http` and `golang.org/x/net/http2` packages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption. An attacker can cause this with "a small number of small requests".

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream. This can be done by a remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to a server handling HTTP/2 traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to a vulnerable server or client.
- Ability to send malicious HTTP/2 streams.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in `golang.org/x/net/http2` v0.7.0 and Go versions 1.20.1 and 1.19.6.
- The issue also affects `net/http` in Go and can be fixed by updating the `golang.org/x/net` package or upgrading to a patched Go version.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-400, which pertains to uncontrolled resource consumption.
- The vulnerability affects both clients and servers.
-  The fix involves avoiding Huffman decoding of the first string in a field literal until verifying all data is present.

This vulnerability is present in:
- `dev-lang/go` versions prior to 1.20.10.
- `golang.org/x/net/http2` versions prior to v0.7.0.
- Go versions before 1.19.6 and from 1.20.0-0 before 1.20.1.
- Several Fedora packages that use Go, including `skopeo`, `podman-tui` and `doctl`.

The vulnerability was addressed in various products that use Go including:
- NetApp's Astra Trident.
- Couchbase Server (by upgrading to Go version 1.19.9).
- `hashicorp/consul-dataplane`.
- `vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework`.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description by specifying the root cause of the vulnerability (quadratic complexity in HPACK decoding due to unnecessary repeated Huffman decoding) and identifying the affected code components. It also outlines specific versions of software that are vulnerable and which have patched the vulnerability.
