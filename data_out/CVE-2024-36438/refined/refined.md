Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of easily replicated MIFARE Classic 1K cards (ISO14443-3) for the eLinkSmart Hidden Smart Cabinet Lock. These cards can be easily copied and emulated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** Although not explicitly stated in the advisory, the underlying issue is a lack of sufficient security measures to prevent unauthorized access via duplicated or emulated cards. The lock relies solely on the presence of a valid card, without verifying the card's authenticity or preventing replay attacks of copied credentials.
- **Use of vulnerable NFC technology:** The reliance on MIFARE Classic 1K cards, known to be vulnerable to cloning and emulation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can easily unlock the cabinet lock by copying or emulating a legitimate NFC card, bypassing the intended security mechanism.
- **Compromise of Secured Contents:** This enables attackers to gain access to the contents of the cabinet which could include sensitive items.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **NFC Card Duplication:**  Attackers can copy the data from a legitimate card onto a "magic card" that allows changing the serial number.
- **NFC Card Emulation:** Attackers can emulate a legitimate card by using devices like a Flipper Zero, allowing for repeated unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Proximity:**  Attackers need physical access to a legitimate NFC card to copy or emulate its data.
- **Technical Skill:** Attackers require the technical knowledge to use tools like Flipper Zero to perform the card copying and emulation process. They also need the tools themselves, or equivalent technologies.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory highlights the ease with which the attack can be performed, using readily available tools like the Flipper Zero.
- The advisory recommends using more secure NFC card technology with security features, to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vendor was notified but a patch was not available at the time the advisory was written.
