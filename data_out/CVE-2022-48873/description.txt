In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Don't remove map on creater_process and device_release

Do not remove the map from the list on error path in
fastrpc_init_create_process, instead call fastrpc_map_put, to avoid
use-after-free. Do not remove it on fastrpc_device_release either,
call fastrpc_map_put instead.

The fastrpc_free_map is the only proper place to remove the map.
This is called only after the reference count is 0.
