The provided content is related to CVE-2024-3794.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/admin/AdvancedSystem` section, specifically in the description field of WBSAirback 21.02.04.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `description` field within `/admin/AdvancedSystem` section.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to a victim user.
- If the victim user opens the URL, the attacker's malicious script will be executed in the victim's browser within the context of the WBSAirback application.
- The attacker can potentially steal the victim's session data (e.g. cookies), and perform actions with the victim's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is initiated by enticing a user to click a malicious link containing the crafted XSS payload in the `description` field of the `/admin/AdvancedSystem` page.
- The attacker can inject the payload within the vulnerable field of the WBSAirback web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to inject the malicious script into the `description` field of the `/admin/AdvancedSystem` page.
- The attacker must then induce a victim user to visit the page (or a page using the stored XSS), possibly through social engineering or by sharing a malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to have high privileges, as any user able to access and modify the affected fields is capable of injecting the payload, and any user with access to the application could potentially be a victim.
