Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-35977**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cros_ec_uart_probe()` function in the Linux kernel driver `drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec_uart.c` calls `devm_serdev_device_open()` before calling `serdev_device_set_client_ops()`. This creates a race condition because `devm_serdev_device_open()` sets `SERPORT_ACTIVE`, and if a receive operation happens before `serdev_device_set_client_ops()` is called, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference in `serdev_controller_receive_buf()` because `serdev->ops` will be NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: The driver opens the serial device before setting up its client operations (`ops`), leading to a timing window where `serdev->ops` can be NULL when data is received.
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access `serdev->ops->receive_buf` without ensuring `serdev->ops` is initialized, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The NULL pointer dereference causes a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a data receive event after `devm_serdev_device_open()` is called but before `serdev_device_set_client_ops()` is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to trigger serial data reception on the affected UART device during the vulnerable window. This likely requires some form of control over the device.

**Additional Details:**

The provided patches reorder the calls in `cros_ec_uart_probe()` to ensure that `serdev_device_set_client_ops()` is called before `devm_serdev_device_open()`. This ensures the `serdev->ops` are initialized before the device is opened. This fix addresses a previous attempt to fix a similar race condition that widened the vulnerability window instead.
