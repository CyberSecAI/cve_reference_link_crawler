- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XXE injection vulnerability, which allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information or conduct other malicious activities by exploiting the way the application parses XML input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not explicitly detailed beyond the general risks of an XXE injection vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit malicious XML to the affected application.
