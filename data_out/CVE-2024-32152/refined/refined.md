- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a blocklist to prevent the usage of specific LaTeX commands that could lead to file operations. This blocklist can be bypassed by encoding characters within the blocked commands using hexadecimal representation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete blacklist (CWE-184). The application fails to prevent the execution of dangerous LaTeX commands due to inadequate filtering of hex-encoded characters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create arbitrary files with arbitrary content in the application's temporary directory on the user's system. This could be used for various malicious purposes, including denial of service, data exfiltration, or further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious flashcard using LaTeX that utilizes hex encoded characters to bypass the blocklist.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to share the malicious flashcard with a victim user. The victim must use the card within the vulnerable Anki application for the vulnerability to trigger. No special privileges are required.
