**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the "notes view" feature of ScienceLogic SL1. This occurs because the application takes unsanitized user-controlled input and directly includes it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database. This could allow for a range of malicious actions, including:
    - Unauthorized data access (read)
    - Data modification (write)
    - Potential for full compromise of the database and possibly the system itself

**Attack vectors:**
- Network attack
- Specifically, the "notes view" feature is the entry point

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges are required: An authenticated user with access to the "notes view" feature is sufficient
- No user interaction needed for the exploitation

**Affected Products:**
- ScienceLogic SL1 <= 11.1.2

**Software Fixes:**
- Update to the latest version of ScienceLogic SL1.
