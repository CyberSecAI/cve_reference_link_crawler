Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application lacks proper validation of external input used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `orderBy` parameter from the HTTP request is directly incorporated into the SQL query without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation on the `orderBy` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  The application has an authentication bypass vulnerability. If the URL contains `/admin/login` or `/admin/account`, the filter for permission verification is bypassed allowing unauthorized access to all backend interfaces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, allowing them to access, modify, or delete sensitive database data.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, successful SQL injection can lead to full database and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/order` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `orderBy` parameter.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The authentication bypass is achieved by including specific path components (`/admin/login` or `/admin/account`) in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate HTTP GET requests and their parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker can bypass authentication using the path manipulation described above.
* **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `orderBy` which is passed to `OrderUtil`.
*   The `orderUtil.orderBy` is used directly in the SQL query within `mybatis/mapper/ProductOrderMapper.xml`.
*   The `select()` method in `com/xq/tmall/dao/ProductOrderMapper.java` allows control of `orderUtil.orderBy`.
*   The `getList()` method in `com/xq/tmall/service/impl/ProductOrderServiceImpl.java` calls `select()`.
*   The `getList()` method in `com/xq/tmall/controller/admin/OrderController.java` receives the `orderBy` parameter from the HTTP request.
*   The authentication filter bypasses the verification for URLs containing `/admin/login` or `/admin/account`.

**Exploitation Example:**

The provided `sqlmap` command shows a typical exploitation attempt:

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://10.0.0.5:8080/admin/login/../../tmall/admin/order/1/1?orderBy=1" -dbs -v 3
```

This command uses `sqlmap` to target the vulnerable endpoint and attempt to enumerate database names by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. The bypass is achieved using `/admin/login/../../tmall` part in the URL, which allows unauthorized access to the backend endpoint `/tmall/admin/order/1/1`

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes detailed code analysis and screenshots explaining how the `orderBy` parameter makes its way from HTTP request to the vulnerable SQL query.
* It also highlights how to bypass authentication using a specific URL format.

This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access and SQL injection, potentially leading to a severe security breach.
