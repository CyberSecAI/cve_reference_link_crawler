- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing origin verification in a `postMessage` handler. Specifically, the `message` event listener in `editor-sdk.js` does not validate the origin of the received messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of origin validation in the `postMessage` handler, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The vulnerable code is in the `editor-sdk.js` file and it affects how the application handles messages from other origins.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user authenticated to Squidex by tricking them into visiting a malicious website. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can embed the vulnerable `editor-editorjs.html` page in an iframe on a malicious website. Then, the attacker can send a crafted `postMessage` to the iframe, triggering the XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the `editor.render` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and trick a user into visiting it. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the server running Squidex. The attack complexity is low as no additional preconditions are required. User interaction is required as the user needs to visit the attacker's website, which contains the malicious iframe and triggers the XSS in the context of the vulnerable Squidex application.
