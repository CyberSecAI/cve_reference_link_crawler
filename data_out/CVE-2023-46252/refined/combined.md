# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via postMessage Handler

## Description

### Summary

The missing origin verification in a postMessage handler introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Details

The [editor-sdk.js](https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/backend/src/Squidex/wwwroot/scripts/editor-sdk.js) file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: `SquidexSidebar`, `SquidexWidget`, and `SquidexFormField`.

```
function SquidexFormField() {
  // ...
 window.addEventListener('message', eventListener, false);
}
```

The registered event listener takes some action based on the `type` of the received message. For example, when the `SquidexFormField` receives a message with the `type` `valueChanged`, the `value` property is updated, and the function `raiseValueChanged` is called:

```
    function eventListener(event) {
        if (event.source !== window) {
            var type = event.data.type;
            console.log('Received Message: ' + type);
            if (...) {
                // ...
            } else if (type === 'valueChanged') {
                value = event.data.value;
                raiseValueChanged();
            }
     // ...
```

The `raiseValueChanged` function invokes the `valueHandler` callback function, if defined:

```
    function raiseValueChanged() {
        if (valueHandler) {
            valueHandler(value);
        }
    }
```

This callback function can be registered via the `onValueChanged` function:

```
        /**
     * Register an function that is called whenever the value of the field has changed.
     *
     * @param {function} callback: The callback to invoke. Argument 1: Field value (any).
     */
        onValueChanged: function (callback) {
            if (!isFunction(callback)) {
                return;
            }
            valueHandler = callback;
            raiseValueChanged();
        },
```

The `SquidexFormField` class is for example used in the [editor-editorjs.html](https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/backend/src/Squidex/wwwroot/scripts/editor-editorjs.html) file, which can be accessed via the public `wwwroot` folder. It uses the `onValueChanged` method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the `editor.render` function:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
...
    <script>
        var field = new SquidexFormField();
        var editor = new EditorJS({
            ...
            onReady: function () {
                field.onValueChanged(function (value) {
                    if (value) {
                        editor.render(value);
                    }
                });
                ...
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `editor.render` function used here is part of the [editorjs npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40editorjs/editorjs). Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Since the registered message event listener in [editor-sdk.js](https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/backend/src/Squidex/wwwroot/scripts/editor-sdk.js) does not verify the origin of the received message, an attacker can include the [editor-editorjs.html](https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/blob/master/backend/src/Squidex/wwwroot/scripts/editor-editorjs.html) page in an iframe and send a message to it in order to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

Please note that this is just one example of turning this into an XSS vulnerability. The root cause of this vulnerability is the missing origin checks of the message event listeners.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user authenticated to Squidex by tricking them into visiting a malicious website.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
