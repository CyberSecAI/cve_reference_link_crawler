### Description

An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system.

The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password.

This issue impacts:

GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux.

GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux.

GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux.

This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| GlobalProtect App 5.3 | < 5.3.2 on Linux | >= 5.3.2 on Linux |
| GlobalProtect App 5.2 | <= 5.2.7 on Linux | None |
| GlobalProtect App 5.1 | < 5.1.10 on Linux | >= 5.1.10 on Linux |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only to GlobalProtect app users that save their user credentials for use when authenticating to a GlobalProtect portal.

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
4.7 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:
