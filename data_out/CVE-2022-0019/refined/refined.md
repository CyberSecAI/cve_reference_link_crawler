- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux insufficiently protects the hashed credentials of users who have saved their passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application stores hashed credentials in a way that makes them accessible to other local users on the system. This is due to insufficient protection of the credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can use the exposed hashed credentials to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without needing the plaintext password.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected Linux system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable GlobalProtect app is installed and a user has saved their credentials through the GlobalProtect app.
