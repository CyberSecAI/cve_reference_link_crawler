## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode <= 1.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wpdev-paypal-button
2. For the "Business/Product Name" enter the payload `"><script>alert(2)</script>`
3. Save and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
