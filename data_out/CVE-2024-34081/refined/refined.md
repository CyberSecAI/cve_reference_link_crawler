Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Improper escaping of custom field names in MantisBT. The application was using `lang_get_defaulted` to retrieve the custom field name, which did not sanitize HTML, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript into a custom field name, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers when they view affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** If Content Security Policy (CSP) settings allow, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Potential Account Takeover:** XSS can lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim, including session hijacking or account compromise.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data displayed on the page, especially if the victim has higher privileges.
- **Page Manipulation:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the page or redirect the victim to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript into a custom field name. This could be done when creating or updating a custom field.
-  The malicious code is triggered when the custom field name is displayed in the following locations:
    - When resolving or closing issues (`bug_change_status_page.php`) related to a project that uses said custom field.
    - When viewing issues (`view_all_bug_page.php`) and the custom field is selected as a display column.
    - When printing issues (`print_all_bug_page.php`) and the custom field is selected as a display column.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged Account:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to create or edit custom fields. This likely requires administrative or project management level access.
- **Knowledge of MantisBT:**  The attacker needs to be familiar with how MantisBT uses custom fields and how they are displayed in various pages.
- **No User Interaction:**  Once the malicious custom field name is saved, the attack happens automatically when other users access the vulnerable pages, requiring no direct interaction with the attacker.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The fix involves replacing `lang_get_defaulted` with `string_attribute` to properly escape HTML in custom field names.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-25830, which affected a different page, highlighting a recurring pattern of improper escaping.
-  The issue was also present when exporting to excel format where some special characters in custom field names would lead to errors when opening the file. This was addressed in a separate issue.
-  The initial fix was applied to `bug_change_status_page.php` and `core/print_api.php`. `print_api.php` was fixed by sanitizing the output of `print_link()` at a lower level.

In summary, CVE-2024-34081 is a stored XSS vulnerability arising from improper handling of custom field names in MantisBT. It allows an attacker with sufficient privileges to inject malicious scripts that execute when other users view affected pages.
