# Cross-site scripting in Custom Field name

Moderate

[dregad](/dregad)
published
GHSA-wgx7-jp56-65mq
May 12, 2024

## Package

composer

mantisbt
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 2.26.2

## Patched versions

2.26.2

## Description

Improper escaping of a custom field's name allows an attacker to inject HTML and, if CSP settings permit, achieve execution of arbitrary JavaScript when:

* resolving or closing issues (bug\_change\_status\_page.php) belonging to a project linking said custom field
* viewing issues (view\_all\_bug\_page.php) when the custom field is displayed as a column
* printing issues (print\_all\_bug\_page.php) when the custom field is displayed as a column

### Impact

Cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Patches

[447a521](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/447a521aae0f82f791b8116a14a20e276df739be)

### Workarounds

Ensure Custom Field Names do not contain HTML tags.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
