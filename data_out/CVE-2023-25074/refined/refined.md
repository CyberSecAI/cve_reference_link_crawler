- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege validation in the Command Centre Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Authenticated unprivileged operators can modify and view Competencies due to the improper privilege validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can modify and view competencies, which may lead to unauthorized access or other security compromises. The impact also includes a potential loss of integrity, and a low impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack. Requires an attacker to have valid credentials to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the Command Centre Server.
