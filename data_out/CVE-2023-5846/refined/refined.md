- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Franklin Fueling System TS-550 uses password hashes with insufficient computational effort, making them easily decodable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decode admin credentials, gaining unauthenticated access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity. Public exploits are available.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific attacker capabilities or position are mentioned other than remote access. The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction.
