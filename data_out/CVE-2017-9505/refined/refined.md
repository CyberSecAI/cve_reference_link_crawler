{
  "CVE-2017-9505": {
    "Description": "Confluence did not check if a user had permission to view a page when creating a workbox notification about new comments. An attacker who can login to Confluence could receive workbox notifications, which contain the content of comments, for comments added to a page after they started watching it even if they do not have permission to view the page itself.",
    "Root cause": "Missing permission check when creating workbox notifications for new comments.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could receive workbox notifications containing the content of comments added to a page even if they do not have permission to view the page itself.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be logged into Confluence and must be watching a page that they do not have permission to view.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a valid Confluence user who can log in, and must start watching the restricted page before comments are added."
