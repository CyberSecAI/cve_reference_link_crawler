### Description

Confluence did not check if a user had permission to view a page when creating a workbox notification about new comments. An attacker who can login to Confluence could receive workbox notifications, which contain the content of comments, for comments added to a page after they started watching it even if they do not have permission to view the page itself.

**Affected versions:**

* Versions of Confluence starting with 4.3.0 before 6.2.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fix:**

* **Confluence** Server 6.2.1 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download>.

**Workaround**

If you are unable to upgrade to the fixed version or newer and need a workaround, you will need to disable in-app notifications from workbox as per the instructions [found here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-workbox-notifications-301663830.html):

1. Navigate to ![](https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/590259974/Cog.png) > **General Configuration**
2. Choose In-app Notifications in the left-hand panel
3. Select **does not provide in-app notifications**.
4. The workbox icon ![](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf61/files/877187111/877187147/1/1489126934141/WorkboxIcon.png) will disappear from the Confluence top menu bar.

**Acknowledgements**

Atlassian would like to credit Mathias Frank of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab for reporting this issue to us.

# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.
