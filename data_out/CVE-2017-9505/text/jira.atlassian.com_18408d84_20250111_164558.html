### Description

Confluence did not check if a user had permission to view a page when creating a workbox notification about new comments. An attacker who can login to Confluence could receive workbox notifications, which contain the content of comments, for comments added to a page after they started watching it even if they do not have permission to view the page itself.

**Affected versions:**

* Versions of Confluence starting with 4.3.0 before 6.2.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fix:**

* **Confluence** Server 6.2.1 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download>.

**Workaround**

If you are unable to upgrade to the fixed version or newer and need a workaround, you will need to disable in-app notifications from workbox as per the instructions [found here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-workbox-notifications-301663830.html):

1. Navigate to ![](https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/590259974/Cog.png) > **General Configuration**
2. Choose In-app Notifications in the left-hand panel
3. Select **does not provide in-app notifications**.
4. The workbox icon ![](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf61/files/877187111/877187147/1/1489126934141/WorkboxIcon.png) will disappear from the Confluence top menu bar.

Atlassian would like to credit Mathias Frank of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab for reporting this issue to us.
