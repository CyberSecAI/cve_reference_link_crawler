Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-25189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A design flaw in Nokia's Base Transceiver Station (BTS) implementation causes the BTS to send SSH command logs, containing details of Nokia Care service personnel's performed operations, to the network operator's Element Management (EM) GUI admin interface during maintenance windows when SSH access is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability allows network operator personnel to access logs of Nokia Care services' SSH operations which is not intended functionality of the product.
-  The BTS transmits sensitive service operation logs via an interface not intended for this type of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of Nokia Care service personnelâ€™s actions.
- Network operators gain access to details of performed maintenance activities, which is not a productized feature.
- Unauthorized visibility of BTS service operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the internal management network of the mobile network solution when SSH access to the BTS is enabled during a maintenance window.
- Access to the information is gained through the Element Management (EM) GUI which is used by the network operator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a mobile network operator personnel with access to the Element Management (EM) GUI.
- They must also have the ability to enable SSH access to the BTS for maintenance, which is a standard operational task during maintenance windows.
- The attacker must be on the internal management network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is limited to the internal management network of the mobile network solution and is not exploitable from external sources like user devices, roaming networks or the internet.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Nokia Single RAN 24R1 onwards.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lena David and Geoffrey Bertoli from Synacktiv.
