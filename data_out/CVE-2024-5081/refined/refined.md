- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP eMember plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in certain areas and fails to sanitize and escape user inputs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Stored XSS:** The plugin is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of sanitization and escaping.
    - **CSRF:** The absence of CSRF protection allows attackers to manipulate logged-in administrators.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to:
    - Account takeover
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious activities
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a crafted payload to the vulnerable plugin settings page.
    - The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into opening the HTML page, triggering the form submission.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft HTML.
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to open a malicious HTML page.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the wordpress site.
