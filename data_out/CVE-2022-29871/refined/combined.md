Intel® CSME software installer before version 2306.4.10.0. Intel® CSME, Intel® AMT and Intel® Standard Manageability before versions 3.1.94, 4.0.48, 11.12.94, 11.22.94, 11.8.94, 12.0.93, 13.0.65, 13.30.35, 13.50.25, 14.1.70, 14.5.50, 15.0.45, and 16.1.27.

### Recommendation:

Intel recommends that users of Intel® Converged Security Management Engine (CSME), Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability software update to the latest version provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.

### Acknowledgements:

CVE-2022-29871 was found externally. CVE-2022-38102 and CVE-2022-36392 were found internally by Intel employees.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
