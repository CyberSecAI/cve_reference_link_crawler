Pickle serializer is not secure and may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If attacker gains access to cache storage (filesystem, memcached, redis) then he can craft special payload, poison the cache and execute python-code. To avoid the attack we can use a safer serializer (eg. JSON).

I‚Äôve added possibility to use any serializer. All changes are backward compatible and default serializer is pickle.

| Would it make sense to encode bytes in base64 (or something else) with JSON? Having bytes in an object is a relatively common case and JSON can't serialize bytes. If you look at the example below, `cls=BytesEncoder` and `object_hook=as_bytes` could be passed to `json.dumps` and `json.loads` respectively as defaults.  ``` import json from base64 import b64decode, b64encode  BYTES_HINT = "__bytes__"   class BytesEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):     def default(self, obj):         if isinstance(obj, (bytes, bytearray)):             return {BYTES_HINT: True, "bytes": b64encode(obj).decode("ascii")}         return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)   def as_bytes(obj):     if BYTES_HINT in obj:         return b64decode(obj["bytes"])     else:         return obj   test_data = dict() test_data["float"] = 1.5 test_data["bytes"] = b"bytes" test_data["nested_dict"] = {"1": 1, "2": b"dict_bytes"} test_data["list"] = [True, "string", b"list_bytes", None] print(test_data)  jsonstring = json.dumps(test_data, cls=BytesEncoder) assert test_data == json.loads(jsonstring, object_hook=as_bytes)   ``` |

| 1. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfake responsibility‚Äù that library is responsive for serializing types unsupported by json. We can‚Äôt cover all the cases and shouldn‚Äôt try. 2. Explicit is better than implicit. This may lead to unexpected behavior by developer and requires strong input validation. For example, application can cache user-provided (or third party) data that may contain special keys (‚Äú**bytes**‚Äù: True).   All in all, it‚Äôs developer‚Äôs responsibility, not library‚Äôs one. |

| I see 2 options for supporting bytes:   1. Low level. Add some flag (e.g. raw=True) to get/set methods, that allows to bypass serialization. 2. High level. Add decorator (e.g. memoize\_bytes) with auto base64 encoding/decoding. |

| Explicit is better than implicit. This may lead to unexpected behavior by developer and requires strong input validation. For example, application can cache user-provided (or third party) data that may contain special keys (‚Äúbytes‚Äù: True).  Just to point out that `bytes` isn't really the special key in the example. I tried to show that with `test_data["bytes"] = b"bytes"`  The special key was`__bytes__`and if needed you could use something more specific like `__flask_caching_bytes_hint__`.  Here's an example that's even more clear showing that having `bytes` as a key doesn't break things. That key could be almost anything and it shouldn't matter:  ``` test_data = {'bytes': True} jsonstring = json.dumps(test_data, cls=BytesEncoder) assert test_data == json.loads(jsonstring, object_hook=as_bytes)  ``` |

| Pylibmc also uses pickle by default. [@sh4nks](https://github.com/sh4nks) maybe we should force (de-)serialize data on our own?  <https://github.com/lericson/pylibmc/blob/8e783a69cc69fb04b9faad6c61ab43193569ab0f/src/_pylibmcmodule.c#L1245-L1284> |

| As stated above, we consider the CVE invalid. You'll want to figure out how to mark those as invalid in whatever scanning tool is reporting them to you. Use of pickle on its own isn't a security issue, it would only be an issue if we were loading arbitrary data, which we're not.  This repo has recently changed maintainers, and the volunteer maintainers are still trying to find time to start working on various issues. There is a PR in cachelib to support serializer customization, and we will be transitioning flask-caching to use cachelib. |

| Once [#308](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/308) is merged, this will need some updates due to [cachelib:#63](https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/63)  I see only one way to update this according to changes - close the PR and open a new one :)  [@northernSage](https://github.com/northernSage) may be we can implement common serializers (json, pickle with hmac) in `cachelib`? Otherwise every library user will have to implement boilerplate serialization engines.  Note about severity: According to [Censys](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.service_name+%3D+%60REDIS%60+or+services.service_name+%3D+%60MEMCACHED%60), there are 300,000 memched/redis servers exposed to internet, but what about intranet?.. I hope they don't use pickle :). Sure, there isn't a real-time data and honeypots make some part of it. So we can endlessly discuss pickle (un-)security, but this still holds true - cache storages are not properly secured. The main goal of the CVE is to warn end users about this behaviour. I have decided for me to patch library, because I don't agree with this behaviour, but everyone decides for himself what to do. |

When I set the default serializer in `base.py` to `json`, many tests failed because they could not serialize bytes to str.

I fixed it with the following, which I think should be included if this BytesSerializer is to work with the JSON serializer properly: [NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json@591f89e#diff-67f94315529cee25fa3dc7c13b27c29fdf9c96fd765156090247b49d587ba08cR16-R17](https://github.com/NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json/commit/591f89e4f09e90aad25b7027672d342c41349426#diff-67f94315529cee25fa3dc7c13b27c29fdf9c96fd765156090247b49d587ba08cR16-R17)

```
    def dumps(self, obj, *args, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(obj, bytes):
            obj = obj.decode("UTF-8")
        result = self._serializer.dumps(obj, *args, **kwargs)
        if isinstance(result, str):
            return result.encode()
        return result

| The issue isn't about memoization, it's about the deserialization from the cache, due to its use of Pickle. See <https://security.stackexchange.com/a/201243/5176> for an example of such an attack.  For an attack like this to work, an attacker must:   1. Be able to write arbitrary values to the cache 2. Be able to generate a cache key that will collide with a value being read by the application 3. Cause the application to read a maliciously-injected value   Any situation where all 3 of those is true is a situation where the application has larger problems; for example, if someone's able to inject malicious cached rendered pages into a Flask app's cache, then they can make the website say literally anything they want, regardless of whether it involves the execution of remote code. Basically, the Pickle vulnerability follows from a website *already* being extremely vulnerable (due to conditions 1 and 2 being met).  Remote code execution is definitely a bad thing, but in any situation where RCE can be triggered through this (extremely theoretical) vulnerability, there's already bigger problems with the website. |

| I just submitted an update request to mitre.org with the following description:  The stated vulnerability is not a vulnerability in flask-caching itself, but only makes flask-caching one intermediate member in a chain of multiple security issues.  For an attack like this to work, an attacker must:   1. Be able to write arbitrary values to the cache 2. Be able to generate a cache key that will collide with a value being read by the application 3.

Basically, the Pickle vulnerability follows from a website already being extremely vulnerable (due to conditions 1 and 2 being met).  There has not been a single confirmed case of this exploit having ever occurred, despite the description being public for two years; the attack is only theoretical, requires a very specific exploit path which requires there to be much worse security issues to be visible in the first place, and it boils down to "if you let people upload code to your server, they can run it."  This CVE should be rejected, or at least have its severity reduced, with the following base metrics:  Attack complexity: high (requires multiple failures in security infrastructure) User interaction: required (the exploit requires a web request that reads from a poisoned cache item) Confidentiality: none (this does not directly result in the disclosure of confidential data) Availability: none (it's regarding data in a cache, which is inherently transitory/non-durable) |

| Hi, are there any updates on how this pull request or the corresponding CVE will be handled in the library? Will other serializers (e.g. json) be offered as [@subnix](https://github.com/subnix) suggested?  I forked the repo and made a library extending this that replaces the serializers, though its been a while since I worked on it since we went with Next.js instead. I have no idea if it still works. I think it should even be able to serialize bytes to json, by base64 it... again no guarantees and no warranty... <https://github.com/NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json> |

### @subnix **[subnix](/subnix)** commented [Dec 31, 2020](#issue-777078228)

Pickle serializer is not secure and may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If attacker gains access to cache storage (filesystem, memcached, redis) then he can craft special payload, poison the cache and execute python-code. To avoid the attack we can use a safer serializer (eg. JSON).

I‚Äôve added possibility to use any serializer. All changes are backward compatible and default serializer is pickle.

| Would it make sense to encode bytes in base64 (or something else) with JSON? Having bytes in an object is a relatively common case and JSON can't serialize bytes. If you look at the example below, `cls=BytesEncoder` and `object_hook=as_bytes` could be passed to `json.dumps` and `json.loads` respectively as defaults.  ``` import json from base64 import b64decode, b64encode  BYTES_HINT = "__bytes__"   class BytesEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):     def default(self, obj):         if isinstance(obj, (bytes, bytearray)):             return {BYTES_HINT: True, "bytes": b64encode(obj).decode("ascii")}         return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)   def as_bytes(obj):     if BYTES_HINT in obj:         return b64decode(obj["bytes"])     else:         return obj   test_data = dict() test_data["float"] = 1.5 test_data["bytes"] = b"bytes" test_data["nested_dict"] = {"1": 1, "2": b"dict_bytes"} test_data["list"] = [True, "string", b"list_bytes", None] print(test_data)  jsonstring = json.dumps(test_data, cls=BytesEncoder) assert test_data == json.loads(jsonstring, object_hook=as_bytes)   ``` |

| 1. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfake responsibility‚Äù that library is responsive for serializing types unsupported by json. We can‚Äôt cover all the cases and shouldn‚Äôt try. 2. Explicit is better than implicit. This may lead to unexpected behavior by developer and requires strong input validation. For example, application can cache user-provided (or third party) data that may contain special keys (‚Äú**bytes**‚Äù: True).   All in all, it‚Äôs developer‚Äôs responsibility, not library‚Äôs one. |

| I see 2 options for supporting bytes:   1. Low level. Add some flag (e.g. raw=True) to get/set methods, that allows to bypass serialization. 2. High level. Add decorator (e.g. memoize\_bytes) with auto base64 encoding/decoding. |

| Explicit is better than implicit. This may lead to unexpected behavior by developer and requires strong input validation. For example, application can cache user-provided (or third party) data that may contain special keys (‚Äúbytes‚Äù: True).  Just to point out that `bytes` isn't really the special key in the example. I tried to show that with `test_data["bytes"] = b"bytes"`  The special key was`__bytes__`and if needed you could use something more specific like `__flask_caching_bytes_hint__`.  Here's an example that's even more clear showing that having `bytes` as a key doesn't break things. That key could be almost anything and it shouldn't matter:  ``` test_data = {'bytes': True} jsonstring = json.dumps(test_data, cls=BytesEncoder) assert test_data == json.loads(jsonstring, object_hook=as_bytes)  ``` |

| As stated above, we consider the CVE invalid. You'll want to figure out how to mark those as invalid in whatever scanning tool is reporting them to you. Use of pickle on its own isn't a security issue, it would only be an issue if we were loading arbitrary data, which we're not.  This repo has recently changed maintainers, and the volunteer maintainers are still trying to find time to start working on various issues. There is a PR in cachelib to support serializer customization, and we will be transitioning flask-caching to use cachelib. |

| Once [#308](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/308) is merged, this will need some updates due to [cachelib:#63](https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/63)  I see only one way to update this according to changes - close the PR and open a new one :)  [@northernSage](https://github.com/northernSage) may be we can implement common serializers (json, pickle with hmac) in `cachelib`? Otherwise every library user will have to implement boilerplate serialization engines.  Note about severity: According to [Censys](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.service_name+%3D+%60REDIS%60+or+services.service_name+%3D+%60MEMCACHED%60), there are 300,000 memched/redis servers exposed to internet, but what about intranet?.. I hope they don't use pickle :). Sure, there isn't a real-time data and honeypots make some part of it. So we can endlessly discuss pickle (un-)security, but this still holds true - cache storages are not properly secured. The main goal of the CVE is to warn end users about this behaviour. I have decided for me to patch library, because I don't agree with this behaviour, but everyone decides for himself what to do. |

When I set the default serializer in `base.py` to `json`, many tests failed because they could not serialize bytes to str.

I fixed it with the following, which I think should be included if this BytesSerializer is to work with the JSON serializer properly: [NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json@591f89e#diff-67f94315529cee25fa3dc7c13b27c29fdf9c96fd765156090247b49d587ba08cR16-R17](https://github.com/NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json/commit/591f89e4f09e90aad25b7027672d342c41349426#diff-67f94315529cee25fa3dc7c13b27c29fdf9c96fd765156090247b49d587ba08cR16-R17)

```
    def dumps(self, obj, *args, **kwargs):
        if isinstance(obj, bytes):
            obj = obj.decode("UTF-8")
        result = self._serializer.dumps(obj, *args, **kwargs)
        if isinstance(result, str):
            return result.encode()
        return result

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@shahwaizkhan](https://github.com/shahwaizkhan), [@rylyade1](https://github.com/rylyade1) We are currently going through an internal refactor process, please see [#308](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/308) mentioned in my previous comment:  Once [#308](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/308) is merged, this will need some updates due to [cachelib:#63](https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/63)  Bear in mind that cachelib (which is now flask-caching's backend) already supports custom/configurable serializers, what is left now is exposing this functionality in a convenient way through flask-caching's API, ongoing in [pallets-eco/cachelib#136 (comment)](https://github.com/pallets-eco/cachelib/issues/136#event-6610243105) |

| The issue isn't about memoization, it's about the deserialization from the cache, due to its use of Pickle. See <https://security.stackexchange.com/a/201243/5176> for an example of such an attack.  For an attack like this to work, an attacker must:   1. Be able to write arbitrary values to the cache 2. Be able to generate a cache key that will collide with a value being read by the application 3. Cause the application to read a maliciously-injected value   Any situation where all 3 of those is true is a situation where the application has larger problems; for example, if someone's able to inject malicious cached rendered pages into a Flask app's cache, then they can make the website say literally anything they want, regardless of whether it involves the execution of remote code. Basically, the Pickle vulnerability follows from a website *already* being extremely vulnerable (due to conditions 1 and 2 being met).  Remote code execution is definitely a bad thing, but in any situation where RCE can be triggered through this (extremely theoretical) vulnerability, there's already bigger problems with the website. |

| This is not really urgent nor an actual vulnerability. The ONLY case where this can be exploited is if your infrastructure is already compromised and an attacker can write arbitrary data to your cache backend. Please see the comment right above yours as well. |

| I just submitted an update request to mitre.org with the following description:  The stated vulnerability is not a vulnerability in flask-caching itself, but only makes flask-caching one intermediate member in a chain of multiple security issues.  For an attack like this to work, an attacker must:   1. Be able to write arbitrary values to the cache 2. Be able to generate a cache key that will collide with a value being read by the application 3. Cause the application to read a maliciously-injected value   Any situation where all 3 of those is true is a situation where the application has larger problems; for example, if someone's able to inject malicious cached rendered pages into a Flask app's cache, then they can make the website say literally anything they want, regardless of whether it involves the execution of remote code. Basically, the Pickle vulnerability follows from a website already being extremely vulnerable (due to conditions 1 and 2 being met).  There has not been a single confirmed case of this exploit having ever occurred, despite the description being public for two years; the attack is only theoretical, requires a very specific exploit path which requires there to be much worse security issues to be visible in the first place, and it boils down to "if you let people upload code to your server, they can run it."  This CVE should be rejected, or at least have its severity reduced, with the following base metrics:  Attack complexity: high (requires multiple failures in security infrastructure) User interaction: required (the exploit requires a web request that reads from a poisoned cache item) Confidentiality: none (this does not directly result in the disclosure of confidential data) Availability: none (it's regarding data in a cache, which is inherently transitory/non-durable) |

Will other serializers (e.g. json) be offered as [@subnix](https://github.com/subnix) suggested?  I forked the repo and made a library extending this that replaces the serializers, though its been a while since I worked on it since we went with Next.js instead. I have no idea if it still works. I think it should even be able to serialize bytes to json, by base64 it... again no guarantees and no warranty... <https://github.com/NotoriousPyro/flask-caching-json> |
