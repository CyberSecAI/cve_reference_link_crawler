{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `flask-caching` library uses the `pickle` serializer by default, which is known to be insecure and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or local privilege escalation if an attacker can control the data being deserialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of an insecure deserialization method (pickle)",
       "Lack of proper input sanitization before deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who gains access to the cache storage (filesystem, memcached, redis) can craft malicious pickle payloads, poison the cache, and execute arbitrary python code on the server when the application retrieves and deserializes the poisoned data.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to gain write access to the cache storage used by `flask-caching` and be able to generate a cache key to overwrite an existing or frequently used cached value. The application must then attempt to read the poisoned entry, which triggers the deserialization and code execution.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to write to the cache storage and the ability to cause the application to read the malicious entry. This often implies an already compromised system or an application with insufficient access controls on its cache."
