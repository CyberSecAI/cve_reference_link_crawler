- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embedded. Specifically, the `headingURL` field in the "Ultimate post Heading" block is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a post, which will be executed when a user views the affected page. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites, stealing cookies, or performing other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious payload in the `headingURL` field of a "Ultimate post Heading" block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least Contributor role to create or edit posts and add the vulnerable block.
