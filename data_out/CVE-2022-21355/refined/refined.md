Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-21355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the processing of Data Node jobs in Oracle MySQL Cluster. This inadequate validation leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer, due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. This exposure occurs because the out-of-bounds read allows the attacker to access memory they shouldn't, which could contain sensitive data.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While this vulnerability by itself does not provide arbitrary code execution, the advisory notes that an attacker can combine this flaw with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the service account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **Data Node Jobs:** The specific area of exploitation is the processing of Data Node jobs within MySQL Cluster.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require local access to the system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not needed to exploit the vulnerability, enabling any remote attacker to potentially trigger this flaw.
*   **Knowledge of Data Node Jobs:** The attacker needs some knowledge about how Data Node jobs are processed to craft a malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of MySQL Cluster (7.4.34 and prior, 7.5.24 and prior, 7.6.20 and prior, 8.0.27 and prior).
*   Oracle has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is also present in some NetApp products that incorporate MySQL server and is addressed in their advisory NTAP-20220121-0008.
*   The ZDI advisory (ZDI-22-124) indicates this vulnerability can be combined with others for arbitrary code execution.
