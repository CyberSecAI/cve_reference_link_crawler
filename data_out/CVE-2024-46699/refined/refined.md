The provided content relates to CVE-2024-46699.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing preemption disabling around the `write_seqcount_begin/end()` pair while updating GPU statistics in the `v3d_sched.c` driver. This oversight leads to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** The lack of preemption disabling allows other processes or threads to interrupt the sequence of operations within the `write_seqcount_begin/end()` block.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel panic:** The race condition can trigger an assertion failure leading to a kernel panic, causing system instability. The provided logs demonstrate a warning and a call trace leading to this issue.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation would require triggering the code path related to GPU statistics update in the `v3d_sched.c` driver, specifically during job starts and updates. This can be done by scheduling jobs on the V3D GPU.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to trigger GPU workloads that would cause the vulnerable code in the v3d driver to be executed. This typically would require a user with some level of access to graphics or other hardware features.

The fix adds `preempt_disable()` and `preempt_enable()` around the sequence lock operations in `v3d_job_start_stats` and `v3d_job_update_stats`.
