Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-39152:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Gradle Plugin incorrectly invokes APIs that are only available on the Jenkins controller from an agent during the setup of build log annotations. This leads to an exception.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper control flow in the Gradle Plugin.
- Failure to handle exceptions properly which prevents credentials from being masked in build logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Credentials may not be masked (i.e., replaced with asterisks) in the build log in certain situations. This could expose sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker who can trigger a build process using the Gradle plugin may be able to cause credentials to be exposed in the build logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger builds with the affected Gradle Plugin. This likely requires having at least the ability to create/modify/trigger builds in Jenkins.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue occurs in Gradle Plugin versions 2.8 and earlier.
- Gradle Plugin 2.8.1 addresses this issue.
- An improvement in Pipeline: API 1232.v1679fa\_2f0f76 prevents similar credential masking issues from affecting other plugins in the future.
