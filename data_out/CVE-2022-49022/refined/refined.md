Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-49022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability exists within the `ieee80211_get_rate_duration` function in the mac80211 subsystem of the Linux kernel. This occurs when the index `idx` used to access the `duration` array within `airtime_mcs_groups` exceeds the bounds of the array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is an array-index-out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code doesn't properly check the value of `idx` against the size of the `duration` array leading to a potential access beyond the array's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to a crash due to a read of invalid memory. The provided UBSAN report highlights this with an "array-index-out-of-bounds" error. While the provided information suggests a crash due to out-of-bounds access, it doesn't give information on other possible consequences like information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the `ieee80211_get_rate_duration` function with specific parameters that lead to an out-of-bounds `idx` value. This function is involved in calculating airtime for WiFi transmissions. The vulnerability can be triggered during the processing of received WiFi status data, specifically within the `mt76u_tx_status_data` worker thread.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to influence or craft specific WiFi frames that result in the vulnerable code path being executed with an out-of-range `idx` value. This might involve techniques related to manipulating the encoding or stream counts in the received WiFi status. The attacker would need to be in a position to transmit or interact with a WiFi device running a vulnerable kernel.
