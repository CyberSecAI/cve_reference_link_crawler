Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10350:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes mentions of CVE-2017-10350 within the context of security advisories related to OpenJDK, IBM Java, and Oracle Java. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   * **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
      - Unbounded memory allocation in `JAXWSExceptionBase` deserialization within OpenJDK.
   * **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
      - Unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data can lead to excessive memory allocation.
   * **Impact of Exploitation:**
      -  Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption and possible program crash.
      - In some cases, unauthorized reading or modification of data accessible to the Java process is mentioned.
   * **Attack Vectors:**
      - By supplying a specially crafted serialized Java object, triggering the vulnerable deserialization.
      - Through an application using JAX-WS and processing an attacker-provided payload that is deserialized by `JAXWSExceptionBase`.
   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - An attacker needs to be able to supply malicious serialized data to a vulnerable application using `JAXWSExceptionBase`, this could be done remotely, either directly or by way of a vulnerable application acting on an attackers behalf.

**Additional Details from Content:**

   - Some of the resources specifically mention the affected component as `JAX-WS`.
   - The `security.netapp.com` content provides CVSS v3 scores (5.3 MEDIUM) and the attack vector as Network, requiring no special privileges and no user interaction for exploitation.
   - The advisories generally recommend upgrading to the latest version of the affected software to remediate the vulnerability.

**Summary**

CVE-2017-10350 arises from a deserialization vulnerability within the JAX-WS component of Java. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying specially crafted serialized data that triggers unbounded memory allocation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity and the attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious data to the vulnerable application.
