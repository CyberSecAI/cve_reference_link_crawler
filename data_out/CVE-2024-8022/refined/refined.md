{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the \"Phone Number\" parameter when updating user settings in the Genexis Tilgin Home Gateway.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the \"Phone Number\" field. When other users access the affected page, the script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:\n  - Theft of sensitive information (cookies, session tokens, user credentials)\n  - Account hijacking or identity theft\n  - Manipulation of site content\n  - Malware distribution\n  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of users",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a vulnerable input field, specifically the \"Phone Number\" parameter in the user settings configuration page, accessible via the web interface of the Genexis Tilgin Home Gateway.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the Genexis Tilgin Home Gateway and be able to navigate to the user settings page to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable \"Phone Number\" field. The attacker must also be able to log in to the web interface."
