# CVE-2024-38816: Path traversal vulnerability in functional web frameworks

HIGH | SEPTEMBER 12, 2024 | CVE-2024-38816
# Description

Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests and obtain any file on the file system that is also accessible to the process in which the Spring application is running.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when both of the following are true:

* the web application uses `RouterFunctions` to serve static resources
* resource handling is explicitly configured with a `FileSystemResource` location

However, malicious requests are blocked and rejected when any of the following is true:

* the [Spring Security HTTP Firewall](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/firewall.html) is in use
* the application runs on Tomcat or Jetty

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

Spring Framework

* 5.3.0 - 5.3.39
* 6.0.0 - 6.0.23
* 6.1.0 - 6.1.12
* Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

| Affected version(s) | Fix version | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.3.x | 5.3.40 | Commercial |
| 6.0.x | 6.0.24 | Commercial |
| 6.1.x | 6.1.13 | OSS |

No other mitigation steps are necessary.

Users of older, unsupported versions could enable Spring Security's Firewall in their application, or switch to using Tomcat or Jetty as a Web server because they reject such malicious requests.
