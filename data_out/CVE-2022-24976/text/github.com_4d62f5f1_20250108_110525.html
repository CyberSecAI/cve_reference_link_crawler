    …

   ```
   Some very old gits do not support this; it was added in 2.13.0 (2017).

   We already sort of detect broken submodules in the configure script,
   so this should be safe to remove. Unless the user deliberately
   corrupts their repository, there's no difference.
   ```

   This makes life easier for people who want to package snapshots
   of a git branch. They must provide their own serno.h in this
   case, containing also, perhaps, the date the snapshot was
   downloaded or such.

1. [configure: put directory macros in a header file, not in CPPFLAGS](/atheme/atheme/commit/4ed15d3c4262914902f2d0208ac388d17c58ab28)
    …

   ```
   This will be necessary for my near-future intention to change the contrib
   modules repository to be self-building; i.e. to have its own configure
   script and build system.

   Also don't try to expand directories like MODDIR for pretty printing,
   because it sometimes doesn't work depending on the directory arguments
   given to ./configure. Yeah, the config output looks worse, but oh well.
   ```

   Having to duplicate configure tests in all supported Atheme release and
   development branches, to enable contrib modules to be built reliably on
   all of our supported platforms, was quickly becoming untenable.

### Commits on Jan 30, 2022

1. [modules/saslserv/main: backport 7.3 commits for pending EID login](/atheme/atheme/commit/de2ba3ca8f6c39b41431d989f3ac66002a487839)
    …

   ```
   This backports commits [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52) & [ceb0235](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/ceb0235695e6736ce2abe86d0fe665be9e0f283c)
   from the master branch.

   The IRCv3.1 SASL specification contains the following wording:

       If the client completes registration (with CAP END, NICK, USER
       and any other necessary messages) while the SASL authentication
       is still in progress, the server SHOULD abort it and send a 906
       numeric, then register the client without authentication.

   We were relying on this behaviour (which was our mistake; it's a
   SHOULD, not a MUST), which turned out to be implemented in every
   IRC server daemon (that supports SASL) that we are aware of. This
   means that if someone completes registration without having completed
   an SASL negotiation, the SASL session would be aborted before the
   client is introduced to the network. At that point, the session would
   not exist and the client would not be logged in.

   The InspIRCd developers changed this behaviour in the
   [inspircd/inspircd@407b2e004cf66e442771](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/407b2e004cf66e442771) commit. It no longer aborts
   negotiation when a client prematurely completes registration.

   This means that if the client is attempting a multi-step (challenge-
   response) authentication mechanism, and that mechanism caches user
   credentials at some point before completion, the client can pre-
   maturely end negotiation and get logged in as that user.

   Worse still, SASL impersonation lets the attacker set the authzid to
   their intended victim, allowing them to login as anyone, even if they
   don't have a challenge-response authentication credential configured.
   This does not exist in version 7.1; the victim's account there has to
   have such a credential to be vulnerable to this attack.

   Vulnerable configurations are as follows:

   - All of:
     - InspIRCd 3+
     - Any of:
       - Atheme 7.1 (any version)
       - Atheme 7.2 (any version before 7.2.12; this commit)
       - Atheme 7.3 (any version before commit [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52))
     - Any of:
       - The saslserv/scram module is loaded
       - The saslserv/ecdh-x25519-challenge module is loaded
       - The saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge module is loaded

   This is a fix for a security vulnerability. The master (7.3) branch
   was already fixed in [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52), but the scope of the
   problem was not fully known at that time. The 7.1 branch is no longer
   supported, is not receiving security updates, and will not be patched;
   users of the 7.1 series (using an IRCd that does not abort the SASL
   session when the client prematurely completes registration) must
   upgrade, or unload the `saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge` module.

   This problem was discovered by and reported by [@edk0](https://github.com/edk0).
