    …

   ```
   Some very old gits do not support this; it was added in 2.13.0 (2017).

   We already sort of detect broken submodules in the configure script,
   so this should be safe to remove. Unless the user deliberately
   corrupts their repository, there's no difference.
   ```

   This makes life easier for people who want to package snapshots
   of a git branch. They must provide their own serno.h in this
   case, containing also, perhaps, the date the snapshot was
   downloaded or such.

1. [configure: put directory macros in a header file, not in CPPFLAGS](/atheme/atheme/commit/4ed15d3c4262914902f2d0208ac388d17c58ab28)
    …

   ```
   This will be necessary for my near-future intention to change the contrib
   modules repository to be self-building; i.e. to have its own configure
   script and build system.

   Also don't try to expand directories like MODDIR for pretty printing,
   because it sometimes doesn't work depending on the directory arguments
   given to ./configure. Yeah, the config output looks worse, but oh well.
   ```

   Having to duplicate configure tests in all supported Atheme release and
   development branches, to enable contrib modules to be built reliably on
   all of our supported platforms, was quickly becoming untenable.

### Commits on Jan 30, 2022

1. [modules/saslserv/main: backport 7.3 commits for pending EID login](/atheme/atheme/commit/de2ba3ca8f6c39b41431d989f3ac66002a487839)
    …

   ```
   This backports commits [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52) & [ceb0235](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/ceb0235695e6736ce2abe86d0fe665be9e0f283c)
   from the master branch.

   The IRCv3.1 SASL specification contains the following wording:

       If the client completes registration (with CAP END, NICK, USER
       and any other necessary messages) while the SASL authentication
       is still in progress, the server SHOULD abort it and send a 906
       numeric, then register the client without authentication.

   We were relying on this behaviour (which was our mistake; it's a
   SHOULD, not a MUST), which turned out to be implemented in every
   IRC server daemon (that supports SASL) that we are aware of. This
   means that if someone completes registration without having completed
   an SASL negotiation, the SASL session would be aborted before the
   client is introduced to the network. At that point, the session would
   not exist and the client would not be logged in.

   The InspIRCd developers changed this behaviour in the
   [inspircd/inspircd@407b2e004cf66e442771](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/407b2e004cf66e442771) commit. It no longer aborts
   negotiation when a client prematurely completes registration.

   This means that if the client is attempting a multi-step (challenge-
   response) authentication mechanism, and that mechanism caches user
   credentials at some point before completion, the client can pre-
   maturely end negotiation and get logged in as that user.

   Worse still, SASL impersonation lets the attacker set the authzid to
   their intended victim, allowing them to login as anyone, even if they
   don't have a challenge-response authentication credential configured.
   This does not exist in version 7.1; the victim's account there has to
   have such a credential to be vulnerable to this attack.

   Vulnerable configurations are as follows:

   - All of:
     - InspIRCd 3+
     - Any of:
       - Atheme 7.1 (any version)
       - Atheme 7.2 (any version before 7.2.12; this commit)
       - Atheme 7.3 (any version before commit [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52))
     - Any of:
       - The saslserv/scram module is loaded
       - The saslserv/ecdh-x25519-challenge module is loaded
       - The saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge module is loaded

   This is a fix for a security vulnerability. The master (7.3) branch
   was already fixed in [4e664c7](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/4e664c75d0b280a052eb8b5e81aa41944e593c52), but the scope of the
   problem was not fully known at that time. The 7.1 branch is no longer
   supported, is not receiving security updates, and will not be patched;
   users of the 7.1 series (using an IRCd that does not abort the SASL
   session when the client prematurely completes registration) must
   upgrade, or unload the `saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge` module.

   This problem was discovered by and reported by [@edk0](https://github.com/edk0).

Subject: General authentication bypass in Atheme IRC services with InspIRCd 3

Hi,

An authentication bypass has been found in certain combinations of
InspIRCd and Atheme IRC Services. By abusing a mismatch of expectations
between Atheme and InspIRCd, an attacker can start a challenge-response
login and then end the IRC handshake in such a way that Atheme considers
it to have succeeded. On some Atheme versions, the target account does
not need to have challenge-response authentication enabled.

# Vulnerable software

This vulnerability arises from a combination of two pieces of software.
Neither is expected to be vulnerable as part of any other software stack.

Atheme prior to commit 4e664c75d0b280a052eb[1] is vulnerable (the
potential for shenanigans was noted at the time of this commit, but the
combination with InspIRCd was not). This affects the following release
series:

      - 7.1 (unsupported)
      - 7.2 (fixed in 7.2.12)

However, one of the following SASL authentication mechanisms must also
be enabled in order to exploit this vulnerability:

      - ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE (available in versions 7.1, 7.2, master)
      - SCRAM-SHA-* (available in master only)
      - ECDH-X25519-CHALLENGE (available in master only)

Atheme releases in the 7.2 series, and 7.2 and later development
versions, are vulnerable to the general attack. In Atheme 7.1 only
accounts with challenge-response authentication enabled can be targeted.

The InspIRCd behaviour that enables this attack was introduced in commit
407b2e004cf66e442771[2] and reverted in 6703b8065ccaa0acb503[3]. This
affects the 3.x and 4.x release series.

# Mitigation

Unload all SASL modules that implement challenge-response authentication:

      - /OS MODUNLOAD saslserv/scram
      - /OS MODUNLOAD saslserv/ecdh-x25519-challenge
      - /OS MODUNLOAD saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge

Alternatively, upgrade Atheme 7.2 to 7.2.12, or upgrade Atheme master to
commit 4e664c75d0b280a052eb (or later), and restart services.

# Analysis

Ignoring other features and trivial permutations, a challenge-response
login to IRC should look like this (this example is for the SCRAM-SHA-1
mechanism, taken from RFC 5802 Section 5, but a similar flow is also
used in the other mechanisms):

      C->S: CAP REQ :sasl
      C->S: USER alice 8 * :alice
      C->S: NICK alice
      S->C: :irc.example.net CAP * ACK :sasl
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :SCRAM-SHA-1
      S->C: AUTHENTICATE :+
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :biwsbj11...a3hkYXdM
      S->C: AUTHENTICATE :cj1meWtv...NDA5Ng==
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :Yz1iaXdz...NFRzPQ==
      S->C: AUTHENTICATE :dj1ybUY5...a0ZzS1E9
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :+
      S->C: :irc.example.net 900 alice alice!~alice@....example.org user
:You are now logged in as user
      S->C: :irc.example.net 903 alice :SASL authentication successful
      C->S: CAP END
      S->C: :irc.example.net 001 alice :Welcome to the Example Internet
Relay Chat Network alice

Since the username to authenticate against (given in the second
client-to-server AUTHENTICATE message) is needed to look up the
challenge materials, it is remembered by Atheme for the duration of the
authentication flow. Due to the mechanics of IRC server-to-server
protocols, a successful authentication must be remembered too, so that
the client can be considered logged in by Atheme once it completes the
handshake and is introduced to the network.

Unfortunately, prior to 4e664c75d0b280a052eb, the storage for a pending
authentication and a successful authentication are one and the same.
Atheme does not know whether it has validated an authentication flow,
but relies on the IRCd to abort SASL authentication if it is in progress
when the handshake ends. On InspIRCd, which does not do this, an
attacker can simply end the handshake as soon as she receives the
challenge, and Atheme will consider her to have logged in.

SASL separates the concept of authentication identity ("authcid") and
authorization identity ("authzid"). An account with sufficient
privileges (in real use usually a technical account rather than a human
user) can use its own credentials, identified by its authcid, to log
into some other account, identified by the authzid. Atheme introduced
full support for this feature in version 7.2.

In the exploit scenario Atheme accepts the supplied identities without
question, and will not even check that the authcid account has the right
to impersonate the authzid. An attacker can therefore simply set authcid
to an account name that is known to enable challenge-response
authentication and authzid to the account name of the victim. There is
nothing the victim can do to avoid this.

# Exploitation

In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need an account with
challenge-response authentication enabled, or a network that uses SASL
SCRAM (which requires no special setup on the part of the attacker). If
we want to use a mechanism other than SCRAM, we can simply enable
challenge-response authentication for our own account with a SET command:

      C->S: USER evil 8 * :evil
      C->S: NICK evil
      C->S: NS REGISTER hunter2 foo@....example.com
      C->S: NS SET X25519-PUBKEY
LQDwvl3ECsZh/mXXKuwMw56inOOO/iW1tGOgYy64+lg=

Then, in a new session, use that account to get into an account of our
choice. To prepare, encode the name of our account and our victim's like
this:

      $ printf '%s\0%s' 'evil' 'alice' | base64 -w0
      ZXZpbABhbGljZQ==

Start logging in, and then interrupt the authentication flow with CAP END:

      C->S: CAP REQ :sasl
      C->S: USER evil 8 * :evil
      C->S: NICK evil
      S->C: :irc.example.net CAP * ACK :sasl
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :ECDH-X25519-CHALLENGE
      S->C: AUTHENTICATE :+
      C->S: AUTHENTICATE :ZXZpbABhbGljZQ==
      S->C: AUTHENTICATE :1gVR5CbC...unw2hHyA
      C->S: CAP END
      S->C: :irc.example.net 001 evil :Welcome to the Example Internet
Relay Chat Network evil
      [...]
      S->C: :saslserv!saslserv@...vices.example.net NOTICE evil :Last
login from: [...] on [...].

 From Atheme's point of view, we are now logged in as "alice". The IRCd
disagrees, and so, for example, we could not immediately gain access to
channels that only alice is allowed to join, but we can fix that in any
number of ways (such as by changing the victim's account name, or adding
new credentials to the victim's account and opening a new connection
using them).

Note that nothing we sent depended on the server's responses; this
attack takes no intelligence to execute. This also works for
ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE and SCRAM-* in much the same way. Also, for
Atheme 7.1, SASL's authorization ID is ignored, so only victims with
challenge-response authentication already enabled are vulnerable.

Aaron Jones (amdj) of Atheme assisted with the proof-of-concept
exploitation and preparation of this report, and took great pains to
ensure affected installations were notified.

saslserv/main: Track EID we're pending login to

```
The existing model does not remember that we've sent a SVSLOGIN for a
given SASL session, and simply assumes that if a client is introduced
with a SASL session open, that session must have succeeded. The security
of this approach requires ircd to implicitly abort SASL sessions on
client registration.

This also means that if a client successfully authenticates and then
does something else its pending login is forgotten about, even though a
SVSLOGIN has been sent for it, and the ircd is going to think it's
logged in.

This change removes the dependency on ircd's state machine by keeping
explicit track of the pending login, i.e. the one we've most recently
sent a SVSLOGIN for. The next commit will ensure that a client abort
(even an implicit one) doesn't blow that information away.
