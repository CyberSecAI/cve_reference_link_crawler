- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper synchronization in the `ccd` component leads to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition leading to potential memory corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Local
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are required. No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
