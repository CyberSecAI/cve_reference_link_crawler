#### Introduced: 21 Jan 2022

[CVE-2021-45958  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45958) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-787  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `ujson` to version 5.2.0 or higher.

## Overview

[ujson](https://pypi.org/project/ujson) is an Ultra fast JSON encoder and decoder for Python

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-Bounds Write via a stack-based buffer overflow in `Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked` (called from `encode`).

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

| Hi  Recently [CVE-2021-45958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45958) was published which is an assignment due to the oss-fuzz report in  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=36009>  see as well <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-vulns/blob/main/vulns/ujson/OSV-2021-955.yaml>  This reference says:  events: - introduced: [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da) - fixed: 5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362  where though the 5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362 refers to a change in the AFL++ fuzzer:  [AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus@5525f8c](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/commit/5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362) (see <https://oss-fuzz.com/revisions?job=libfuzzer_asan_ujson&range=202112170603:202112180609>).  Quoting a mail from MITRE:  Some of the possibilities are:   1. There was never a buffer overflow. It was simply an artifact    of an older version of the AFLplusplus fuzzing software. 2. There still is a buffer overflow, but it is no longer    detected. In particular, the introduced value above    corresponds to    [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da)    -- this has function names that mention the "Buffer Append    Unchecked" words. One might guess that "Unchecked" means    accepting the risk of a buffer overflow.   MITRE confirmed that the CVE could be rejected if it can be confirmed that the reproducer testcase from <https://oss-fuzz.com/download?testcase_id=5751832088543232> does not have a buffer overflow for the ujson.encode call shown in <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/ujson/hypothesis_structured_fuzzer.py> for UltraJSON 4.0.2.  Do you have any more insights here? |

| The vulnerability exists and has existed since long before [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da). The goal posts to reproduce have moved around a bit since as changes have been made which probably explains the confusion on oss-fuzz's side. [#501](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/501) has the best reproducer I've seen so far. Fix is on its way. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-dbf6e00ba8
2022-03-26 14:56:28.655697
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python-fastapi
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 0.75.0
Release : 3.fc36
URL : <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>
Summary : FastAPI framework
Description :
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs
with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

��� Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette
and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

��� Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.\*
��� Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.\*
��� Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time
debugging.
��� Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
��� Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter
declaration. Fewer bugs.
��� Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive
documentation.
��� Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards
for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

\* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production
applications.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

The key features are:

��� Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette
and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

��� Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.\*
��� Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.\*
��� Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time
debugging.
��� Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
��� Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter
declaration. Fewer bugs.
��� Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive
documentation.
��� Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards
for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

\* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production
applications.

### @bwoodsend **[bwoodsend](/bwoodsend)** commented [Feb 9, 2022](#issue-1129003942) • edited by hugovk Loading

Fixes [#334](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/334),

fixes [#501](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/501),

fixes [#502](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/502),

fixes [#503](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/503).

[#402](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/402) also passes ok with this change but it worked before it too. I could only reproduce the issue by `git checkout 2.0.2` so I vote that we close that one too.

Changes proposed in this pull request:

* Add some extra memory resizes where needed.
* Add some tests that used to but no longer cause memory issues.
* Add a DEBUG compile mode to make memory issues easier to find and fix.
* Include said DEBUG mode in CI/CD testing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Wonderful, thanks for this!  So I first looked at why [#503](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/503) no longer happens. And to be honest, the reason for that seems ... not very great. Here's why. For every escaped string, there are now two buffer reservation calls. One is made before the quote is written to the buffer, the other after, but the length calculation accounts for the starting quote both times. This means that the reservation call inside `Buffer_EscapeStringValidated` effectively ensures that one extra byte after the string's ending quote is allocated. Therefore, the comma or closing bracket for the array or object cannot overrun the buffer. Relying on this seems insecure and prone to break with future changes to me – it does work though...  ... unless you disable `JSON_NO_EXTRA_WHITESPACE`, because then a space is written after the comma following every item, and that space can overrun the buffer. For example, this segfaults when `JSON_NO_EXTRA_WHITESPACE` is not defined: `python3 -c 'import ujson; ujson.dumps(["aa", "\x00" * 10921, "b"])'`  Indentation with lists can still overrun the buffer even in the normal config though: `python3 -c 'import ujson; ujson.dumps(["aaaaa", "\x00" * 10920, "b"*10], indent=1)'` The comma after the NUL string uses up the buffer, but then the newline for the indentation (not the indentation itself) is added without a further buffer reservation, so it overruns the buffer. In my quick tests, the element after it had to be at least a string of length 10 to trigger a SIGSEGV, although the buffer is definitely overrun regardless.  The code mentions a worst-case representation of doubles in a few places, and I think that could also be a potential way to trigger a segfault via lists/dicts. However, I'm not sure how to actually get such a double to play around with it. I tried a few values that I thought should have very long string representations but couldn't get anywhere near 256 bytes. To further my confusion, the `buf` variable in `Buffer_AppendDoubleDconv` is actually only 128 bytes, not 256...? I quickly glanced at the dconv code, but that's quite complex, so I didn't look into it further. I'd appreciate some insight into that to make sure that part's robust as well.  Another problematic scenario that comes to mind is that the indentation level as well as the indentation depth are defined as `int`, which is implementation-defined and may be as small as a signed 16-bit integer. While that's likely a non-issue for the actual values (who'd have 2^15 or more spaces per level or levels of indentation‽), the product of the two in the calculation of the buffer reservation could overflow in realistic scenarios, which would then let the indentation writes overrun the buffer. (This may be a minor concern because it'd require very deeply nested structures, large indentation, and an odd/old machine/compiler that doesn't have a 32-bit `int` as has of course been common for many years now.) |

It's probably a good idea to test broader than this, like light fuzz tests with slightly varying indentation depths and string lengths. That way, future changes that shift these things in minor ways (e.g. spaces after key and item separators by default) wouldn't render these tests immediately irrelevant.

| In general, things to consider:   * Parity with stdlib `json`: well no compile flags there * Don't want to break lots of people's code:   + hard to judge usage   + searching this repo, beyond recent security things only [JSON\_NO\_EXTRA\_WHITESPACE error #245](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/245)   + searching GitHub doesn't really bring much up * Security can be more important than features   When removing things, it's always good to raise deprecation warnings in a release (or several) first, then remove with a major bump. Ideally deprecations should be around for some time, but for a security issue we can do it quickly. |

| I agree with removing `JSON_NO_EXTRA_WHITESPACE` entirely as well. It's not even a simple compile flag as you can't set `CFLAGS` or similar but have to unset it in the header file. It's also undocumented as far as I can tell, so apart from a handful of people that dug around in the code, it's probably not even used much. And personally, I don't even bother with deprecation warnings for undocumented features on my own projects; if it's undocumented, it's subject to unannounced change at any time in my eyes, like any internal code. Also, I discovered these segfaults while looking into implementing [#283](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/283), and the flag would be all but obsolete and an annoying complication with that. |

| I can't think of a way to overrun the buffer now – apart from the potential `indent * level` overflow on odd platforms and the potential unknown worst-case double representation mentioned above.  I still don't like that the code relies on the `Buffer_Reserve` call from `Buffer_EscapeStringValidated` or `Buffer_EscapeStringUnvalidated` reserving more buffer than the string encoding requires though. This can easily lead to similar issues in the future. Personally, I'd rather not have reserve calls in those functions at all (`encode` already reserves buffer before calling them) and then add an explicit reservation for the item separator and indentation newline. Such an explicit reservation would be needed for the `separators` implementation anyway since the separator will have a variable length. |

| Yes, that's what I'm referring to. And yeah, also some of the other reservations are bigger than needed (like the `+ 4` [here](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/pull/504/files#diff-e0a169c026e4c6c178aa466bd7a0f70f8099323c80f2b2ee03c5e78cb920dafcR770) where `+ 2` would be enough). It's safe to overestimate, sure, but it can also lead to confusion in the future and less maintainable code, which can then turn into buffer overflows or other security issues again. And there's not really a good reason to overestimate, is there? If the logic is solid and it's obvious from the code why the reservations are always sufficient, that's exactly as safe and much clearer for anyone not deeply familiar with the codebase. |

Sounds good, let's put it on the CI in its own workflow. A single `ubuntu-latest` and 3.10 should be enough?

### **[JustAnotherArchivist](/JustAnotherArchivist)** commented [Feb 13, 2022](#issuecomment-1038279011)

| If I reduce that `+4` to `+3` then `tests/test_ujson.py::test_issue_334[4]` overflows. I guess that probably implies that there should be another reserve call elsewhere instead of overestimating that one.  Oh, I think I see why now. That `+4` also covers a comma + newline on an outer array/object, like the one on strings did previously. So if you have input like `[[..., "a"], "b"]` with indentation, the `+4` covers the newline after `"a"`, the closing bracket for the inner array, the comma in the outer array, and the newline after it. I still think the only reasonable way of properly fixing this is an explicit `Buffer_Reserve(enc, 2)` reservation before appending the comma and newline (and just `+2` at the end of arrays and objects).  By the way, the removal of the `+1` on the inner string reservations again causes a buffer overrun on `ujson.dumps(["aaaaa", "\x00" * 10920, ""], indent=1)`. (As before, I have to use `"b"*10` instead of an empty string to get an actual segfault.) This would be fixed automatically with the explicit comma/newline reservation above, as the reservations from the string functions wouldn't be needed at all then. |

One thing we might want to do in testing this is to change the initial size of the buffer in objToJSON to something much, much smaller. This will slow it down due to the repeated resizing of the buffer, but means we'll spend much more time near the limit of the buffer.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| What did you do? `python3 -c 'import ujson; print(ujson.encode({"a": True}, indent=65539))' >/dev/null`  This is the smallest value that triggers the segfault on my machine with this build of ujson. I'm sure it's no coincidence that it's slightly larger than 64 KiB. What did you expect to happen? Properly (if poorly) formatted output What actually happened? SIGSEGV What versions are you using?  * OS: Debian Sid * Python: 3.10.1 * UltraJSON: [316d384](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/316d384f41a9eb0268cf48988f711b15c1f6cc36)  ---   I think the reason might lie in the fact that the `Buffer_Reserve` call in `encode` does not appear to account for indentation at all. I wouldn't be surprised if other things could also trigger buffer overruns in certain conditions, e.g. the absence of `JSON_NO_EXTRA_WHITESPACE` causing the insertion of extra spaces.  [#334](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/334) and [#402](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/402) might be symptoms of the same underlying bug. Note that they both use indentation. |

| We're aware of this one. I'm supposed to be in the process of fixing it (although I haven't been particularly proactive about it). |

| Hello! Any updates on this issue? I'm having this problem too, but with indent = 1 in a larger file.  `df1.to_json("/path/to/output/file1.json", indent = 1)` `df2.to_json("/path/to/output/file2.json", indent = 1)`  file1 is 78M - no Segmentation fault file2 is 81M - Segmentation fault (core dumped) If I run file2 without indent, I have no problem  Python 3.10.4 Ubuntu 22.04  I would appreciate if anybody can help me solve this problem. Thank you! |

| I'm guessing that you're using pandas? They've got [their own copy of ujson](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/9ca7729118ab8c5227c8a2246a3606652bca754e/pandas/_libs/src/ujson) so you should take this up with them. |
