| What did you do? `python3 -c 'import ujson; print(ujson.encode({"a": True}, indent=65539))' >/dev/null`  This is the smallest value that triggers the segfault on my machine with this build of ujson. I'm sure it's no coincidence that it's slightly larger than 64¬†KiB. What did you expect to happen? Properly (if poorly) formatted output What actually happened? SIGSEGV What versions are you using?  * OS: Debian Sid * Python: 3.10.1 * UltraJSON: [316d384](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/316d384f41a9eb0268cf48988f711b15c1f6cc36)  ---   I think the reason might lie in the fact that the `Buffer_Reserve` call in `encode` does not appear to account for indentation at all. I wouldn't be surprised if other things could also trigger buffer overruns in certain conditions, e.g. the absence of `JSON_NO_EXTRA_WHITESPACE` causing the insertion of extra spaces.  [#334](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/334) and [#402](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/402) might be symptoms of the same underlying bug. Note that they both use indentation. |

| We're aware of this one. I'm supposed to be in the process of fixing it (although I haven't been particularly proactive about it). |

| Hello! Any updates on this issue? I'm having this problem too, but with indent = 1 in a larger file.  `df1.to_json("/path/to/output/file1.json", indent = 1)` `df2.to_json("/path/to/output/file2.json", indent = 1)`  file1 is 78M - no Segmentation fault file2 is 81M - Segmentation fault (core dumped) If I run file2 without indent, I have no problem  Python 3.10.4 Ubuntu 22.04  I would appreciate if anybody can help me solve this problem. Thank you! |

| I'm guessing that you're using pandas? They've got [their own copy of ujson](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/9ca7729118ab8c5227c8a2246a3606652bca754e/pandas/_libs/src/ujson) so you should take this up with them. |
