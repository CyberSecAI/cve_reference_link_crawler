| Hi  Recently [CVE-2021-45958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45958) was published which is an assignment due to the oss-fuzz report in  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=36009>  see as well <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-vulns/blob/main/vulns/ujson/OSV-2021-955.yaml>  This reference says:  events: - introduced: [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da) - fixed: 5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362  where though the 5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362 refers to a change in the AFL++ fuzzer:  [AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus@5525f8c](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/commit/5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362) (see <https://oss-fuzz.com/revisions?job=libfuzzer_asan_ujson&range=202112170603:202112180609>).  Quoting a mail from MITRE:  Some of the possibilities are:   1. There was never a buffer overflow. It was simply an artifact    of an older version of the AFLplusplus fuzzing software. 2. There still is a buffer overflow, but it is no longer    detected. In particular, the introduced value above    corresponds to    [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da)    -- this has function names that mention the "Buffer Append    Unchecked" words. One might guess that "Unchecked" means    accepting the risk of a buffer overflow.   MITRE confirmed that the CVE could be rejected if it can be confirmed that the reproducer testcase from <https://oss-fuzz.com/download?testcase_id=5751832088543232> does not have a buffer overflow for the ujson.encode call shown in <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/ujson/hypothesis_structured_fuzzer.py> for UltraJSON 4.0.2.  Do you have any more insights here? |

| The vulnerability exists and has existed since long before [a920bfa](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/commit/a920bfa9d85bcd78836b866d1be80c1e3dcca1da). The goal posts to reproduce have moved around a bit since as changes have been made which probably explains the confusion on oss-fuzz's side. [#501](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues/501) has the best reproducer I've seen so far. Fix is on its way. |
