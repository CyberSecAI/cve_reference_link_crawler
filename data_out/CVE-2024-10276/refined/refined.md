{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user input provided through the 'z' parameter in the URL, allowing the injection of malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web page, stealing of sensitive information, or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with an XSS payload in the 'z' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that the victim will visit, either by tricking them into clicking the malicious link directly or embedding it on another website."
