# Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP) 9.2.

**CVE-2024-0799 - wizardLogin Authentication Bypass (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.EdgeLoginServiceImpl.doLogin(). When a NULL password is passed to the method, a UUID is used for authentication:

  public void doLogin(HttpSession session, Boolean isLocal, String username, String password, String domain, String hostname, String protocol, int port) throws ClientException {

  [...]

      if (password != null) {

        client.getBaseService().validateUser(username, password, domain);

      } else {

        String uuid = CommonUtil.retrieveCurrentAppUUID();

        if (ConsoleConfiguration.getInstance().getRemoteWebservice() != null &&

          Boolean.valueOf(ConsoleConfiguration.getInstance().getRemoteWebservice().getUdpUseWebservice()).booleanValue()) {

          [logger.info](http://logger.info/)("get uuid by webservice");

          uuid = client.getBaseService().validateUserByUser(ConsoleConfiguration.getInstance().getRemoteWebservice().getRemoteUdpWebserviceUserName(),

              ConsoleConfiguration.getInstance().getRemoteWebservice().getRemoteUdpWebservicePassword(),

              ConsoleConfiguration.getInstance().getRemoteWebservice().getRemoteUdpWebserviceHost());

        }

        client.getBaseService().validateUserByUUID(uuid);

      }

  [...]

The doLogin() method fetches the correct UUID, so the login would succeed.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a POST HTTP message without the password parameter to endpoint /management/wizardLogin. Once authenticated, the attacker can perform UDP Console tasks that require authentication.

PoC:

This vulnerability is chained by the following vulnerability to perform unauthenticated path traversal file upload. The PoC for this vulnerability is incorporated into the PoC of the following vulnerability.

**CVE-2024-0800 - Authenticated Path Traversal File Upload (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**

A path traversal vulnerability exists in edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.servlet.ImportNodeServlet. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this to upload arbitrary files to any directory on the file system where the UDP Console is installed. The upload operation is carried out under the security context of SYSTEM.

PoC:

python3 arcserve\_udp\_console\_wizardLogin\_auth\_bypass.py -t <target> -p 8015 -f /tmp/malicious\_file -s '\Windows\System32\existing\_exe\_to\_be\_replaced.exe'

Logging in to Arcserve UDP Console via wizardLogin (Authentication Bypass)

Uploading local file /tmp/malicious\_file to \Windows\System32\existing\_exe\_to\_be\_replaced.exe on the target host

The local file was uploaded to the target host as the following:

C:\Program Files\Arcserve\Unified Data Protection\Management\Report\Temp\2023\_12\_01\_\_20\_54\_58\_355\/../../../../../../../../..//Windows/System32/existing\_exe\_to\_be\_replaced.exe

**CVE-2024-0801 - Unauthenticated DoS in ASNative.dll (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)**

When logging in to the Arcserve UDP Console with the validateUserByUser API call, the login username is processed by code in ASNative.dll. If the username is a fully qualified username (i.e., domain\username), the domain part is extracted by calling wcsncpy\_s():

// ASNative.dll, file version 9.0.6034.674

[...]

If the fully qualified username starts with \ or /, the value 0 is passed as the second parameter to wcsncpy\_s(). This will trigger the invalid parameter handler, which by default will terminate the process.
