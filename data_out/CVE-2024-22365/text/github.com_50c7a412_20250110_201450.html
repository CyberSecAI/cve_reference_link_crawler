Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM.

NOTES:

How to use it is as follows:

Please look at the ci/install-dependencies.sh for the necessary
prerequisite packages to be able to build the Linux-PAM. The script
is targeted at Debian based Linux distributions so the package
names and availability might differ on other distributions.

First, configure the build using meson setup:

      mkdir build
      meson setup <your-options> build

Then compile:

      meson compile -C build

To make sure everything was compiled correct, run:

      meson test -C build

If a test fails, you should not continue to install this build.
These tests require a suitable file /etc/pam.d/other; if necessary,
create such a file containing, e.g., these five lines (not indented)

	#%PAM-1.0
	auth	 required	pam_deny.so
	account	 required	pam_deny.so
	password required	pam_deny.so
	session	 required	pam_deny.so

Note, if you are worried - don't even think about doing the next line
(most Linux distributions already support PAM out of the box, so if
something goes wrong with installing the code from this version your
box may stop working..)

      meson install -C build

That said, please report problems to the bug reporting database
at <https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues> .

To generate manual pages from the XML source files you need the
docbook-xsl stylesheets in version 1.69.1 or newer, older versions had
a bug which generates a broken layout.

```
