…tuations

Without O_DIRECTORY the path crawling logic is subject to e.g. FIFOs
being placed in user controlled directories, causing the PAM module to
block indefinitely during `openat()`.

Pass O_DIRECTORY to cause the `openat()` to fail if the path does not
refer to a directory.

With this the check whether the final path element is a directory
becomes unnecessary, drop it.
