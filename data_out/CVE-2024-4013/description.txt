A bug exists in the API, mesh_node_power_off(), which fails to copy the contents of the Replay Protection 
List (RPL) from RAM to NVM before powering down, resulting in the ability to replay unsaved messages. Note that as of June 2024, the Gecko SDK was renamed to the Simplicity SDK, and the versioning scheme 
was changed from Gecko SDK vX.Y.Z to Simplicity SDK YYYY.MM.Patch#.
