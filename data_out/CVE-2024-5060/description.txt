The LottieFiles â€“ JSON Based Animation Lottie & Bodymovin for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.10.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
