## How Does It Work? 1. Register Your Username Let's say your username is **johndoe**. You can now use \*@johndoe.anonaddy.com (or .me) as your email. Where \* denotes any valid local part for an email address. If you would like to remain anonymous choose a username that is not linked to your real name or identity and that you haven't used anywhere else. You can also create aliases at **shared domains** if you are concerned about others linking alias ownership to you. Register Email Aliases 2. Create Aliases Either **on the fly** or **generated** beforehand. Next time you are signing up to a website or newsletter, simply make up a new alias and enter that instead of your real email address. For example, if you are on vuejs.org and you want to sign up to their newsletter you could simply enter **vuejs@johndoe.anonaddy.com** (or .me). We'll automatically create the alias in your dashboard as soon as it receives its first email. You can reply to emails and send from aliases anonymously too! 3. Manage Aliases Let's say a spammer gets hold of one of your aliases and starts sending unsolicited email to it. You can simply toggle a switch in your dashboard and deactivate that alias. Our system will then silently **discard** any further emails and you won't be forwarded anything else for that alias. You can also delete the alias. Then our system will **reject** any emails and respond with an error. Manage Aliases

## Features You'll Love Mobile Apps Beautiful native mobile apps with a buttery smooth user experience to manage your account on the go. Completely free to use whether you are using addy.io or your own self-hosted instance. The mobile apps are availalbe on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/addy-io/id6563138633) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.stjin.anonaddy) and are both [open-source](https://github.com/anonaddy)! Mobile Apps Browser Extension Browser Extension Generate new aliases in a couple of clicks straight from your browser using the [open-source](https://github.com/anonaddy/browser-extension) browser extension. The extension is available for download on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/addy_io/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/addyio-anonymous-email-fo/iadbdpnoknmbdeolbapdackdcogdmjpe), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/addyio-anonymous-email/ohjlgpcfncgkijjfmabldlgnccmgcehl) and [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/addy-io-extension/id6670220050)! Also available on other chromium based browsers such as Brave and Vivaldi. GPG/OpenPGP Encryption Bring your own GPG/OpenPGP public keys and add them per recipient. You can then easily toggle encryption on and off. With encryption on, all forwarded messages will be encrypted with your public key. Only you will be able to decrypt them with the corresponding private key. You can even hide and encrypt the email subject! This is great if you are using Gmail or Outlook and wish to prevent any inbox snooping. GPG/OpenPGP Encryption Custom Domains Custom Domains If you have your own domain you can add it and use it exactly like your username subdomain aliases e.g. **alias@example.com**. You can also enable or disable the **catch-all** functionality for each of your domains. Don't want to enable catch-all? You can still create aliases on-the-fly by **matching a regular expression**! You can then manage your aliases and deactivate/delete any that start receiving spam! Blend Into The Crowd If you don't like the fact that all your aliases contain your username then you can generate random unique aliases from your dashboard. The generated aliases will look something like this **x481n904@anonaddy.me** or **circus.waltz449@anonaddy.me** This prevents anyone linking ownership of the alias to you. UUID Aliases Reply to and Send from Reply To And Send From Aliases Reply **anonymously** to forwarded emails, the sender will receive the email as if it has come from the alias. You can even initiate an email conversation by sending an email from one of your aliases. Your real email address is **not revealed** when replying or sending from an alias. Add Additional Usernames You can add additional usernames to your account and use them exactly like the one you signed up with. So if you signed up as johndoe you can add johnsmith as an additional username and then use **anyalias@johnsmith.anonaddy.com** too. This can be used to compartmentalise your aliases. You could have a username for work emails a different one for personal emails etc. Additional Usernames Multiple Recipients Multiple Recipients Per Alias If you'd like an alias to go to more than one recipient you can easily add multiple recipients from your dashboard. You can even add recipients to an alias as it is created by doing **alias+2.3.4@user.anonaddy.com** Where 2,3 and 4 are the keys for existing recipients in your account. API Access Manage your aliases, recipients, domains and additional usernames using the addy.io API. In order to use the API you first need to generate an API Key in your account settings.

“I've been using Addy.io for a few years now and it's been absolutely brilliant. Well worth the small amount of money for additional premium features which it seems are being increased and improved on a regular basis. This extension just makes the service even better. Great work!”
