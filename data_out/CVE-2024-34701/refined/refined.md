Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the CreateWiki extension in MediaWiki not properly validating if a user is the actual requester of a wiki creation request. It relies solely on a comparison of local user IDs across different wikis in a wiki farm. This is problematic because local user IDs are not unique across wikis. If a user manages to obtain the same local ID on a different wiki as the original requester on the wiki where the request was made, they are then able to take actions associated with that user for the wiki request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The system incorrectly authorizes users based on matching local IDs across wikis.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not validate or verify if the user is indeed the original creator of the request.
- **Cross-wiki ID Collision:** User ID's are local to each wiki.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate the original wiki requester.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can perform actions on the wiki request that are normally only allowed for the requester such as posting comments or editing the request.
- **Data integrity violation:** An attacker could potentially modify the wiki request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via the web interface
- **Cross-wiki:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the CreateWiki extension handles requests across different wikis within the same farm. An attacker must create an account with the same local user ID as the wiki requester on a wiki other than the one where the request was originally created to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the wiki farm:** The attacker must have an account on at least one of the wikis within the wiki farm.
- **Ability to create a user with specific user id:** The attacker must somehow create an account on a wiki that results in them having the same local user ID as the user that created the original wiki request. This can be achieved if the attacker creates an account on another wiki, before the original requester does on their wiki (as user id's are usually just incremental integers in MediaWiki)
- **Knowledge of the targeted user id** The attacker must be aware of the local id of the targeted user.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by restricting access to the CreateWiki REST API and special pages to only the "global wiki", configured in the `$wgCreateWikiGlobalWiki` setting.
*   Workarounds include disabling the special pages and the REST API outside of the global wiki through configuration changes (`$wgCreateWikiDisableRESTAPI`, `$wgConf`).
*   The fix was implemented in commit [02e0f29](https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/commit/02e0f298f8d35155c39aa74193cb7b867432c5b8).
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.9.
*   The primary fix involved changes to several files in the CreateWiki extension, mainly to check the global wiki and disable the REST API and special pages for non-global wikis.
*  The issue was tracked in the Miraheze issue tracker as [T12102](https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12102) and [T12011](https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12011)
