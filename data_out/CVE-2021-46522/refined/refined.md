The provided content relates to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability reported as issue #196 in the `cesanta/mjs` GitHub repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `mjs` JavaScript engine when processing a specific JavaScript code snippet involving `JSON.stringify` and `indexOf`. The overflow happens during the string search operation (`mg_strstr`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A memory corruption issue arises due to an out-of-bounds write during string manipulation within the `mjs` engine's implementation of `indexOf` and potentially stringification logic within `JSON.stringify`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can often lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data.
- Program crash: The provided output indicates that the program crashes due to the memory corruption detected by AddressSanitizer.
- Denial of Service: A crash could be used to cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerability occurs by providing a specially crafted JavaScript code snippet to the `mjs` engine.
- The specific code uses the `JSON.stringify` and `indexOf` functions to trigger the overflow in `mg_strstr` during the processing of the stringified representation of a javascript object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of the vulnerable `mjs` engine.
- The attacker could be a malicious web page or javascript code being run within a device using the vulnerable engine.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific combination of `JSON.stringify` and `indexOf` functions.
- The overflow happens in `mg_strstr` which is called by `mjs_string_index_of`
- The size of the overflow is greater than 19 bytes as indicated in the error message.
- The memory is allocated using `realloc` and resized using `mbuf_resize`, suggesting the usage of an expandable buffer to manage string data.
- The ASAN output provides the call stack of the crash.
- The test case includes nested calls to function `JSEtest`, which is used to ensure the trigger happens in the context of the execution.
- The commit hash related to the vulnerability is provided `b1b6eac6b1e5b830a5cb14f8f4dc690ef3162551`.
