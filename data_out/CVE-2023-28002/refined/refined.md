- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of integrity check value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is due to an improper validation of the integrity check value of the root file system during the boot process of FortiOS VMs. This allows for a bypass of the filesystem integrity check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with administrative privileges can boot a malicious image and execute unauthorized code or commands, thus bypassing the intended security mechanism.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local administrative privileges on the FortiOS VM.
