- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to the manipulation of HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary attack code, potentially taking control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating HTTP headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected device. While the base address of the stack memory needs to be obtained, the document states that this attack is possible without authentication.
