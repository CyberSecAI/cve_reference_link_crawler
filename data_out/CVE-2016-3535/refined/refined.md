Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3535:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3535
*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
*   **Component:** Oracle CRM Technical Foundation
*   **Sub-component:** Remote Launch
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because input to the 'Remote Launch' subcomponent is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization within the Remote Launch component. This allows for the injection of client-side script into the application context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the web page.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests. An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload. When a user accesses the crafted link, the malicious script gets executed in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious URL to a victim. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could potentially be remote, as they just need to be able to get the victim to click a link or access the crafted URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of security fixes released by Oracle in their July 2016 Critical Patch Update (CPU).
*   The content provides a general description of how XSS vulnerabilities work, including a code snippet demonstrating how a received, unsanitized parameter can be exploited.
*   The vulnerability has a base score of 8.2, indicating a high severity risk.
*   The provided text mentions that this vulnerability was reported by Onapsis Research Labs, who identified the lack of sanitization.

In summary, CVE-2016-3535 is a XSS vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization in Oracle CRM Technical Foundation's Remote Launch subcomponent. It allows attackers to inject malicious code and potentially compromise users interacting with the vulnerable application.
