Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-48093

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file validation during the file upload process in the "Discussions" tab of Operately v.0.1.0. Specifically, the system fails to check file extensions or content types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The application allows users to upload files without any restrictions on file types or content, creating an avenue for malicious file injection.
- Lack of File Extension Validation: The application does not validate file extensions, allowing for the upload of executable files disguised with arbitrary extensions.
- Lack of Content Type Validation: The application doesn't validate the content type of uploaded files, making it possible to bypass security measures that might rely on MIME type checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A successful exploit allows an attacker to upload malicious files, which when executed, can lead to remote code execution on the victim's machine.
- Full system compromise: An attacker could gain full control over a victim's system, allowing them to steal sensitive data, install further malicious software, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Privileged Account Access:** The attacker requires a privileged user account to access the "Discussions" tab.
2. **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file containing a malicious payload (e.g., a reverse shell).
3. **Social Engineering:** The attacker uses social engineering tactics to trick another user into downloading and executing the malicious file.
4. **Remote Code Execution:** Upon execution, the malicious code runs on the victim's machine, enabling attacker access and further actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a privileged user account to access the file upload functionality in the "Discussions" tab.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious file payload (e.g., a reverse shell).
- The attacker may need to use social engineering to encourage another user to download and execute the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor has confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Operately greater or equal to v.0.1.0.
