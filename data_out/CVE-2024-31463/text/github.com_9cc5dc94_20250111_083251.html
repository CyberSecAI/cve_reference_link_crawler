This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use unix sockets by default for reverse proxy communication

```
Using additional ports increase the chance of conflicting with something
else on the node and is also potentially less efficient. We have used
Unix sockets via a shared directory in OpenShift for a while without any
complaints. I think upstream should do the same.
