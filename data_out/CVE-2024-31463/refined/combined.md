### @dtantsur **[dtantsur](/dtantsur)** commented [Apr 9, 2024](#issue-2233825692)

Using additional ports increase the chance of conflicting with something

else on the node and is also potentially less efficient. We have used

Unix sockets via a shared directory in OpenShift for a while without any

complaints. I think upstream should do the same.

# Unauthenticated local access to Ironic API

Moderate

[tuminoid](/tuminoid)
published
GHSA-g2cm-9v5f-qg7r
Apr 17, 2024

## Package

ironic-image
(Docker image)

## Affected versions

< 24.1.0

## Patched versions

24.1.1

## Description

Ironic-image is an OpenStack Ironic deployment packaged and configured by Metal3.

When the reverse proxy mode is enabled by the `IRONIC_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` variable set to `true`:

1. HTTP basic credentials are validated on the HTTPD side in a separate container, not in the Ironic service itself.
2. Ironic listens in host network on a private port 6388 on localhost by default.

As a result, when the reverse proxy mode is used, any Pod or local Unix user on the control plane Node can access the Ironic API on the private port without authentication.

A similar problem affects Ironic Inspector (`INSPECTOR_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` set to `true`), although the attack potential is smaller there.

### Impact

This issue affects operators deploying ironic-image in the reverse proxy mode, which is the recommended mode when TLS is used (also recommended), with the `IRONIC_PRIVATE_PORT` variable unset or set to a numeric value. In this case, an attacker with enough privileges to launch a pod on the control plane with host networking can access Ironic API and use it to modify bare-metal machine, e.g. provision them with a new image or change their BIOS settings.

### Patches

* [Use unix sockets by default for reverse proxy communication](https://github.com/metal3-io/ironic-image/pull/494)

### Workarounds

Two different workarounds are possible:

1. Switch to using unix sockets for traffic between HTTPD and Ironic/Inspector (recommended). Set the variables `IRONIC_PRIVATE_PORT` and `IRONIC_INSPECTOR_PRIVATE_PORT` to the value `unix`.
2. Temporarily stop using the reverse proxy mode (set `IRONIC_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` and `INSPECTOR_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` to `false`).

Using the workaround may require Baremetal Operator reconfiguration, depending on the deployed Metal3 configuration. See referenced pull requests.

### References

* [Ironic-image probe script addition](https://github.com/metal3-io/ironic-image/pull/492)
* [Baremetal Operator probe usage change](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1657), part of [BMO v0.6.0](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/releases/tag/v0.6.0) and newer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
Using additional ports increase the chance of conflicting with something
else on the node and is also potentially less efficient. We have used
Unix sockets via a shared directory in OpenShift for a while without any
complaints. I think upstream should do the same.
