Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/Admin/registration.php` endpoint of the SourceCodester E-Commerce Website 1.0. Specifically, the username field does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Database Extraction:** The attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Malicious Actions:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker could modify or delete data, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `/Admin/registration.php` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `fname`, specifically within the username field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `/Admin/registration.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious SQL queries into the `username` field. This typically involves submitting a crafted form with the injected payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a link to a GitHub advisory ([https://github.com/gurudattch/CVEs/blob/main/Sourcecodester-Online-Art-Gallary-Management-System-onlinadvisory-sqli.md](https://github.com/gurudattch/CVEs/blob/main/Sourcecodester-Online-Art-Gallary-Management-System-onlinadvisory-sqli.md)), which likely contains more details about the vulnerability and potentially a proof of concept.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the SourceCodester E-Commerce Website.
- The VulDB entry number for this submission is 275926.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization, which can lead to significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application's data.
