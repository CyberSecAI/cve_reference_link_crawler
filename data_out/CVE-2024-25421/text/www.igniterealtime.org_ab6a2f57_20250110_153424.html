## [Version 1.2.0 of Threaddump plugin Released!](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/version-1-2-0-of-threaddump-plugin-released "Version 1.2.0 of Threaddump plugin Released!")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)2 months, 6 days ago

Today, we’ve released a new version of the Threaddump plugin for Openfire: version 1.2.0.

The Threaddump plugin is a handy plugin to collect diagnostics, useful for drilling down into the inner workings of Openfire. It can be of great value for developers, but is of little use to others.

In this new release, compatibility with Openfire versions 4.8.0 and later has been restored! To do so, some functionality was sacrificed: the plugin will no longer offer the possibility to automatically generate thread dumps when core thread pools reach a certain level of activity.

As always, your instance of Openfire should automatically make available to update in the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the new release of the plugin at the [Threaddump plugin’s archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=threaddump).

## [Openfire 4.9.1 release](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-9-1-release "Openfire 4.9.1 release")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)2 months, 1 week ago

The [Ignite Realtime community](https://www.igniterealtime.org/) is happy to be able to announce the immediate availability of version 4.9.1 of [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/), its cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol!

4.9.1 is a bugfix and maintenance release. Among its most important fixes is one for a memory leak that affected all recent versions of Openfire (but was likely noticeable only on those servers that see high volume of users logging in and out). The complete list of changes that have gone into this release can be seen in the [change log](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html).

Please give this version a try! You can [download installers of Openfire here](https://igniterealtime.org/downloads/#openfire). Our documentation contains an [upgrade guide](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/upgrade-guide.html) that helps you update from an older version.

## [Openfire 4.9.0 release!](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-9-0-release "Openfire 4.9.0 release!")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)3 months, 3 weeks ago

The [Ignite Realtime community](https://www.igniterealtime.org/) is happy to be able to announce the immediate availability of version 4.9.0 of [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/), its cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol!

As compared to the previous non-patch release, this one is a bit smaller. This mostly is a maintenance release, and includes some preparations (deprecations, mainly) for a future release.

Highlights for this release:

* A problem has been fixed that caused, under certain conditions, a client connection to be disconnected. This appears to have affected clients sending multi-byte character data more than others.
* Community member Akbar Azimifar has provided a full Persian translation for Openfire!

The list of changes that have gone into the Openfire 4.9.0 release has some more items though! Please review the [change log](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html) for all of the details.

Interested in getting started? You can [download installers of Openfire here](https://igniterealtime.org/downloads/#openfire). Our documentation contains an [upgrade guide](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/upgrade-guide.html) that helps you update from an older version.

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)3 months, 3 weeks ago

We have now released version 1.4.1 of the HTTP File Upload plugin!

This plugin adds functionality to Openfire that allows clients to share files, as defined in the [XEP-0363 ‘HTTP File Upload’ specification](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html).

This release brings [two changes](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/1.4.1/httpfileupload/changelog.html), both provided by community members (thanks!):

* Vladislav updated the Ukrainian translation;
* Anno created an admin console page for this plugin.

As always, your instance of Openfire should automatically make available to update in the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the new release of the plugin at the [HTTP File Upload plugin’s archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=httpfileupload).

## [Openfire Hazelcast plugin version 3.0.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-hazelcast-plugin-version-3-0-0 "Openfire Hazelcast plugin version 3.0.0")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)3 months, 4 weeks ago

Earlier today, [we blogged about a boatload of Openfire plugins](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-plugin-maintenance-releases) for which we made available maintenance releases.

Apart from that, we’ve also made a more notable release: that of the Hazelcast plugin for Openfire.

The [Hazelcast plugin for Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=hazelcast) adds clustering support to Openfire. It is based on [the Hazelcast platform](https://hazelcast.com/).

This release brings a major upgrade of the platform. It migrates from version 3.12.5 to 5.3.7.

As a result, replacing an older version of the plugin with this new release requires some careful planning. Notably, the configuration stored on-disk has changed (and is unlikely to be compatible between versions). Please refer to the readme of the plugin for details.

A big thank you goes out to community member Arwen for making this upgrade happen!

As usual, the new version of the plugin will become available in your Openfire server within the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the plugin from [its archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=hazelcast).
