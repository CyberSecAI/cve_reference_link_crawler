Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-27133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of dataset table fields in MLflow when rendering recipe cards, specifically when using untrusted datasets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where malicious JavaScript can be injected into the recipe card.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Client-side Remote Code Execution (RCE) when a user views the recipe card in a Jupyter Notebook. This occurs because the malicious JavaScript can be executed within the user's browser when the notebook renders the unsanitized data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious code into a dataset that is then used in an MLflow recipe. When the recipe is inspected, the malicious code will be executed in the user's browser.
- Specifically, the attack vector involves an untrusted dataset that is processed by an MLflow Recipe and rendered as a table in the recipe card display.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a dataset that is used by a vulnerable MLflow instance.
- The victim must then view the recipe card generated from the untrusted dataset, which would typically happen within the context of a Jupyter Notebook.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided GitHub content highlights a fix for the vulnerability, where specific characters are escaped in HTML to prevent javascript code injection. The fix involved escaping characters in the dataset table fields during rendering.
-  It was discovered that `pandas_df.style.to_html(escape=True)` does not work as expected, therefore a different method of escaping was implemented using `pandas_df.to_html(escape=True)`.
