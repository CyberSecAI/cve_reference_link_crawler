- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper control of generation of code ('Code Injection') allows manipulation of the application configuration to register a specially crafted external assembly as a theme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code Injection (CWE-94) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local threat actor can execute arbitrary code at the same permission level as the vulnerable application upon next launch.
- **Attack vectors**: Local manipulation of the application configuration to register a malicious theme assembly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have pre-existing local system access and the ability to modify the application's configuration prior to launch. This is not a remote code execution vulnerability.
