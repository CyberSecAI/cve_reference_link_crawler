Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-39275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of persistent cookies containing sensitive information. These cookies remain valid even after a user's session is closed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information (CWE-539):** The system uses persistent cookies to maintain user sessions, and these cookies retain their validity even after the user logs out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session.
- The attacker can perform actions with the privileges of the hijacked user.
- This can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Can cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to obtain a valid cookie from a legitimate user.
- The attacker then uses the captured cookie to forge requests and impersonate the legitimate user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device or be able to intercept network traffic to capture the cookies.
- The attack has a low complexity, according to the report.
- No specific user interaction is required by the attacker according to CVSS v4 scoring, however, a user must be authenticated for the cookie to exist.

**Additional Notes**

- The document also lists other vulnerabilities affecting the same product (Advantech ADAM-5630), but these are not directly related to CVE-2024-39275.
- The advisory includes mitigations, such as updating the firmware and isolating the control system network from the internet.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
