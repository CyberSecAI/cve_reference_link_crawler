Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-ID:** CVE-2024-37645

**Product:** TRENDnet TEW-814DAP v1 (FW1.01B01)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `/formSysLog` handler. The `sprintf` function is used to copy the value of the `submit-url` parameter into a buffer without checking its length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function copies the attacker-controlled `submit-url` parameter into a fixed-size buffer without validating its length, leading to a buffer overflow.
- Lack of Input Validation: The length of the `submit-url` parameter is not validated before being used in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Program Hijacking: Attackers can overwrite the return address on the stack by providing a large `submit-url` value, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial-of-Service (DoS): Overwriting the stack can also cause the program to crash, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: Attackers send a crafted HTTP POST request to `/boafrm/formSysLog` with a specially crafted `submit-url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests with a crafted `submit-url` value

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the function that handles the `/formSysLog` POST request.
- The function reads the value of the parameter `submit-url`.
- The value of the `submit-url` parameter is passed to the `send_redirect_perm` function.
- Inside `send_redirect_perm`, the value (referred to as `a2` in the decompiled code snippets) is copied into a local buffer (`v14`) using `sprintf`.
- There is no check on the length of `a2` before copying, causing a stack buffer overflow if it is too large.

**Proof of Concept (POC):**

The provided Python POC demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
1. Send a POST request to `/boafrm/formSysLog`.
2. Provide a long string of 'A's as the value of the `submit-url` parameter (1000 A's are used in the POC).
3. The `sprintf` function will overflow the buffer, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
