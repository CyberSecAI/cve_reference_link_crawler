Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and authorization checks within the WP OAuth Server plugin when deleting a client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:**  The plugin does not properly verify if the user is authorized to delete a client. It allows any authenticated user, even a subscriber with minimal privileges, to perform this action.
- **CSRF Vulnerability:**  The lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can be executed by authenticated users without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Client Deletion:**  An attacker can delete any client within the OAuth server configuration, potentially disrupting services that rely on these clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with minimal privileges, like a subscriber, on the target WordPress website.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript on the target site, e.g. by using the browser's developer console
