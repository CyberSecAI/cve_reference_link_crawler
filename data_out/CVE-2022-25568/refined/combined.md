# MotionEye Config Info Disclosure

Edit: This was given CVE-2022-25568. As mentioned in my previous posts [here](https://www.pizzapower.me/2021/10/09/self-hosted-security-part-1-motioneye/) and [here](https://www.pizzapower.me/2022/01/31/update-hacking-motioneye-cve-2021-44255/), I‚Äôve done a little digging into the conditions that are required for the MotioneEye config file to be world viewable, and I‚Äôve reached this conclusion:

As long as a ‚Äúuser‚Äù password is not set, the config file will be world readable. Even if an ‚Äúadmin‚Äù password has been set, the /config/list file will still be readable by everybody. So, while someone could think they are doing the correct thing by creating a password for the admin user, they may still be leaking private information. Here is a innocuous example from a live instance:

![](https://www.pizzapower.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sftp.png)

As you can see in this picture, IP addresses/services/passwords are exposed. This is a rather innocuous example, being that it is an internal IP address, but it illustrates how this could be an issue. Imagine if those were your public FTP server credentials. Or if they were your gmail credentials for smtp notifications. The list goes on.

Along with usernames, passwords, auth keys, and email addresses, these config files also contain less sensitive information like internal network IP addresses and URLs, drive and mounting information.

In many ways this vulnerability may be worse that the MotionEye RCE vulnerability that I reported and received a CVE for. In that case, the admin password needed to be left blank (or easily guessed) for someone to get into the admin panel and achieve RCE. In this case, a user could think they‚Äôre being secure by setting an admin password, but they leave the user password blank ‚Äì and the config remains viewable.

I‚Äôve found gmail, gdrive, ftp, sftp, telegram stuff (not sure how auth works there), etc. all exposed to the WWW in these files.

I‚Äôve submitted an issue on the MotionEye github page, but if it is anything like last time, they don‚Äôt plan on fixing it/see it as a non-issue.

Edit: The issue was closed before I even finished this post.

Edit: The issue was reopened and I submitted a pull request to fix the issue, although my fix was not tested much, so it may not work properly.

| Last time I posted (in motioneyeOS maybe) about the default lack of admin password/easily bruteforced password, leaving users open to remote code execution, and it was seen as a non-issue, so this may also be a non-issue to you.  If a "user" password is unset, even if an "admin" password is set, the config file at the "/config/list" endpoint remains viewable to anybody that has access to the MotionEye instance. Using Shodan, I've found a large amount of them open to the public.  This config file contains some highly sensitive information such as email addresses and passwords for various services where uploading of files occur such as external FTP, SFTP, gmail, gdrive, telegram, and potentially others.  I just wanted to post this so people know that even if they set an "admin" password, they also need to set a "user" password - especially if their config contains sensitive information like credentials for an upload service - and even more especially if they also expose their MotionEye instance to the internet. |

| I for one didn't know that, and didn't even realise there is such an endpoint in ME. I wonder if `/config` endpoints should require admin to be able to access them. Not that it would make other auth issues right though. |

| [@pizza-power](https://github.com/pizza-power) Which set of install instructions did you use for testing on what hardware? I want to confirm at what level is the vulnerability introduced, and is it a python2.7 issue, a libmicrohttp12 issue, or something in the motionEye scripts specifically. |

| I tested with the latest docker image from the docker-compose and then just 0.42.1 I downloaded from github and manually ran. Both on Ubuntu 21.10 x86\_64 linux kernel 5.13.  Off the top of my head, it's probably just a route authentication issue in MotionEye.  Could you just change line 545 in handlers.py to @BaseHandler.auth(admin=True) - it is currently @BaseHandler.auth()? That seems to fix the issue, in my very limited testing, but I'm not as familiar with the code as you are, so maybe that will break something else. |

| Reopening this since the patch needed to be reverted. The surveillance user must have access to the config currently.  Not sure whether it would be possible to split the functions to get a limited required config list for surveillance user and the full list only as admin.  Easier would be to apply a default password for both users. This is pretty common nowadays for web applications, not an issue when documented well, and we may even add a password input and optionally as CLI argument to the new `motioneye_init` command. General CLI support has already been added to make it usable in unattended installers and CI/CD workflows. Widening it to be an interactive setup script (optionally called unattended via `--script/-s` or `--batch/-b` option e.g.) wouldn't be so difficult. |

# Update: Hacking MotionEye ‚Äì CVE-2021-44255

I was given CVE-2021-44255 for [this](https://www.pizzapower.me/2021/10/09/self-hosted-security-part-1-motioneye/) ‚Äì authenticated RCE via a malicious tasks (python pickle) file. So that‚Äôs fun. Even though it is authenticated, the default username is admin and the default password is blank, so you know how these things go. I actually haven‚Äôt heard of any MotionEye instances being used in botnets or anything.

I should probably request a CVE for the unauthenticated information disclosure that I found, but I need to do some more research on that one.

# Hacking MotionEye/MotionEyeOS

## Getting Started with MotionEye

[MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) is an open source, web-based GUI for the popular [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/) CLI application found on Linux. I‚Äôve known of the Motion command line app for years, but I didn‚Äôt know that MotionEye existed. I ran across it while trying to find a multiple webcam, GUI or web based solution for future projects.

MotionEye comes in a couple forms ‚Äì a standalone app, which I used the [docker container version](https://hub.docker.com/r/ccrisan/motioneye) of, or a ‚Äúwhole‚Äù operating system, [MotionEyeOS](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos), to install on a Raspberry Pi.

Starting off, I used Shodan search to find internet facing installations. Here is the script I used for that. If you use this script, you‚Äôll need to put in your API key and the limit parameter, which limits the API queries that you use.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
# pip3 install shodan
from shodan import Shodan
import requests

# check for api key
api = Shodan('') # Insert API key here

if api.api_key == '':
    print("No API key found! Exiting")
    sys.exit(1)

limit = 1000 # set this to limit your api query usage
counter = 0

url_file = open("urls.txt", "w")

for response in api.search_cursor('Server: motionEye'):
    ip = response['ip_str']
    port = response['port']
    url = f'http://{ip}:{port}'
    url_file.write(url + '\n')

    # Keep track of how many results have been downloaded so we don't use up all our query credits
    counter += 1
    if counter >= limit:
        break

url_file.close()
```

I ran out of query credits when I ran this script. There are thousands of installations out there. This script will output the IP addresses of those installations.

## Finding Live Feeds

In my review of the application, I found that you can make a query to the */picture/{camera-number}/current/* endpoint, and if it returns a 200 status code, it means that the feed is open to the public. You can also increment the camera-number an enumerate the numbers of cameras a feed will actually have, even if it isn‚Äôt available to view.

I took the output of motioneye-shodan.py script above, and fed it to live-feeds.py script below.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests

url_file = open("urls.txt", "r")
urls = url_file.readlines()
url_file.close()

live_urls = open("live-urls.txt", "w")

for url in urls:
    try:
        response = requests.get(url + "/picture/0/current/", verify=False, timeout=3).status_code
        print(response)
        if response == 200:
            live_urls.write(url)
    except:
        pass

live_urls.close()
```

This script outputs the URL of camera feeds that we can view. But the real question here is, what security issues are there with MotionEye?

## Information Leakage

It turns out that if you make a get request to the following endpoint */config/list*, some of the feeds will return their config files. Most of the time these config files are innocuous. I‚Äôm not sure why these are publicly accessible even if the feed is publicly accessible. Maybe it is used as an API endpoint of some sort. I need to dig into the code some more.

However, sometimes these config files contain some very sensitive information. Consider the following config with *email\_notifications\_smtp\_password* and *email\_notifications\_addresses* removed. These passwords are supposed to be for services that the public cannot access, but unfortunately people like to reuse passwords. Again, why is this file even readable?

![](https://www.pizzapower.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2021-10-09-07-41-22.png)

Along with the occasional password, email addresses are in here, internal IP addresses and ports, mounting points for local drives, etc.

## Rate-Limiting and Default Credentials

So, the default installation of MotionEye uses the username of admin and a blank password. Additionally, MotionEye does not seem to institute any sort of rate limiting on login attempts. This is a recipe for disaster.

## Authenticated RCE Method #1

Once logged in, I found two simple methods of code execution. The first of which is a classic Python cPickle deserialization exploit.

In the configuration section of the application, there is an option to backup and restore the application configurations. It turns out that if you include a malicious tasks.pickle file in the config you are restoring with, it‚Äôll be written to disk and will be loaded when the application is restarted automatically or manually.

You can simply download the current configuration to use it as a template. After downloading and extracting it, slide your malicious tasks.pickle file and tar.gz everything back up.

The final structure of my motioneye-config.tar.gz for the docker container is as follows:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ camera-1.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motion.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motioneye.conf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.pickle

Alternatively, the final structure of my motioneye-config.tar.gz lon MotionEyeOS is the following:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adjtime
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ camera-1.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crontabs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ date.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motion.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motioneye.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ntp.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ os.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proftpd.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shadow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shadow-
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ smb.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_dsa\_key
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_dsa\_key.pub
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_ecdsa\_key
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_ecdsa\_key.pub
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_ed25519\_key
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_ed25519\_key.pub
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_rsa\_key
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh\_host\_rsa\_key.pub
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static\_ip.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.pickle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watch.conf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wpa\_supplicant.conf

Pause here: You see, those are ssh keys. So you say why don‚Äôt we just try ssh? Go for it. You also may not even need a password, but some people have either secured ssh or disabled ssh on the actually raspberry pi, so it won‚Äôt work. A lot of these instances will have ssh turned off, and if it is running in docker, you probably won‚Äôt be able to download the ssh keys. Also, it is more fun to write scripts in Python.

Once the configuration is uploaded, wait for the app to reload, or, in unfortunate cases, wait for the app to be reloaded by mother nature or the victim. From what I can see, the docker application will not autoreboot. Here is a Python 3 script that will do all of this. Also, see the [github repo](https://github.com/pizza-power/motioneye-authenticated-RCE), which may be more updated.

## Authenticated RCE Method #2

Another method of code execution involves motion detection. There is an option to run a system command whenever motion is detected. The security implications of this are obvious.

## Conclusion

While authentication is needed for RCE, the presence of default credentials and lack of rate limiting make obtaining authentication straightforward. There are a lot of people running this software in a vulnerable manner.

As per my usual advice, don‚Äôt expose MotionEye to the WWW. Like all the self-hosted solutions, I advise you to install this to face your internal network and then connect to your internal network via OpenVPN or Wireguard.

Update: I was give CVE-2021-44255 for the python pickle exploit.
