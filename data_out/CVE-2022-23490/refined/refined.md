Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper access control to the `current-poll` collection in BigBlueButton.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** Meeting participants, even without moderator privileges, could subscribe to the `current-poll` collection, which contains individual poll responses. This indicates a lack of proper authorization checks to restrict access to sensitive poll data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker (any meeting participant) can gain access to individual poll responses of all users, leading to a breach of confidentiality.
- The UI does not update to show the data, only the attacker gains access to the poll data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network by any participant within a BigBlueButton meeting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Meeting Participant:** The attacker needs to be a participant in a BigBlueButton meeting with active polls.
- **Low Privileges:** No special privileges beyond being a normal meeting participant are required.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows any participant in a BigBlueButton meeting to access the results of polls in the meeting. This is achieved by subscribing to the `current-poll` collection without proper authorization checks, allowing them to see individual poll responses. The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.0 of BigBlueButton.
