This is the official release of BigBlueButton 2.4, the culmination of ~8 months of development, 1700 commits, 2 alpha, 4 beta, and 7 release candidates.

This release contains webcam improvements (thanks to switching to [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/)), anonymous polls, virtual backgrounds, and the Learning Dashboard, a dashboard view of attendance, participation, and learning (as by response to polls) for the teacher. Link to installation command / instructions/ [full list of features](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.4/new.html).

We thank [ZKI](https://www.zki.de/english), the German association of Higher Education IT centers, for funding some of the development for this release, especially in the areas of scalability and usability!

We thank Nico Heitmann, Sven Hebrok, and Juraj Somorovsky from Paderborn University who examined the BigBlueButton code base and responsibly disclosed a number of privacy and security issues that were fixed in this (and previous) releases.

We thank the many translators who helped ensure that BigBlueButton is localized into over 55 languages.

Thanks to the community members who provided feedback to the earlier 2.4 releases!

This release iteration includes multiple bug fixes and stability and security/privacy improvements.

We thank Luca Famà for [responsibly reporting](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/policy) a security finding resolved in this iteration.

# Improper access control to polling votes

Moderate

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-4qgc-xhw5-6qfg
Dec 15, 2022

## Package

bbb-html5
(BigBlueButton)

## Affected versions

<2.4.0

## Patched versions

2.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Meetings with polls are affected. The attacker is a meeting participant. The attacker can gain subscribe to the `current-poll` collection. This does not update the client UI, but gives the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses.

### Workarounds

No workarounds.

### References

Enforce permission check, allowing only allowed users to access the collection `current-poll`.

Patch in [BigBlueButton 2.4.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4.0) | [#13866](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13866)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
