# Improper access control to polling votes

Moderate

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-4qgc-xhw5-6qfg
Dec 15, 2022

## Package

bbb-html5
(BigBlueButton)

## Affected versions

<2.4.0

## Patched versions

2.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Meetings with polls are affected. The attacker is a meeting participant. The attacker can gain subscribe to the `current-poll` collection. This does not update the client UI, but gives the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses.

### Workarounds

No workarounds.

### References

Enforce permission check, allowing only allowed users to access the collection `current-poll`.

Patch in [BigBlueButton 2.4.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4.0) | [#13866](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13866)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
