Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in WECON LeviStudioU software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**: The software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This can cause data to be written beyond the buffer's boundaries, overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to achieve **remote code execution**. This means an attacker could potentially take full control of the system running the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the HMI programming software, LeviStudioU. The advisory indicates that the exploitation is not remote, meaning the attacker needs some level of access to the target machine or network to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable software, likely through a malicious file or crafted network packet (the content does not specify exactly how the overflow is triggered). The CVSS vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicates the attacker requires a "local" attack vector, "low" attack complexity, no privileges and user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
* The document indicates that WECON has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate the vulnerability.
* There is also a related vulnerability, CVE-2021-23157, which is a heap-based buffer overflow in the same software, which has the same impact.
*   No public exploits are known for this specific vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of LeviStudioU from 2019-09-21 and prior.
*   The advisory lists the affected sectors as Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems, indicating that this vulnerability could impact critical infrastructure.
