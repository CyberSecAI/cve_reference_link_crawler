## Vulnerabilities in Windows Media Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2636391)

Published: January 10, 2012 | Updated: July 31, 2012

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted media file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008; and Important for all supported editions of Windows Media Center TV Pack for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Windows Media Player handles specially crafted MIDI files and the way that DirectShow parses media files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## MIDI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0003

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted MIDI file that could allow remote code execution when played using Windows Media Player. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0003](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0003).

#### Mitigating Factors for MIDI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0003

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for MIDI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0003

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable MIDI parsing**

  **Note** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To disable MIDI parsing, perform the following steps:

  1. Back up the original MIDI parser registry value using the following command at an elevated command prompt:

     ```
     regedit /e Backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{D51BD5A2-7548-11CF-A520-0080C77EF58A}

     ```
  2. Unregister the MIDI parser using a .reg file with the following contents:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

     ```
     ```
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{D51BD5A2-7548-11CF-A520-0080C77EF58A}]

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** MIDI file playback is disabled.

## DirectShow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0004

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows handles media files. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted media file. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0004](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2004).

#### Mitigating Factors for DirectShow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0004

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In Windows Media Player 10, Windows Media Player 11, and Windows Media Player 12, the WMP security settings block the display of captions by default.

#### Workarounds for DirectShow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0004

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disablethe** **Line21 DirectShow filter**

  **Note** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To disable the Line21 DirectShow filter, perform the following steps:

  1. Back up the original Line21 DirectShow filter registry value using the following commands at an elevated command prompt:

     ```
     regedit /e Backup1.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{6E8D4A20-310C-11D0-B79A-00AA003767A7}

     ```
     ```
     regedit /e Backup1.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{E4206432-01A1-4BEE-B3E1-3702C8EDC574}

     ```
  2. Unregister the Line21 DirectShow filter using a .reg file with the following contents:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

     ```
     ```
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{6E8D4A20-310C-11D0-B79A-00AA003767A7}]

     ```
     ```
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{E4206432-01A1-4BEE-B3E1-3702C8EDC574}]

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Closed captioning is disabled

#### FAQ for DirectShow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0004

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when filters in DirectShow do not properly handle specially crafted media files.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

DirectShow (Quartz.dll and Qdvd.dll) is the component affected by this vulnerability. DirectShow is a part of DirectX.

**What is DirectX?**

Microsoft DirectX is a feature of Windows operating systems. It is used for streaming media on Windows operating systems to enable graphics and sound when playing games or watching video.

**What is DirectShow?**

DirectX consists of a set of low-level Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used by Windows programs for multimedia support. Within DirectX, the DirectShow technology performs client-side audio and video sourcing, manipulation and rendering.

Microsoft DirectShow is used for streaming media on Windows operating systems. DirectShow is used for high-quality capture and playback of multimedia streams. It automatically detects and uses video and audio acceleration hardware when available, but also supports systems without acceleration hardware. DirectShow is also integrated with other DirectX technologies. Some examples of applications that use DirectShow include DVD players, video editing applications, AVI to ASF converters, MP3 players, and digital video capture applications.

**What are DirectShow filters?**

DirectShow provides a set of default filters that install automatically with Microsoft Windows. These filters support many data formats while providing a high degree of hardware independence. An application can also register and install custom filters on the target system. For a full list of filters and further information, see the MSDN article, [DirectShow Filters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd375464%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a user an email message containing a specially crafted media file and convincing the user to open the media file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted media file. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a website hosting the specially crafted media file. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that directs them to the attacker's website.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations where users may open attachments from untrusted network locations. Servers could also be at risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that DirectShow parses media files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
