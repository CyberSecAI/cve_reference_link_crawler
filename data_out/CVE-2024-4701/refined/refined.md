- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Genie's API accepting a multipart/form-data file upload. The API uses a user-supplied filename from the request when saving the file to disk without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of the user-supplied filename during file uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the filename to perform path traversal, allowing them to write arbitrary files with user-specified content to any location on the file system where the Java process has write access. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the multipart/form-data file upload API endpoint in Genie, where a user-controlled filename is accepted as part of the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Genie API that allow file uploads and must be able to manipulate the filename. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, according to the additional information.
