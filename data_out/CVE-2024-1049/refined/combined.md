### Description

The Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks – CoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Icon Widget's in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the link value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
