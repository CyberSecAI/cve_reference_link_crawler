- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The use of a weak cryptographic algorithm in the SSH key exchange process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a weak cryptographic algorithm [CWE-327]
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker might be able to gain access to sensitive information or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by exploiting the weak key exchange.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, potentially involving eavesdropping on or intercepting SSH communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and manipulate SSH traffic between clients and the vulnerable FortiNAC system.
