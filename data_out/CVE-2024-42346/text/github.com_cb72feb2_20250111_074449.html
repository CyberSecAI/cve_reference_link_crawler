## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 24.1.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trick users into executing arbitrary javascript code when a user edits a malicious dataset using the editor visualization.

All supported versions of Galaxy are affected (i.e. 23.1, 23.2, 24.0, and 24.1). Unsupported versions are affected since the addition of the editor in version 20.05

### Patches

All supported branches of Galaxy (and more back to release\_20.05) were amended with the supplied patches.

The same patch should work for all supported versions of Galaxy and out of support Galaxy versions back to Galaxy release 20.05. The patch can be found at: <https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/CVE-2024-42346/editor-viz.patch>.

To apply the patch, navigate to the root of your Galaxy directory, then execute:

```
wget -O - "https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/CVE-2024-42346/editor-viz.patch" | patch -p1

```

or:

```
curl "https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/CVE-2024-42346/editor-viz.patch" | patch -p1

```

You can test application of the patch before applying it by adding the `--dry-run` flag to patch.

For the changes to take effect, you must restart all Galaxy server processes.

### Workarounds

You must apply the supplied patch or update to the release\_20.05 branch or newer. There are no supported workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
