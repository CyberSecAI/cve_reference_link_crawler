- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the editor visualization of Galaxy when editing a dataset. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (CWE-79). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing datasets, particularly when using the editor visualization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick users into executing arbitrary JavaScript code by injecting it into a dataset and then having the user view or edit this dataset. This code could be used for various malicious activities, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other attacks against the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker crafts a malicious dataset with embedded JavaScript code. A user viewing or editing this dataset triggers the execution of the injected code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create a dataset with malicious JavaScript and have a victim interact with this dataset via the editor visualization. The attacker requires low privileges to create the dataset. User interaction is not required for the XSS to execute.
