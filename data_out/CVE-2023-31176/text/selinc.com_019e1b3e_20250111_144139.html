# Security Notifications

Issues Reported by External Organizations or Individuals

Vulnerabilities are disclosed to SEL customers in three ways:

* For high-risk vulnerabilities—through a Service Bulletin
* For other vulnerabilities—through a revision to Appendix A of the affected product’s instruction manual
* For software products—through an addition to the [Latest Software Versions page on the SEL website](/products/software/latest-software-versions/)

After our private customer notification process is complete, we publish information about vulnerabilities reported to SEL as Security Notifications.
