## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Reporter
Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS #7, or PKCS #12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS.
*Note: This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and Evince are believed to be impacted.

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-43527

A vulnerability was found in the way the third-party component, NSS, veriﬁes certiﬁcates that could
allow an attacker to remotely execute code or cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected
devices.

This vulnerability could be triggered if a device connects to an attacker posing as an IPSEC endpoint
that provides a malicious certiﬁcate. The device maybe vulnerable when it attempts the veriﬁcation of
the received certiﬁcate.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9247443&action=edit)

I've found an exploitable memory corruption flaw when validating ECDSA signatures.

The `VFYContext` structure contains a decoded digital signature from a DER encoded certificate, and is defined like this in `cryptohi/secvfy.c`:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#120>

```
struct VFYContextStr {
    SECOidTag hashAlg; /* the hash algorithm */
    SECKEYPublicKey *key;
    /*
     * This buffer holds either the digest or the full signature
     * depending on the type of the signature (key->keyType).  It is
     * defined as a union to make sure it always has enough space.
     *
     * Use the "buffer" union member to reference the buffer.
     * Note: do not take the size of the "buffer" union member.  Take
     * the size of the union or some other union member instead.
     */
    union {
        unsigned char buffer[1];

        /* the full DSA signature... 40 bytes */
        unsigned char dsasig[DSA_MAX_SIGNATURE_LEN];
        /* the full ECDSA signature */
        unsigned char ecdsasig[2 * MAX_ECKEY_LEN];
        /* the full RSA signature, only used in RSA-PSS */
        unsigned char rsasig[(RSA_MAX_MODULUS_BITS + 7) / 8];
    } u;
    unsigned int pkcs1RSADigestInfoLen;
    /* the encoded DigestInfo from a RSA PKCS#1 signature */
    unsigned char *pkcs1RSADigestInfo;
    void *wincx;
    void *hashcx;
    const SECHashObject *hashobj;
    SECOidTag encAlg;    /* enc alg */
    PRBool hasSignature; /* true if the signature was provided in the
                          * VFY_CreateContext call.  If false, the
                          * signature must be provided with a
                          * VFY_EndWithSignature call. */
    SECItem *params;
};

```

In the code above, `MAX_EC_KEY` is 72.

The definition of `decodeECorDsaSignature()` is here:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#173>

```
static SECStatus
decodeECorDSASignature(SECOidTag algid, const SECItem *sig, unsigned char *dsig,
                       unsigned int len)

```

Here `dsig` will usually point at a `VFYContext.u.ecdsasig`, but `len` is the length of the (untrusted) signature. Therefore, it's the responsibility of `decodeECorDSASignature` to verify that that the length is under `MAX_ECKEY_LEN`. This is done correctly for `SEC_OID_ANSIX962_EC_PUBLIC_KEY`:

```
    if (algid == SEC_OID_ANSIX962_EC_PUBLIC_KEY) {
        if (len > MAX_ECKEY_LEN * 2) {
            PORT_SetError(SEC_ERROR_BAD_DER);
            return SECFailure;
        }
    }

```

This seems like a fragile design though, and indeed this routine also handles `SEC_OID_ANSIX9_DSA_SIGNATURE` but doesn't check the length in that case. I've made and attached a demo certificate.

```
(gdb) list
196	    dsasig = DSAU_DecodeDerSigToLen((SECItem *)sig, len);
197
198	    if ((dsasig == NULL) || (dsasig->len != len)) {
199	        rv = SECFailure;
200	    } else {
201	        PORT_Memcpy(dsig, dsasig->data, dsasig->len);
202	    }
203
204	    if (dsasig != NULL)
205	        SECITEM_FreeItem(dsasig, PR_TRUE);
(gdb) p dsasig->len
$14 = 4096
(gdb) x/10xb dsasig->data
0x621000001500: 0xee    0xee    0xee    0xee    0xee    0xee    0xee    0xee
0x621000001508: 0xee    0xee

```

This is from my DER:

```
$ openssl x509 -inform DER -text -noout < decodeECorDSASignature.der
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)

            Signature Algorithm: dsaWithSHA1
         r:
             00:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:
        ...

```

And where did `dsig` come from?

```
(gdb) up
#1  0x0000000000b52a08 in vfy_CreateContext (key=0x61d00000bea0, sig=0x7fffffffc8a0, encAlg=SEC_OID_ANSIX9_DSA_SIGNATURE, hashAlg=SEC_OID_SHA1, hash=0x7fffffffc8f0, wincx=0x0) at secvfy.c:499
499	                rv = decodeECorDSASignature(encAlg, sig, cx->u.buffer, sigLen);
(gdb) pt cx->u
type = union {
    unsigned char buffer[1];
    unsigned char dsasig[64];
    unsigned char ecdsasig[144];
    unsigned char rsasig[2048];
}

```

Any value length greater than 2048 (the largest union member) will corrupt memory. From here you can execute code or corrupt the `VFYContextStr`, allowing any signature or certificate to verify.

I haven't checked if the same bug affects macOS, IIUC they forked an ancient version of NSS? Maybe you know the right people to ask.

This code seems to have been around for a long time (at least since 2008 or so?)

Oh, I used SHA-1 in my test certificate, but I can't remember if that required a build-time option to enable. It doesn't matter for the bug, so I can make a SHA-256 version, or non-self signed version if that helps.

I'll have a look if this code is used on macOS and reach out to them if it is the case.

At least, indeed, but it might actually be much older...

I am pretty sure it didn't require an option, though in Firefox we might have more guards against using these certificates.

I'll have a look and keep you in the loop ! : ) Thank you !

~~At a glance, Firefox is vulnerable to this in multiple places.~~

Looking closer, since Firefox always specifies `SEC_OID_ANSIX962_EC_PUBLIC_KEY` and only accepts EC keys, it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to this.

@Bob, our current thinking is that Firefox is not affected because of the way mozpkix builds the certificate chains.

Can you please have a look and see how this affects RedHat, so that we can coordinate on which NSS release to target? Thx

@Tavis, from what we could see, it really looks to us like an issue with DSA certs and not an ECDSA ones (title), is that correct or are we missing something obvious? :) Thank you!

Oops, my mistake.

I did a little spelunking in the commit history, you can see the current code starts to take form here:

<https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/diff/6a5aef244b4390570f4066f6e304752217223988/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#l1.114>

That is an accurate refactor of the previous code, so the bug wasn't introduced here (just copied over to the new form).

I think the original code had this bug (from around 2003), and it just survived 20 years of refactoring:

<https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/annotate/41f5eb9e5df23951883ba3243f3ae51550663d77/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#l145>

I'm a bit confused why this wasn't caught earlier, I was doing some (moderately) novel fuzzing, but this doesn't seem like it should have required any new groundbreaking research. Perhaps the difference is that I've been annoying colleagues with ASN.1 encoding questions for a few weeks, and using it to improve my fuzzing :)

Perhaps you've already noticed this, but the exact same bug exists here with SEC\_OID\_PKCS1\_RSA\_PSS\_SIGNATURE:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#484>

I've made a demo certificate, would you like it, or did you already know about it?

This also seems vulnerable, but I think there is no way to reach it from within NSS, because sig is usually NULL:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#698>

But I can see external uses that might be vulnerable:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/modules/libmar/verify/cryptox.c#94>

Because it appears Firefox is not vulnerable to a drive-by attack we're not going to rush this into a Release-candidate respin of Firefox 94. There may be a Firefox 94 point-release in a couple of weeks a fix could go into if necessary, otherwise Firefox 95 seems safe enough. That will give us space to audit for similar occurrences rather than just reacting, and also give us more time to coordinate with Linux distros who may have non-Firefox code that use these signatures. (Firefox may be vulnerable if users explicitly import certs, buried deep in our UI; checking on that)

I'm surprised as well -- we have indeed done targeted cert fuzzing in the past. Currently I believe the only NSS fuzzing is what's being done on oss-fuzz but I don't know what it covers.

Adding Kai because this might have pose a more exposed risk for Thunderbird users if S/MIME supports these signature types. Can you check that out, Kai?

Correct -- not minimizing the badness of this bug, just trying to judge risk/exposure. Landing a patch like this will likely lead to folks scouring the code looking for similar mistakes (as you yourself are doing). If the exploitation risk is "easy drive-by" we could patch what we can immediately, force through an emergency update, and hope for the best. If there are mitigating factors it's better to do a more thorough code review and more testing, and spare the release teams (build, QA, server ops, etc) the stress of an emergency release.

S/MIME is a worrying thought we need to check out. If affected that might be the "drive-by" that raises the alarm level again. It's a bad time for an emergency release for them because we're in the middle of the transition from 78.x releases to 91.x releases, and people hold back.

I've actually been looking into this for a postmortem, I'm trying to figure out how this was missed, here are some of my notes:

---

The easiest way to demonstrate this bug is with RSA-PSS. In fact, just these three commands should work:

> Note: it will take a while to generate a >16000 bit key

```
# We need 16384 bits to overflow the buffer, then 32 + 64 + 64 + 64 bits to reach hashobj,
# which contains function pointers (bigger would work fine too, but takes longer).
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa-pss -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:$((16384 + 32 + 64 + 64 + 64)) -out bigsig.key
# Generate a self signed certificate from that key
$ openssl req -x509 -new -key bigsig.key -subj "/CN=BigSig" -sha256 -out bigsig.cer
# Verify it with NSS...
$ vfychain -a bigsig.cer
Segmentation fault

```

* Was this a recent code change or regression that hadn’t been around long enough to be discovered? **No**, a vulnerable version of the code for DSA was checked in on the [17th October 2003](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/annotate/41f5eb9e5df23951883ba3243f3ae51550663d77/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#l158), and survived nearly 20 years of refactoring.
* Does this bug require a long time to generate a key that triggers the bug? **No**, the example above generates a real key and signature, but it can just be garbage as the overflow happens before the signature check. A few kilobytes of A’s works just fine.
* Does reaching the vulnerable code require some complicated state that fuzzers and static analyzers would have difficulty synthesizing, like hashes or checksums? **No**, it would have to be well-formed DER, that’s about it.
* Is this an uncommon code path? **No**, the main entrypoint for certificate verification in NSS, `CERT_VerifyCertificate()`, is vulnerable. Effectively any use of NSS is affected.

This wasn’t a process failure, the vendor did everything right. Mozilla has a mature, world-class security team. They pioneered [bug bounties](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/) and obsess over [memory safety](https://research.mozilla.org/rust/), fuzzing and [test coverage](https://coverage.moz.tools/).

NSS was one of the very first projects included with [oss-fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/), it was officially supported since at least [October 2014](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/commit/3d325bf20f0b09961b6c7de34aa4da0d16cfa67d) including a collection of custom mutators. Mozilla also fuzz NSS themselves with libFuzzer, and their own [mutator](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/fuzz/asn1_mutators.cc) collection. They also have a [distilled coverage corpus](https://github.com/mozilla/nss-fuzzing-corpus), an extensive testsuite, and nightly ASAN builds.

I'm generally skeptical of static analysis, but this seems like a simple missing bounds check that should be easy to find. Coverity has been monitoring NSS since at least [December 2008](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/nss), and also failed to discover this.

* Did mozilla have good test coverage for the vulnerable areas? [YES](https://coverage.moz.tools/#revision=latest&path=security%2Fnss%2Flib%2Fcryptohi%2Fsecvfy.c&suite=gtest&view=file&line=201).
* Did mozilla/chrome/oss-fuzz have relevant inputs in their fuzz corpus? [YES](https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-coverage/nss/reports/20211027/linux/src/nss/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c.html#L201).
* Is there a mutator capable of extending ASN1\_ITEMs? [YES](https://codereview.chromium.org/1677803002/patch/180001/190008).
* Is the minimum input size to trigger the bug "too big" for libFuzzer mutators to attempt? NO, libFuzzer dynamically adjusts the size based on the coverage corpus. I was able to make a testcase that is just 4397 bytes, and there are 2440 bigger inputs in the nss corpus.
* Is this an intra-object overflow, or other rare form of corruption that ASAN would have difficulty detecting? NO, it's a textbook buffer overflow that ASAN can easily detect.

I guess the conclusion is that you can do everything right and still get bugs like this, because native code is dangerous code.

I don't think it's a good assumption that Firefox is not vulnerable. VFYContext is part of the generic NSS signature processing. Just because the example attack uses signatures in certificates, doesn't mean we can't be forced to verify a bad signature. Namely one can force a bad signature in a middle of an SSL connection.

I recommend we treat is as real and live for Firefox.

Many of us have looked at it by now multiple times and we are getting convinced that, even during a TLS handshake, because of the way we go through moz::pkix, an adversarial certificate wouldn’t lead to trigger the verification function (moz::pkix does not and never had support for DSA nor RSA PSS). Obviously, we are taking this very seriously and will keep doing so as a priority for the next coming days.

The current doubts we have are about a potential issue when a user is performing certain actions in the client certificate context.

We are also making assessments in the context of Addons, Content Signatures, Firefox Accounts and will report back…

I'm not toking about checking Certificate signatures. That's just the example of how to attack this. I'm talking about mangling the DSA signature coming back from an SSL handshake, say in TLS\_DHE\_DSS\_ connection.

The fact that's it's DSA only makes this less of a problem, since it could be that all *DSS* algorithms are off be default...

Bob: The TLS layer doesn't use the `VFY_` abstraction layer (nor `vfy_VerifyData`), they directly use the PK11 functions (e.g. in <https://searchfox.org/nss/source/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c> )

Tavis: Regarding good (fuzz) coverage, this family of functions aren't covered by fuzzed data themselves. That is, you're likely seeing positive fuzzer coverage because of <https://searchfox.org/nss/source/fuzz/tls_server_certs.cc> , but that uses fixed certs, not fuzzed certs. That may explain why you see corpus inputs exercising the code, but failing to find.

FWIW, I put a breakpoint on VFY\_CreateContext with condition `$_any_caller_matches("mozilla::pkix", 50) == 0`. Apart from the matches already mentioned in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1737470#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - Memory Corruption in decodeECorDsaSignature with DSA signatures (and RSA-PSS)") (Manifests, Content Signatures, etc), there were various hits via `ssl_VerifySignedHashesWithPubKey`. I'm not sure I really understand the context though, is that relevant?

Ah, thanks Tavis. Not sure why my code query failed - although it looks like NSS explicitly calls the (not buggy, AIUI) PK11 methods for PSS and DSA.

> Hmm, I think you're right - that seems worth fixing, I'll look into it!

Yeah, right now only a cluster of decode functions are fuzzed with arbitrary inputs, along with the TLS state machine. No signature verification fuzzing happens.

It probably is worth reviving [Bug 1253107](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253107 "NEW - Legacy ASN.1 decoder should offer an option as to whether or not to zero internal memory") as part of that. One element that is new from when I was last fuzzing these was the fuzzer pre processor macro of `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION`, which makes it a bit easier to skip the zeroization without having to worry about the FIPS implications. That should hopefully make these extra functions a bit more reasonable.

> Adding Kai because this might have pose a more exposed risk for Thunderbird users if S/MIME supports these signature types. Can you check that out, Kai?

Thunderbird seems affected, sending an email with a S/MIME signature that contains a malicious certificate is sufficient.

When performing an S/MIME signature verification...

<https://searchfox.org/comm-esr91/rev/cc5a292314d25cc582225fd22a20f7bd3b0f6072/mailnews/extensions/smime/nsCMS.cpp#158>

... one the first thing done is importing all the certificate that are seen in the incoming signature:

<https://searchfox.org/comm-esr91/rev/cc5a292314d25cc582225fd22a20f7bd3b0f6072/mailnews/extensions/smime/nsCMS.cpp#241>

That code wants to import valid certificates, only, and NSS\_CMSSignedData\_ImportCerts calls CERT\_VerifyCert:

<https://searchfox.org/nss/rev/8c23e8e507c132e74fd5b98e472b76200b9a6984/lib/smime/cmssigdata.c#591>

I don't see any filtering for signature algorithms prior to doing the above, apparently any incoming certificate will be fed to CERT\_VerifyCert.

Note that there's code later that wants to obtain the validity of the signature. While that code also eventually calls CERT\_VerifyCert (through NSS\_CMSSignedData\_VerifySignerInfo and NSS\_CMSSignerInfo\_VerifyCertificate), that code isn't executed unless a check with the mozilla::pkix verifier reports the signing certificate as currently valid. If mozilla::pkix causes certificates reported in this bug as invalid, then we won't reach the CERT\_VerifyCert code path.

We probably cannot skip the initial call to NSS\_CMSSignedData\_ImportCerts, the certs are imported to ensure they will be available during verification, for building the chain of the signing certificate.

If mozilla::pkix verification detects/rejects the bad certificates, we could modify the initial importing to use the same strategy, call mozilla::pkix first. Avoding to require a new API in a chemspill, we'd have to copy the implementation of NSS\_CMSSignedData\_ImportCerts into Thunderbird, and tweak it accordingly.

Kai: I made you a test email, I just inserted my demo cert into an example s/mime pkcs7 blob I found on github, can you try it? (I'm not really familiar with Thunderbird sorry)

I found the original email [here](https://github.com/fastmail/authentication_milter_smime/blob/master/t/data/example/smime.eml), if the syntax is bad, maybe you can try fixing it up (I just manually patched it).

Thanks Tavis! I will test very soon, and I'm making this top priority, will spend today on this issue.

Thunderbird technical manager mkmelin asked to be CC'ed to this bug, but we probably want to keep the CC list at a minimum right now. I guess at this time, accidentally spreading information about this bug is the highest risk.

I think I have good news for the Thunderbird situation, but step by step:

The attached S/MIME test email crashes Thunderbird in CERT\_VerifyCert, so it's confirmed TB is vulnerable.

Then I modified TB to test the theory from [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=1737470#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - Memory Corruption in decodeECorDsaSignature with DSA signatures (and RSA-PSS)").

For each cert that NSS wants to import, the test code starts by calling mozpkix::VerifyCert. If that fails, we skip import (and thereby skip CERT\_VerifyCert).

This doesn't crash. We don't crash in the import step. And we don't crash in the signature verify step (which already calls mozpkix::VerifyCert prior to calling CERT\_VerifyCert).

The patch I have has to copy a few functions from NSS to Thunderbird code. But it should be safe to copy those implementation details, we can assume they won't change on the stable TB 91 branch, and for comm-central, we can plan to undo that shortly afterwards. The reason is that we cannot easily add new NSS APIs on the stable branch, and copying the functions avoids new APIs on the stable branch.

We could add this patch to Thunderbird using a decoy bug.

We could file a new bug, which says we want to perform some additional verification prior to importing certs, for consistency with the existing signature validation code.

I think the decoy bug could be public, and we'd explain as little as possible. I'd talk to a Thunderbird reviewer in private to get them to confirm the Thunderbird code change.

The actual review could happen here (or, if you prefer to keep this bug small, file a separate security sensitive bug for the TB patch review discussion.)

I'm attaching the patch in here, so you can have a first look.

My only remaining question at this point is:

Is mozpkix known to avoid the crash, or are we just lucky that it doesn't crash with this example message?

re: [Comment #33](/show_bug.cgi?id=1737470#c33 "RESOLVED FIXED - Memory Corruption in decodeECorDsaSignature with DSA signatures (and RSA-PSS)")

`mozpkix` appears to avoid this issue because:

* It does not accept DSA certificates
* It does not accept RSA-PSS certificates

The relevant code for verifying signatures is <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/daa5c195e5efe45a63bf79f97ae77419b16f62f1/security/nss/lib/mozpkix/lib/pkixnss.cpp#84-100> - those are the only two entry points into the [affected function](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/daa5c195e5efe45a63bf79f97ae77419b16f62f1/security/nss/lib/mozpkix/lib/pkixnss.cpp#42-47,72-74)

That's because these are the only two algorithms `mozpkix` allows through its [embedder interface](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/daa5c195e5efe45a63bf79f97ae77419b16f62f1/security/nss/lib/mozpkix/include/pkix/pkixtypes.h#303-311,321-329)

|  | |

So I think if you're looking at taking that route for TB (routing through `mozpkix`), the question will be: are you comfortable changing the supported signature algorithms to those of `mozpkix`, or will that be a regression for your TB use cases?

Actually:

Currently, when verifying the certificate that was used to sign an email, Thunderbird *already* starts by using mozpkix to verify the signing certificate:

<https://searchfox.org/comm-esr91/rev/cc5a292314d25cc582225fd22a20f7bd3b0f6072/mailnews/extensions/smime/nsCMS.cpp#261>

If mozpkix cannot verify the signing certificate, TB will treat the signature as invalid.

I don't see bug reports in the Security:S/MIME component mentioning the term DSA. It looks like nobody has complained that S/MIME signatures from DSA certificates are always shown as invalid.

The patch here will prevent the import of DSA certificates that are received as part of an S/MIME message. If that's the only path a user uses to obtain encryption certificates, then the patch will also prevent the import of encryption certificates. This is a regression.

I think I'm willing to accept that. Users could still import such certificates using other approaches, e.g. manual certificate manager import, or downloading from LDAP.

The highest priority for me is stopping the drive-by attack, having users at risk simply by receiving an email. If we learn that we have TB users that depend on DSA certificates, we could remove this workaround, once NSS with the crash fix is ready.

FWIW, here are my current notes on what I think went wrong with the fuzzing. If you would like to see a full draft of my postmortem please let me know (it's in a google doc, but I can send you a PDF).

---

How did extensive, customized fuzzing with impressive metrics fail to discover this bug?

* **Issue #1** *Missing end-to-end testing.*

NSS is a [highly modular](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_API_Guidelines) library. This layered design is reflected in the [fuzzing](https://searchfox.org/nss/source/fuzz/), as each component is fuzzed individually. For example, the QuickDER decoder is tested [extensively](https://searchfox.org/nss/source/fuzz/quickder_target.cc), but the fuzzer simply [creates and discards](https://searchfox.org/nss/rev/5f2fa238b58c9158a52c0681ca2a67958a353082/fuzz/quickder_target.cc#72) objects and never uses them.

```
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
 char *dest[2048];

 for (auto tpl : templates) {
   PORTCheapArenaPool pool;
   SECItem buf = {siBuffer, const_cast<unsigned char *>(Data),
                  static_cast<unsigned int>(Size)};

   PORT_InitCheapArena(&pool, DER_DEFAULT_CHUNKSIZE);
   (void)SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem(&pool.arena, dest, tpl, &buf);
   PORT_DestroyCheapArena(&pool);
 }

```
> Fig n. The QuickDER fuzzer simply creates and discards objects. This verifies the ASN.1 parsing, but not the resulting objects.

This fuzzer might have produced a `SECKEY_DSA_PublicKey` that could have reached the vulnerable code, but as it was never used to verify a signature the bug was never triggered.

* **Issue #2** *Arbitrary size limits.*

If the QuickDER fuzzing target had attempted to call cryptographic APIs with fuzzed objects, this bug would still not have been discovered because there is an arbitrary size limit of [2048 bytes](https://searchfox.org/nss/rev/5f2fa238b58c9158a52c0681ca2a67958a353082/fuzz/quickder_target.cc#65) in the created fuzzed objects.

This choice is arbitrary, there is no such limit within NSS, many structures and templates can legitimately exceed this. As the key size necessary to trigger this bug must exceed 2048 bytes, even if libFuzzer had produced ASN.1 that would have triggered the bug, QuickDER would have failed to decode it.

It makes sense to reflect the real limitations of NSS while fuzzing, rather than arbitrarily chosen limits. In fact, it probably makes sense to exceed the limitations of NSS. In this case, in order to trigger an ASAN warning at least 24 additional bytes were required to exceed the bounds of the heap allocation. While a smaller overflow would still be dangerous, these [intra-object](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerIntraObjectOverflow) overflows are invisible to ASAN.

* **Issue #3** *Misleading metrics.*

The NSS fuzzers are represented in single combined coverage metrics by oss-fuzz, rather than their individual coverage. This data proved misleading, the vulnerable code is fuzzed extensively but by fuzzers that could not possibly generate a relevant input.

This is because the fuzzers like the [tls\_server\_target](https://searchfox.org/nss/source/fuzz/tls_server_target.cc) use fixed, hardcoded [certificates](https://searchfox.org/nss/source/fuzz/tls_server_certs.cc) while they fuzz TLS messages and protocol states.

I'm wrong about this, the limit is higher and on the libFuzzer input not output - Ryan pointed out my error. I think the other points remain valid!

I know Red Hat uses NSS and Java in FIPS mode, I suspect Oracle does as well (they do have their own NSS FIPS validation). That being said, I'm not sure FIPS will affect the outcome. Red Hat disables DSA by policy (by default) on all their libraries in RHEL-8 even in FIPS mode.

I'm mildly surprised that mozpkix hasn't grown RSA-PSS support yet with the push to move off of RSA-PKCS.

Also, I don't have much information about Oracle's use of NSS. All I know is that they forked server products in the past that use NSS. We have a private NSS discussion list, and we used to have someone from Oracle on that list. If you have trouble finding a contact at Oracle, we could try asking on that list for current users of NSS at Oracle.

Dan, do you agree with immediate landing of the Thunderbird patch in [bug 1738501](/show_bug.cgi?id=1738501 "RESOLVED FIXED - Automatic S/MIME cert import should use additional verification using mozilla::pkix") into comm-central, comm-beta and comm-esr91 ?

I'd say it should be fine, it shouldn't give any clue why the additional check is done.

I have tested that the patch prevents the crash in c-c and esr91.

S/MIME automated tests executed locally for comm-esr91 still pass.

It will work better as a "decoy" if it's not a hidden bug. Anyone object to that? The bug doesn't reveal as much as the patch itself does, which is minimal (a refactoring to add a call to mozilla::pkix). As djackson pointed out in slack, the last-minute and hacky expedient nature of incorporating the NSS routines might raise eyebrows anyway. At least if the bug isn't hidden folks relying on automated scanners won't be prompted for a closer human look.

Yes. At the moment Thunderbird users are at the most immediate risk from this bug as far as we've found.

It was wsmwk (not on cc) who had suggested for the decoy bug to be hidden. But it was only a suggestion. If we have good reason to unhide it, it should be fine with him.

The CryptoEng team have been looking at this for the past few days. We're still crossing the t's and dotting the i's but have some preliminary findings to share:

**DSA**

We believe this was introduced in NSS 3.14, released October 2012. We've tested 3.13.6 and 3.11.9 and neither appear to be vulnerable. Although the vulnerable code takes shape much earlier, the len parameter to `decodeECorDSASignature` is hardcoded to 40 until [revision 10393](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/diff/10393/security/nss/lib/cryptohi/seckey.c#l1.63) / [Bug 475578](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475578).

Firefox removed support for DSA in TLS in 2014 and mozilla::pkix has never supported DSA certificates so it is not impacted. Similarly, the default NSS policies shipped with Ubuntu and Red Hat disable DSA. However, other users of NSS which haven't disabled DSA by policy are likely to be impacted.

**RSA-PSS**

RSA-PSS support was introduced in NSS 3.34, released November 2017. Whilst RSA-PSS is used in Firefox, the impact appears to be quite limited:

* Update Signing - Not vulnerable, pinned to RSA PKCS #1.
* Content Signing - Not vulnerable, pinned to ECDSA.
* CRL, OCSP, Certificate Transparency - Not vulnerable, pinned to ECDSA and RSA PKCS #1.
* TLS - Not vulnerable, moz::pkix doesn't support RSA-PSS certificates and the TLS implementation dispatches RSA-PSS signatures to `PK11_VerifyWithMechanism` which avoids the vulnerable code.
* Addon Signing - Not vulnerable, but a close run. Starting from [OpenSignedAppFile](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/apps/AppSignatureVerification.cpp#1261) the certificate chain is first verified by moz::pkix which doesn't accept RSA-PSS signatures. Consequently the signing key must be an RSA key provided by Mozilla of the correct size. So whilst an attacker can append an RSA-PSS signature to the addon, allegedly from the Mozilla-provided pubkey, the signature verification uses the public key provided length and so is not vulnerable.

However, if a user manually imports a TLS Certificate (e.g. for client auth) via Settings->View Certificates->Import, it calls into [ImportPKCS12File](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/ssl/nsNSSCertificateDB.cpp#798) which will attempt to verify the imported file with either a hmac or [signature](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pkcs12/p12d.c#1487). We assume this is exploitable if the attacker can convince the user to manually install a malicious certificate.

As RSA-PSS is typically enabled by default, consumers of NSS as a library are almost certainly impacted. A non-comprehensive list of believed-vulnerable functions is attached. It includes CMS / SMIME, PKCS #7, PKCS #12, X.509, OCSP and CRL functionality.

There's another email client that uses NSS for S/MIME and is vulnerable, too. I've just tested that Gnome Evolution on Linux crashes with Tavis' test email, and it crashes below the call to CERT\_VerifyCert (in VFY\_Begin).

Regarding Evolution, I just read [comment 50](/show_bug.cgi?id=1737470#c50 "RESOLVED FIXED - Memory Corruption in decodeECorDsaSignature with DSA signatures (and RSA-PSS)") from Dennis. If RHEL disables DSA, then Evolution on RHEL is likely not affected.

However, other Linux distributions that ship Evolution are affected. I've tested on Debian.

As I just released NSS 3.72 (2021-10-28), and looking at the calendar [0], there are two releases that could work well for landing this fix:

NSS 3.73 on 2021-12-02 - or - NSS 3.74 on 2022-01-06.

I currently lean towards aiming at NSS 3.73 which leaves us with 4 weeks to take additional disclosure actions.

In that scenario, we could notify the distros list on November 22nd (10 days prior the release).

Does that seem reasonable?

When do you intend to create the public commit?

IIUC, you suggest: 2021-12-02

When do you intend to provide the NSS patch for the distro people?

Do you need to do that on the day you announce it to the distro list?

Or is it sufficient to do that by the end of the 14 day period?

As soon as you provide the patch to the distro people, you might see public package builds that contain the patch, so this is equivalent to publishing the fix, and therefore I think that you could publicly commit to NSS on the same day as giving to distro people.

Is it necessary to immediately release beta and esr91 immediately after you make the public commit?

If yes, the suggested date 2021-12-02 may not be ideal, because it's too close to the scheduled release on 2021-12-07, and it might be a challenge for release engineering to handle two releases within a week.

Regardless of the timing for mozilla-central and a new NSS version, you might require at least two .x releases for stable NSS releases, for the one used by Firefox Beta, and for the one used by Firefox ESR 91.x.

[Edit]:

~~If you do it in the middle of the regular 4 week update cycle, then you don't need to immediately create the next NSS release, it's sufficient to have it in NSS trunk and in FF nightly.~~

With the following schedule you'd also require an additional NSS release for the latest FF release.

If the patch can be ready soon, then you could use the following schedule, assuming Firefox releng would agree with it, and also assuming that you can ask distros to delay building public packages until 2 days before the end of the 14 days period:

* 2021-11-09: announce to distros list
* 2021-11-21:

  public commit to NSS, give patch to distro list,

  create release tags NSS 3.68.x, NSS 3.71.x, NSS 3.72.x
* 2021-11-23: release FF 94.0.x, FF Beta 95.x, FF ESR 91.3.x,

  and announce the NSS 3.68.x, NSS 3.71.x and NSS 3.72.x releases

Linux distributions will need to patch their older system NSS releases. For example Debian 10 uses NSS 3.42, and Ubuntu 20.04 uses NSS 3.49, Debian 11 uses NSS 3.61.

Updating NSS is the only known defense for Gnome Evolution, to protect it from being exploitable by received email.

Will the patch to NSS easily apply to all past versions? The answer to this influences how much time the distros need to prepare a merged NSS.

For the current WIP, it seems easy, the patch seems to directly apply to NSS 3.42.

[Edit]: Added need for 3.68.x

I think there's no need to worry, the list members are used to handling embargoed security issues and they take this seriously. They will just make sure they have packages and advisories ready to for their users at the agreed upon date.

You can read about some of the policies [here](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#list-policy-and-instructions-for-members).

Always useful, thanks for your thoughts Kai ! : )

I am not yet able to give you a complete story for the timeline as I am still discussing the possibilities with Fx Release Management. However it looks like we are moving towards a solution that is quite close to what you suggested above and where Firefox release and ESR are patched roughly at the same time as we make the fix public. I'll get back to all of you here as soon as I know more...

Are we OK having the distros ship fixes, with Firefox fixing the issue 5 days later? That's essentially what would happen with a Dec 02 date. We could do an RC2 and hold off on the ESR 91.4 RC until the patches land on that date (for a Dec 7 release), but we wouldn't be able to get a new 94.0.x update and shipped then with all the release and QA teams focused on the Dec 7 releases.

We don't have a "94.0.x" update release already planned, at least not in a reliable enough way we could pin a distro disclosure timeline to, and the impact to Firefox doesn't appear severe enough to force a chemspill on its own.

Timing aside, The versions I'd like to see fixed are Firefox 95.0 (Release) and Firefox ESR 91.4. it looks like the distro list disclosure rules would consider us landing patches as a "disclosure", and in order to ship in those releases we would have to make builds on that Dec 2 date at the latest.

If we have an alternate way to disable the functionality outside of NSS that doesn't hint at the problem then Dec 7 would be a better disclosure date. We could have included the non-revealing Firefox patch in those releases, and then release NSS point releases with the patch on that date. The NSS patches wouldn't be in the Firefox releases, but they could than land on Nightly and Beta.

As Dennis mentioned in [comment 50](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1737470#c50), we were initially concerned that Firefox was vulnerable through the client certificate import dialog.

I've reviewed the relevant function, `nsPKCS12Blob::ImportFromFile` , and found that it is not vulnerable. The attacker would have to provide an RFC 7292 PFX structure with a zero-length macData field ([because of this branch](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pkcs12/p12d.c#1478)). Zero-length macData fields are allowed by the standard, but not by [the ASN.1 template](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pkcs12/p12tmpl.c#196) that `SEC_PKCS12DecoderStart` selects for parsing PFX structures. So it's impossible to hit the vulnerable `SEC_PKCS7VerifySignature` path in `SEC_PKCS12DecoderVerify` when the input `SEC_PKCS12DecoderContext` is initialized using `SEC_PKCS12DecoderStart`, as it is in `nsPKCS12Blob::ImportFromFile`.

Our current assessment is that Firefox is not vulnerable to this bug, and a separate non-revealing Firefox patch is not necessary.

Hi all,

If we are confident - say mid-next week - that we identified the few actors that we want to notify early and have a valid patch, we could be ok for including the fix in releases of NSS in this cycle (December 2nd). In that case we could selectively disclose on Wed Nov 24th which is a one week notice.

Bob, Kai, can you confirm that there is no blockage for you if we attempt to fix and publicly disclose for the next NSS release on Dec 2nd and are we ok with only having the fix in NSS 3.73+ and NSS 3.68 ESR ?

I've asked Dennis to take over coordination of the disclosure on our side and he will likely provide a status update here soon.

My biggest issue with the plan is Nov 24th is the day before thanksgiving. For me, we are trying to get embargoed builds done this week, but for anyone that gets noticed on Nov24th, you are generating a bad Thanksgiving Holiday for them, It would probably be better to give notice after Thanksgiving and push the NSS release cycle out one week.

No block from Thunderbird perspective, we have already shipped the workaround in release 91.3.0 and beta 95.0b1.

> ... and are we ok with only having the fix in NSS 3.73+ and NSS 3.68 ESR ?

The NSS team usually didn't provide support for older NSS versions - but everyone distributing older NSS versions must apply the required patch. It should be made clear which patch needs to be applied. It should be made clear that e.g. everyone distributing Gnome Evolution is highly vulnerable and needs to ship NSS with the fixed patch ASAP (on the coordinated date).

Huzaifa, yes, but the distros are notified on the 24th they don't really have a full week to get their code together and get builds ready. Also I'm off on Thanksgiving, so we need to get the release machinery running *this week* or there will be no one at Red Hat to create the builds for QA, since already know about this.

Has Mozilla/Red Hat allocated a CVE for this issue? I think Huzaifa might know for Red Hat.

I would prefer not to rush all the other distros - Red Hat has a big head start - I imagine Debian and others will want time to do some back porting and can't just apply the patch.

Is there any objection to informing the vendors list tomorrow? I can take care of letting them know. That will still be 14 days until the 2nd.

Mozilla will allocate. Dan, can you handle this?

Please don't. I'd also rather that the disclosure comes from Mozilla as this is a good reflex for us to exercise.

Thanks for the feedback Kai & Bob.

Let's avoid Thanksgiving entirely and move the disclosure date back to Monday 29th of November and release the embargo on Thursday the 9th of December. This means we can include a finalised patch with the disclosure and give everybody 8 working days to get their ducks in a row.

Benjamin is okay with pushing the NSS release date to the 9th of Dec and it sounds like this is also fine for Thunderbird and Red Hat.

There is an issue here, our (Project Zero) policies dictate what I'm required to do 30 days after any "fix" is "made available". I understand the Thunderbird patch was not a complete fix, but if I accept that interpretation, then other (less cooperative) vendors can game our policies by releasing partial fixes and then blocking public disclosure. I would really prefer to avoid setting that precedent, not all vendors are as diligent as Mozilla.

It would really make my life a lot simpler if we try to keep it before the 4th.

If we have to keep this early of a date, then we should definitely notify other distros early. From a practical matter you really need to assume holidays are noops. Yes distros can handle having to cobble something together over the holidays, or just flat out saying we aren't going to make the embargo date for the release, but artificially generating such a condition is very unfriendly.

I do not know how the Thunderbird workaround looks like; if it's in the NSS side or the Thunderbird side. If it's in Thunderbird side, we can't really say that a fix was made available to users of curl compiled against NSS or Apache mod\_nss (among others).

We don’t expect any special treatment from Project Zero. If you are notifying us that you consider the Thunderbird decoy patch to be a 'broadly available fix' then, in line with your published policy, we will publicly disclose on the next working day after the 4th (aka December 6th).

That said, I don’t agree the fix is ‘broadly available’ as there are many downstream applications which have no available fix. Mozilla would like to give those maintainers as much as possible to integrate the patch and backport it to their supported versions. In both cases, we plan to privately disclose on November 29th (the Monday after Thanksgiving).

I understand, but you can imagine how a vendor could release a patch for their main product, and then demand no advisory is published because they haven't patched some minor product. You have to understand that I deal with a lot of uncooperative vendors who want to argue about policies to hide security issues from users.

You mean want to inform the distros list on November 29th? That's okay with me, although I really think a few more days would be appreciated if you can swing it.

It's a balance: to give them more time then either we're ruining Thanksgiving for US-based folks by warning them right before a major travel holiday, or we're going even further over your deadline by releasing later :-( And if the advisory has already been published releasing later isn't giving anyone more time.

Fair enough. In my experience, I think most teams (even volunteer teams, e.g. Debian) are globally distributed and wouldn't be annoyed with the extra time. This is just my opinion, so long as it's under the deadline, the choice is yours!

As an apart, are you planning to do a technical blog about this on the project zero site?

Everyone should be aware already but commenting here just in case...

The embargo was broken a few hours ago so - in agreement with the Linux distros list - the new public disclosure is set to: December 1st, 16:00 UTC

Thanks Benjamin for the response. We are looking at the issue in Red Hat. It looks like a tooling issue. The builds were properly marked as embargoed in our private tree, but the centos stream tools still automatically pulled them into the public tree. Clearly we need to fix what went wrong.

Is there going to be a mozilla advisory or nss release notes, or any way to know the issue is "really" public now?

We are gonna push the commits+tags to the NSS repo, effectively making NSS 3.73.0 and NSS 3.68.1 ESR public.

The archives are gonna be uploaded to the Mozilla FTP server as usual and we will email dev-tech-crypto and provide an advisory shortly after.

Note that because the timeline changed, 3.73.0 contains the fix.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: critical bug for Thunderbird
* **User impact if declined**: potentially exploitable crash using yet undiscovered attack vectors
* **Fix Landed on Version**:
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The risk seems minimal for Firefox, because apparently it doesn't use the modified APIs.

  The additional safety checks are desired for Thunderbird.

Approved for TB 91.4.0 build2. As has been discussed previously, we're not planning to respin the Firefox 91.4.0esr build for this, so this change will ride with the 91.5.0esr release shipping alongside Firefox 96 in January.

Dennis: Looking at this from a perspective of writing advisories for the upcoming release of Firefox 96 and ESR 91.5. My understanding is that these releases are marked as "fixed" because we are taking the updated NSS version, but they are not technically affected by this security bug.

Is there a local / self-exploit scenario that we need to take into account though?

Not as far as we're aware. The vulnerable code can't be triggered from Firefox.
