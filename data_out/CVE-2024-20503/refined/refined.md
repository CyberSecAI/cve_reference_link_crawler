- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper storage of an unencrypted registry key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to the storage of sensitive information in cleartext within a registry key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in cleartext.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system is required. An attacker can view or query the vulnerable registry key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated, low-privileged local user on the affected system.
