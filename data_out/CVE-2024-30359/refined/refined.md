          "vulnerability_details": {
            "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the handling of 3D objects in AcroForms. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
             "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
            "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with ability to create a malicious PDF document."
          }

               "Root cause of vulnerability": "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Out-of-Bounds Read/Write vulnerability and crash when handing certain U3D files, Doc objects, or 3D objects in AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code or disclose information. This occurs as the application encounters an infinite loop when traversing objects in a circular reference, reads or writes data beyond the boundaries of an allocated object/buffer, or converts and uses the pointer that is discrepant with the object type.",
