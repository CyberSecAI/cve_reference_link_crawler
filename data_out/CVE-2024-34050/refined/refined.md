{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of indication messages, specifically when processing slice bounds. This leads to an out-of-range panic due to unexpected data formats.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Slice bounds out-of-range panic vulnerability in `reader.go` at line 32.",
    "Slice bounds out-of-range panic vulnerability in `reader.go` at line 14."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerabilities can cause a panic, leading to a denial of service. Specifically, the program will terminate abruptly due to an unrecoverable error.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting specific indication messages with unexpected formats. The provided examples in the comment showcase how these malformed messages could be structured.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted indication messages to the application."
