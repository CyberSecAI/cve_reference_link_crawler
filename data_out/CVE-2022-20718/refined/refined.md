Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incomplete sanitization of parameters passed during the activation of an application within the Cisco IOx application hosting environment. Specifically, the `interface` field within the `package.yaml` file is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Parameter Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the 'interface' field allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into this field.
- **Command Injection:** The injected commands are then executed by the underlying operating system by passing to the shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as *root* on the underlying host operating system. This grants them full control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Network:** The attacker exploits the API which is exposed via the network.
- **Crafted Payload:** The attacker needs to deploy and activate an application with a crafted activation payload file (`package.yaml`) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to deploy and activate applications within the Cisco IOx environment.
- **Cisco IOx API access**: The attacker must have access to the Cisco IOx API in order to deploy and activate the application.
- **Crafted Payload Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious IOx package (specifically `package.yaml`) with a command injection in the `interface` field.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory explicitly states there are no workarounds available. Disabling the IOx application hosting environment is mentioned as a mitigation rather than a workaround.
- The content provides more detail on the exploitation of the vulnerability than the official CVE description.
