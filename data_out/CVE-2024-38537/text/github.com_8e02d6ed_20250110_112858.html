### Description Of Changes

No need to continue supporting browsers without `fetch` capabilities.

See <https://caniuse.com/?search=fetch>

### Code Changes

* Remove polyfill that was used to supplement `fetch` when browsers didn't support it.

### Steps to Confirm

* For the scope of this change, we only need to ensure that no regressions occur using your default / standard browser and all pre-existing functionality with the cookie banner is not broken.

### Pre-Merge Checklist

* All CI Pipelines Succeeded
* Issue Requirements are Met
* Update `CHANGELOG.md`

Sorry, something went wrong.

Makes sense. `window.fetch` is fully supported, so this is basically an unused code branch anyways 😄
