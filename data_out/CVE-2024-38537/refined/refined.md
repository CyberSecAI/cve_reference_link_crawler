  "CVE-2024-38537": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the polyfill.io library in the fides.js script. The polyfill.io domain was compromised and used to inject malicious scripts into web pages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of a compromised third-party library (polyfill.io) which became a supply chain attack vector.",
		"Lack of integrity checks on the fetched polyfill code.",
         "Insecure inclusion of external scripts."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allowed for arbitrary code execution on client-side devices, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites or other forms of malware injection.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromised third-party domain (`cdn.polyfill.io`)",
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker required control over the `cdn.polyfill.io` domain or the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to inject malicious code."
