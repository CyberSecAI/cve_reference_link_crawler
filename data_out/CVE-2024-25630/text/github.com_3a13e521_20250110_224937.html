# Unencrypted ingress/health traffic when using Wireguard transparent encryption

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-7496-fgv9-xw82
Feb 20, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

>= 1.14.0, < 1.14.7

## Patched versions

1.14.7

## Description

### Impact

For Cilium users who are using CRDs to store Cilium state (the default configuration) and [Wireguard transparent encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#encryption-wg), responses from pods to the Ingress and health endpoints are not encrypted. Traffic from the Ingress and health endpoints to pods is not affected by this issue. The health endpoint is only used for Cilium's internal health checks.

### Patches

This issue affects Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.7.

This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.7.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this issue - affected users are encouraged to upgrade.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@gandro](https://github.com/gandro) for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

If you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
