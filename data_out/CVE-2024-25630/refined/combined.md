# WireGuard Transparent Encryption[](#wireguard-transparent-encryption "Permalink to this heading")

This guide explains how to configure Cilium with transparent encryption of
traffic between Cilium-managed endpoints using [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/).

Video

Aside from this guide, you can also watch [eCHO episode 3: WireGuard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-awkPi3D60E&t=475s) on how
WireGuard can encrypt network traffic.

When WireGuard is enabled in Cilium, the agent running on each cluster node
will establish a secure WireGuard tunnel between it and all other known nodes
in the cluster. Each node automatically creates its own encryption key-pair and
distributes its public key via the `network.cilium.io/wg-pub-key` annotation
in the Kubernetes `CiliumNode` custom resource object. Each node’s public key
is then used by other nodes to decrypt and encrypt traffic from and to
Cilium-managed endpoints running on that node.

Packets are not encrypted when they are destined to the same node from which
they were sent. This behavior is intended. Encryption would provide no benefits
in that case, given that the raw traffic can be observed on the node anyway.

The WireGuard tunnel endpoint is exposed on UDP port `51871` on each node. If
you run Cilium in an environment that requires firewall rules to enable
connectivity, you will have to ensure that all Cilium cluster nodes can reach
each other via that port.

Note

When running in tunnel routing mode, pod to pod traffic is encapsulated twice.
It is first sent to the VXLAN / Geneve tunnel interface, and then subsequently
also encapsulated by the WireGuard tunnel.

## Enable WireGuard in Cilium[](#enable-wireguard-in-cilium "Permalink to this heading")

Before you enable WireGuard in Cilium, please ensure that the Linux distribution
running on your cluster nodes has support for WireGuard in kernel mode
(i.e. `CONFIG_WIREGUARD=m` on Linux 5.6 and newer, or via the out-of-tree
WireGuard module on older kernels).
See [WireGuard Installation](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for details
on how to install the kernel module on your Linux distribution.

If your kernel or distribution does not support WireGuard, Cilium agent can be
configured to fall back on the user-space implementation via the
`--enable-wireguard-userspace-fallback` flag. When this flag is enabled and
Cilium detects that the kernel has no native support for WireGuard, it
will fallback on the `wireguard-go` user-space implementation of WireGuard.
When running the user-space implementation, encryption and decryption of packets
is performed by the `cilium-agent` process. As a consequence, connectivity
between Cilium-managed endpoints will be unavailable whenever the
`cilium-agent` process is restarted, such as during upgrades or configuration
changes. Running WireGuard in user-space mode is therefore not recommended for
production workloads that require high availability.

Cilium CLIHelm

If you are deploying Cilium with the Cilium CLI, pass the following
options:

```
cilium install --version 1.16.5    --set encryption.enabled=true    --set encryption.type=wireguard
```

If you are deploying Cilium with Helm by following
[Installation using Helm](../../../installation/k8s-install-helm/#k8s-install-helm), pass the following options:

```
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --version 1.16.5 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set encryption.enabled=true \
  --set encryption.type=wireguard
```

WireGuard may also be enabled manually by setting setting the
`enable-wireguard: true` option in the Cilium `ConfigMap` and restarting
each Cilium agent instance.

Note

When running with the CNI chaining (e.g., [AWS VPC CNI plugin](../../../installation/cni-chaining-aws-cni/#chaining-aws-cni)), set the
Helm option `cni.enableRouteMTUForCNIChaining` to `true` to force Cilium
to set a correct MTU for Pods. Otherwise, Pod traffic encrypted with
WireGuard might get fragmented, which can lead to a network performance
degradation.

## Validate the Setup[](#validate-the-setup "Permalink to this heading")

Run a `bash` shell in one of the Cilium pods with
`kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti ds/cilium -- bash` and execute the following
commands:

1. Check that WireGuard has been enabled (number of peers should correspond to
   a number of nodes subtracted by one):

   ```
   cilium-dbg status | grep Encryption

   Encryption: Wireguard [cilium_wg0 (Pubkey: <..>, Port: 51871, Peers: 2)]

   ```
2. Install tcpdump

   ```
   apt-get update
   apt-get -y install tcpdump

   ```
3. Check that traffic is sent via the `cilium_wg0` tunnel device:

   ```
   tcpdump -n -i cilium_wg0

   tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
   listening on cilium_wg0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), capture size 262144 bytes

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Permalink to this heading")

When troubleshooting dropped or unencrypted packets between pods, the following
commands can be helpful:

```
# From node A:
cilium-dbg debuginfo --output json | jq .encryption
{
  "wireguard": {
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "listen-port": 51871,
        "name": "cilium_wg0",
        "peer-count": 1,
        "peers": [
          {
            "allowed-ips": [
              "10.154.1.107/32",
              "10.154.1.195/32"
            ],
            "endpoint": "192.168.61.12:51871",
            "last-handshake-time": "2021-05-05T12:31:24.418Z",
            "public-key": "RcYfs/GEkcnnv6moK5A1pKnd+YYUue21jO9I08Bv0zo="
          }
        ],
        "public-key": "DrAc2EloK45yqAcjhxerQKwoYUbLDjyrWgt9UXImbEY="
      }
    ]
  }
}
# From node B:
cilium-dbg debuginfo --output json | jq .encryption
{
  "wireguard": {
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "listen-port": 51871,
        "name": "cilium_wg0",
        "peer-count": 1,
        "peers": [
          {
            "allowed-ips": [
              "10.154.2.103/32",
              "10.154.2.142/32"
            ],
            "endpoint": "192.168.61.11:51871",
            "last-handshake-time": "2021-05-05T12:31:24.631Z",
            "public-key": "DrAc2EloK45yqAcjhxerQKwoYUbLDjyrWgt9UXImbEY="
          }
        ],
        "public-key": "RcYfs/GEkcnnv6moK5A1pKnd+YYUue21jO9I08Bv0zo="
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

For pod to pod packets to be successfully encrypted and decrypted, the following
must hold:

> * WireGuard public key of a remote node in the `peers[*].public-key` section
>   matches the actual public key of the remote node (`public-key` retrieved via
>   the same command on the remote node).
> * `peers[*].allowed-ips` should contain a list of pod IP addresses running
>   on the remote.

## Cluster Mesh[](#cluster-mesh "Permalink to this heading")

WireGuard enabled Cilium clusters can be connected via [Multi-Cluster (Cluster Mesh)](../../../network/clustermesh/intro/#cluster-mesh). The
`clustermesh-apiserver` will forward the necessary WireGuard public keys
automatically to remote clusters.
In such a setup, it is important to note that all participating clusters must
have WireGuard encryption enabled, i.e. mixed mode is currently not supported.
In addition, UDP traffic between nodes of different clusters on port `51871`
must be allowed.

## Node-to-Node Encryption (beta)[](#node-to-node-encryption-beta "Permalink to this heading")

By default, WireGuard-based encryption only encrypts traffic between Cilium-managed
pods. To enable node-to-node encryption, which additionally also encrypts
node-to-node, pod-to-node and node-to-pod traffic, use the following configuration
options:

Cilium CLIHelm

If you are deploying Cilium with the Cilium CLI, pass the following
options:

```
cilium install --version 1.16.5    --set encryption.enabled=true    --set encryption.type=wireguard    --set encryption.nodeEncryption=true
```

If you are deploying Cilium with Helm by following
[Installation using Helm](../../../installation/k8s-install-helm/#k8s-install-helm), pass the following options:

```
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --version 1.16.5 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set encryption.enabled=true \
  --set encryption.type=wireguard \
  --set encryption.nodeEncryption=true
```

Warning

Cilium automatically disables node-to-node encryption from and to
Kubernetes control-plane nodes, i.e. any node with the
`node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` label will opt-out of node-to-node
encryption.

This is done to ensure worker nodes are always able to communicate with the
Kubernetes API to update their WireGuard public keys. With node-to-node
encryption enabled, the connection to the kube-apiserver would also be
encrypted with WireGuard. This creates a bootstrapping problem where the
connection used to update the WireGuard public key is itself encrypted with
the public key about to be replaced.
This is problematic if a node needs to change its public key, for example
because it generated a new private key after a node reboot or node
re-provisioning.

Therefore, by not encrypting the connection from and to the kube-apiserver
host network with WireGuard, we ensure that worker nodes are
never accidentally locked out from the control plane. Note that even if
WireGuard node-to-node encryption is disabled on those nodes, the Kubernetes
control-plane itself is usually still encrypted by Kubernetes itself using
mTLS and that pod-to-pod traffic for any Cilium-manged pods on the
control-plane nodes are also still encrypted via Cilium’s WireGuard
implementation.

The label selector for matching the control-plane nodes which shall not
participate in node-to-node encryption can be configured using the
`node-encryption-opt-out-labels` ConfigMap option. It defaults to
`node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane`.
You may force node-to-node encryption from and to control-plane nodes by
using an empty label selector with that option. Note that doing so is not
recommended, as it will require you to always manually update a node’s public
key in its corresponding `CiliumNode` CRD when a worker node’s public key
changes, given that the worker node will be unable to do so itself.

N/S load balancer traffic isn’t encrypted when an intermediate node redirects
a request to a different node with the following load balancer configuration:

* LoadBalancer & NodePort XDP Acceleration
* Direct Server Return (DSR) in non-Geneve dispatch mode

Egress Gateway replies are not encrypted when XDP Acceleration is enabled.

## Which traffic is encrypted[](#which-traffic-is-encrypted "Permalink to this heading")

The following table denotes which packets are encrypted with WireGuard depending
on the mode. Configurations or communication pairs not present in the following
table are not subject to encryption with WireGuard and therefore assumed to be unencrypted.

| Origin | Destination | Configuration | Encryption mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pod | remote Pod | any | default |
| Pod | remote Node | any | node-to-node |
| Node | remote Pod | any | node-to-node |
| Node | remote Node | any | node-to-node |
| **Services** | | | |
| Pod | remote Pod via ClusterIP Service | any | default |
| Pod | remote Pod via non ClusterIP Service (e.g., NodePort) | Socket LB | default |
| Pod | remote Pod via non ClusterIP Service | kube-proxy | node-to-node |
| Client outside cluster | remote Pod via Service | KPR, overlay routing, without DSR, without XDP | default |
| Client outside cluster | remote Pod via Service | native routing, without XDP | node-to-node |
| Client outside cluster | remote Pod or remote Node via Service | DSR in Geneve mode, without XDP | default |
| Pod | remote Pod via L7 Proxy or L7 Ingress Service | L7 Proxy / Ingress | default |
| **Egress Gateway** | | | |
| Pod | Egress Gateway node | Egress Gateway | default |
| Egress Gateway node | Pod | Egress Gateway without XDP | default |

* **Pod**: Cilium-managed K8s Pod running in non-host network namespace.
* **Node**: K8s host running Cilium, or Pod running in host network namespace
  managed by Cilium.
* **Service**: K8s Service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalIP).
* **Client outside cluster**: Any client which runs outside K8s cluster.
  Request between client and Node is not encrypted. Depending on Cilium
  configuration (see the table at the beginning of this section), it might be
  encrypted only between intermediate Node (which received client request first)
  and destination Node.

## Known Issues[](#known-issues "Permalink to this heading")

* Packets may be dropped when configuring the WireGuard device leading to
  connectivity issues. This happens when endpoints are added or removed or
  when node updates occur. In some cases this may lead to failed calls to
  `sendmsg` and `sendto`. See [GitHub issue 33159](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/33159) for more details.

# Unencrypted ingress/health traffic when using Wireguard transparent encryption

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-7496-fgv9-xw82
Feb 20, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

>= 1.14.0, < 1.14.7

## Patched versions

1.14.7

## Description

### Impact

For Cilium users who are using CRDs to store Cilium state (the default configuration) and [Wireguard transparent encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#encryption-wg), responses from pods to the Ingress and health endpoints are not encrypted. Traffic from the Ingress and health endpoints to pods is not affected by this issue. The health endpoint is only used for Cilium's internal health checks.

### Patches

This issue affects Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.7.

This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.7.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this issue - affected users are encouraged to upgrade.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@gandro](https://github.com/gandro) for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

If you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
