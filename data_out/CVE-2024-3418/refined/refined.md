Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `admin/deactivateteach.php` file of the Online Courseware application.
- The `selector[]` parameter, which is part of a POST request, is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`$edittable[$i]`) into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data such as customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Exploitation could grant attackers unauthorized access to the database and potentially other system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/deactivateteach.php` with a malicious value in the `selector[]` parameter.
- **SQL Injection Payload:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `selector[]` parameter to manipulate the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication (likely):**  The provided proof of concept mentions "after logging in", which implies that an attacker likely needs to be authenticated to the administrative panel before exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$edittable=$_POST['selector'];
$N = count($edittable);
for($i=0; $i < $N; $i++)
{
	$result = mysqli_query($conn,"UPDATE teacher SET mem_status='inactive' where id='$edittable[$i]'");
}
```
- The provided SQLmap output confirms time-based blind SQL injection:
```
Parameter: selector[] (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: bnm=deactivate&selector[]=1' AND (SELECT 1991 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))fAZx)-- HKIG
```
