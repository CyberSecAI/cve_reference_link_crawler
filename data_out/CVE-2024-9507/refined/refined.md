  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2024-9507",
    "description": "The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.2 due to improper input validation within the iconUpload function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to leverage a PHP filter chain attack and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in the `iconUpload` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Read",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exploited through the `iconUpload` function via a crafted request. A PHP filter chain attack is used to achieve arbitrary file read.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated with at least administrator-level access.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerable code resides in `bit-form/trunk/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php` in the `iconUpload` function around line 1210. The patch involves adding input validation using `checkExtensionWithURL()` before processing the `iconUpload` request which sanitizes the URL provided."
