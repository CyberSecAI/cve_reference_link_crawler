### [Initially looked good and easy to create a form](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-plugin-worth-its-salt/)

[juliepcb](https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliepcb/ "Posts by juliepcb")
December 29, 2024

Was looking for a new form builder that integrates with Brevo and tried loads until I found Bitform. Even in the free version which I started with it was clear that this should tick all the boxes I needed. Having created a form I was happy with, I have then reached an impass. None of the functions of the form will work on my website. It wont send me an email when someone fills in the form. I have tried a couple of times to get support but have not had a resolution as to why my forms dont send. I just keep getting sent over to Brevo SMTP. Their test email works but sending via a form does not. I bought the plugin on the strength of the form creation and I am sorry I did because it has been a total time drain for me as a sole trader. I have had to revert back to CF7 as though it is not ideal, at least I receive my email enquiries, and that is what business is all about.

I needed to automate sending WhatsApp notifications after form submissions on my WordPress website. Previously, this required complex custom development. Bit Form Pro, with its webhook support, and the integration with n8n, made this automation much simpler. Now, I can automatically send WhatsApp messages using my own API, without needing complex code. Bit Form Pro has become essential for my automations.

I‚Äôve been looking around froms plugin that is flexible and suited for developers like WS Form. Tried Fluent, WP Form, and WS Form but ended up with the Bit Form. The fluent form UI is very modern but lacks customizability. WP Form, on the other hand, feels very heavy. And I don‚Äôt want to pay a yearly fee for WS Form.
So I would like to compare Bit Form with WS form comparing the price point and User Interface. I believe Bit Form is heavily underrated. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt target the right audience properly, but it‚Äôs a blend of great UI and robust functionality that a form plugin could have.
I highly recommend this plugin.

I think bitforms better than fluent forms.
