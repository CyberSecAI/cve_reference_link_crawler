Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `add_act.php` file. Specifically, the `aname` POST parameter is directly embedded into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly neutralize special characters used in an SQL command, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (dumping databases)
  - Data modification or deletion
  - Potential compromise of the underlying database server and system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:**  The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `/control/add_act.php` endpoint.
- **Injection Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `aname` within the multipart POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication is mentioned.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$aname = $_POST['aname'];
$sql = "INSERT INTO legel_acts(act_name,status) VALUES ('$aname','1')";
```
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to use `sqlmap` to exploit the vulnerability:
  - `sqlmap -r control.add_act.txt --batch` identifies the injection point.
  - `sqlmap -r control.add_act.txt --batch --dbs` retrieves database names.
- The injection type is boolean-based blind SQL injection.
