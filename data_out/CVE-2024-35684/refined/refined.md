  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress ElasticPress plugin versions <= 5.1.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user with sufficient privileges, would perform actions on behalf of that user. This often involves tricking the user into clicking a link or loading a page with malicious code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into executing the crafted request. This requires no authentication to the vulnerable system."
