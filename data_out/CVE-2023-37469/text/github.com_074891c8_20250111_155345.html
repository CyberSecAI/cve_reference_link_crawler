New Appstore

* The application store has been fully upgraded with the addition of 30+ new applications, including support for composite applications.
  + New applications: Adminer, Alist, ChatbotUI, Cloudflared, Databag, EmulatorJS, Handbrake, MariaDB, Memos, MineOS, Mongo, MongoDB4, Overseerr, Petio, PostgreSQL, Resilio-sync, Snapdrop, Stash.
* You can add third-party app sources from one page ( the page link will be live ,align with 0.4.4 in this week), offering thousands of applications to choose from.
* Migrated from Docker-cli to Docker-compose.
* Added support for multiple languages.
* Added author type filters to the app store.
* Supports assigning multiple applications to the same network.
* Added management of global environment variables, allowing injection of arbitrary environment variables into all CasaOS applications, such as OPENAI\_API\_KEY .

  + Removed the sorting function for applications in the application store.
  + Removed the application cloning function.

Added

* Clicking on the time allows switching between 12-hour and 24-hour formats
* Clicking on the CPU temperature allows toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius
