{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setAccessDeviceCfg` function in `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` of the TOTOLINK X5000r router firmware passes user-controlled parameters `modelType` and `name` to `Uci_Add_List` without any sanitization. This allows for OS command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation/sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with malicious values for `modelType` and `name` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable function."
