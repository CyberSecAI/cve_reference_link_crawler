- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks in some of its API endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization, broken access control. Specifically, customer accounts can access all bookings and other customer data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information including all bookings and customer data.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited via the plugin's REST API endpoints `/salon/api/v1/bookings/` and `/salon/api/v1/customers/`. An attacker needs to have a customer account in the salon-booking-system which can be done by making a booking. They then use this to login via the API, obtaining an access token which they then use to make unauthorized API calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have a valid customer account on the vulnerable WordPress site to obtain an access token and perform the unauthorized API calls.
