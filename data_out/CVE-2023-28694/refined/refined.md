- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is missing CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact depends on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin, then trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting it. This could be achieved by embedding the malicious request in a website or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a request, and the user must have the required privileges to perform the action being targeted. The attacker does not need to be logged into the application.
