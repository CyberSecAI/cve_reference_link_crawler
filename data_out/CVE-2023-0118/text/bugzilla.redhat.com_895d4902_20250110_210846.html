| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2159291#c0)  ybuenos    2023-01-09 10:46:33 UTC  ``` An admin user on Foreman can bypass safe mode in templates and execute arbitrary code via the Report Templates function. When changing the "template" JSON value in the POST request, an attacker can exploit the bind() call in safemode to inject an OS command in the underlying operating system.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2159291#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-08-03 13:30:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.13 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2023:4466 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4466](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A4466)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2159291#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-08-03 18:09:19 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
