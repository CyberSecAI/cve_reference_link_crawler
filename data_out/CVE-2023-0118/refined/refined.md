{
  "CVE-2023-0118": {
    "description": "An arbitrary code execution flaw was found in Foreman. This flaw allows an admin user to bypass safe mode in templates and execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.",
    "root_cause": "An admin user on Foreman can bypass safe mode in templates and execute arbitrary code via the Report Templates function. When changing the 'template' JSON value in the POST request, an attacker can exploit the bind() call in safemode to inject an OS command in the underlying operating system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation in template processing",
      "Bypass of safe mode restrictions",
       "OS command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the underlying operating system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the template JSON value in a POST request",
      "Exploiting the bind() call in safemode",
      "Injecting OS commands into the template processing"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires an admin user account on Foreman to exploit this vulnerability."
