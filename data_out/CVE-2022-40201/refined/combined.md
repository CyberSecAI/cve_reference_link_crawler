# BE-2023-0003

# BE-2023-0003: JT file processing vulnerabilities in MicroStation.

**Bentley ID:** BE-2023-0003

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-40201, CVE-2022-41613

**Severity:** 7.8

**CVSS v3.1:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Publication date:** 2023-12-31

**Revision date:** 2023-12-31

**Summary**MicroStation applications may be affected by out-of-bounds read and stack overflow vulnerabilities when opening maliciously crafted JT (Jupiter Tessellation) files. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

**Details**Using an affected version of MicroStation to open a JT file containing maliciously crafted data can possibly force an out-of-bounds read or force the execution of arbitrary code. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities within the parsing of JT files could enable an attacker to read information or execute code in the context of the current process.

**Affected Versions**

| **Applications** | **Affected Versions** | **Mitigated Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bentley MicroStation | <= 10.17.1.\* | => 10.17.2.\* |

**Recommended Mitigations**Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of MicroStation. As a general best practice, it is also recommended to only open files from trusted sources.

**Acknowledgement**Thanks to xina1i for discovering these vulnerabilities.
