**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that occurs when parsing a malformed design (DGN) file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) - related to CVE-2022-41613 but in the same advisory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- The out-of-bounds read may allow an attacker to crash the product, disclose sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of a malformed DGN file.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted DGN file.
- The user needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability, making user interaction required.
