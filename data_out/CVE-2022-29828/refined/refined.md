Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-29828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Hard-coded cryptographic keys are present within the affected software. This can allow attackers to potentially decrypt or manipulate sensitive information or data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** If exploited, sensitive information may be disclosed, potentially allowing unauthorized users to view programs and project files or to execute programs illegally.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to the MELSEC iQ-R/F/L series CPU modules, and MELSEC iQ-R series OPC UA server module, view and execute programs, or view project files illegally.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network based (AV:N).
*   The attack complexity is high (AC:H).
*   No privileges are required (PR:N)
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N)
*   The scope is changed (S:C)
*   Confidentiality impact is high (C:H), Integrity impact is none (I:N) and Availability impact is none (A:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   The attacker does not need any specific user privileges.
*   The attacker would need to exploit the hard-coded cryptographic key to gain unauthorized access or disclose information.
*   The attack complexity is high, indicating some level of sophistication may be needed to exploit this.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The following products are affected by CVE-2022-29828:

*   **GX Works3:**
    *   Versions 1.000A to 1.011M
    *   Versions 1.015R to 1.087R
    *   Version 1.090U
    *   Version 1.095Z
    *   Version 1.096A and later
*   **GX Works2**
*   **GT Designer3 Version1 (GOT2000)**
*   **Motion Control Setting**

**Mitigations:**

*   Update to the latest version of the affected software, especially GX Works3 version 1.096A or later.
*   Ensure malicious actors cannot access project files, configuration files, and security keys stored on the host machine via untrusted networks.
*   Install antivirus software on the host machine running the software.
*   Encrypt project files and security keys when sending or receiving them over the internet.
