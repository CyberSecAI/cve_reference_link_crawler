- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access rights assigned to the service executable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission assignment (CWE-732) for a critical resource (service executable). This allows an attacker to modify or replace the executable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated local attacker can inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges. This results in a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a local unprivileged account on the system where Xpedition Designer is installed.
