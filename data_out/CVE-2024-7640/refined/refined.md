Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7640 (Based on the provided content, this CVE is related to the vulnerability described)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `delete_register.php` file of the Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System version 1.0.
- The application constructs a SQL query using data from an untrusted source without proper sanitization or parameterization, specifically from the `case_register_id` parameter in `delete_register.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `case_register_id` parameter. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL code on the database server. This could lead to:
  - Data Breaches: Access to sensitive information stored in the database.
  - Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
  - System Compromise: Potential for further attacks by modifying database structure or executing stored procedures to gain access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the value of the `case_register_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`delete_register.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`case_register_id`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by user "samwbs" on VulDB.
- The vulnerability has been verified using `sqlmap`.
- The affected software is SourceCodester Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System v.1.0.
- The `delete_register.php` file is located within the `/kortex_lite/control/` directory.
- A vulnerable SQL query is constructed at line 8 of the `delete_register.php` file.
