- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update bookings made by other customers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control (incorrect authorization), leading to both unauthorized data modification and sensitive data disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can modify other users' bookings and access sensitive data such as the full name and phone number of the person who made the booking.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access via HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid customer account created by the plugin to be able to make requests. They also need to know, or have a way to guess, appointment IDs to modify and retrieve booking information.
