- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated users can send specially crafted requests to the tcp/1050 service, leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands. The vulnerability is due to the deserialization of untrusted data, as described in CWE-502.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks using crafted requests sent to the tcp/1050 service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected FortiNAC system. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
