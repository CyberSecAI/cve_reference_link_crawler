Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Discover handles URLs within application descriptions fetched from store.kde.org. Discover automatically converts any text resembling a URL into a clickable link, regardless of the URI scheme (e.g., `http://`, `https://`, `smb://`, `nfs://`). It lacks proper validation to ensure that only `http://` or `https://` links are made clickable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the URI scheme of URLs before making them clickable. This allows non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs (such as `smb://` or `nfs://`) to be rendered as clickable links.
- **Lack of URI Scheme Restriction:** The URL parsing logic does not enforce a restriction on acceptable URI schemes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potential Chaining to Other Attack Vectors:** While directly clicking on a non-HTTP/HTTPS link in Discover is not inherently dangerous, it opens the door to potential attacks by redirecting users to potentially malicious resources. The advisory mentions this as a potential method for chaining to other attack vectors, but doesn't specify which ones.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** The primary issue is unexpected behaviour, as only HTTP/HTTPS links are intended to be made clickable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application Description:** An attacker could craft malicious application descriptions on store.kde.org that include specially crafted URLs with non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes. When a user views the description in Discover, these URLs would be made clickable.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to click on the maliciously crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Application Descriptions:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate or contribute to application descriptions that Discover fetches from store.kde.org.
- **User Lure:** The attacker relies on the user clicking on the generated link.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves modifying the regular expression used to identify URLs, restricting it to only match `http://` and `https://` links.
- The issue was fixed in Plasma 5.21.3 and 5.18.7.
- The vulnerability was reported by Fabian Br√§unlein.
