The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48958.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability exists in the RAR delta filter within libarchive. Specifically, the `src` pointer in the rar delta filter logic could move ahead of `dst`, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash and potentially other unspecified security consequences by allowing a read beyond the intended buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted RAR archive could trigger the vulnerable code path in the rar delta filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted RAR archive to be processed by libarchive.
