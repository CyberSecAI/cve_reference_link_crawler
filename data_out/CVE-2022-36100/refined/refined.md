Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user inputs within the `Main.Tags` document in XWiki. Specifically, the tag parameter is not properly escaped before being used in the document. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Eval Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code via the `tag` parameter.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code:**  The code dynamically evaluates the tag content without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject scripting code into the document.
*   **Bypassing Rights Checks:** The ability to execute Groovy, Python, or Velocity code with programming rights allows an attacker to bypass standard rights checks within the XWiki platform.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By executing code with programming rights, attackers can elevate their privileges within the system.
*   **Data Modification and Disclosure:** Attackers can modify or disclose all content stored within the XWiki installation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also be used to impact the availability of the wiki, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific URL with a malicious `tag` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The attack relies on injecting malicious code within the `tag` query parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **View Rights:** Attackers need at least view rights on the `Main.Tags` document, which is typically default for public wikis or authenticated users in private wikis.
*   **No rights (in older versions):** On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with an authentication bypass vulnerability, meaning no authentication is required to perform the attack.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `Main.Tags` document, where the `tag` parameter from the request is used without proper sanitization.
*   The attacker can inject code using the `async`, `groovy`, `python` or `velocity` macros.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `do=viewTag` parameter is present, along with the malicious `tag`.
*   The provided examples demonstrate how to inject Groovy code through the `tag` parameter:
    *   `<server>/xwiki/bin/login/Main/Tags?xpage=view&do=viewTag&tag=%7B%7Basync+async%3D%22true%22+cached%3D%22false%22+context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22hello+from+groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D`
    *  `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=%7B%7Basync%20async%3D%22true%22%20cached%3D%22false%20context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln(%22hello%20from%20groovy!%22)%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D`
    *  `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag={{/html}}{{groovy}}println(%2Fhello from groovy!%2F){{%2Fgroovy}}`
    * `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag={{/html}}{{footnote}}{{groovy}}println(%2Fhello%20from%20groovy!%2F){{%2Fgroovy}}{{/footnote}}`

**Patch Information:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in XWiki versions 13.10.6 and 14.4.
*   The fix involves escaping the tag names using `wikiEscapedTag` to prevent the execution of injected code. This was done in the file `Main/Tags.xml`.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 10.0
*   **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H**
