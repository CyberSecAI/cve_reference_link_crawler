- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Privilege Management in the Smart eVision software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software has an issue with privilege management where a regular user can exploit an API login function that lacks proper permission checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker with a regular user account can elevate their privileges to administrator level, allowing them to manipulate the system and disrupt services.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a valid regular user account to log in to the system.
