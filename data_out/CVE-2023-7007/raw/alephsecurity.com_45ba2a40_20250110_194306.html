<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>

<p>The <a href="/2024/02/20/kontrol-lux-lock-1/">first part</a> of this research
explained the work that was done in order to understand the inner workings of
Sciener’s firmware, as well as the TTLock application. In this part, we will go
over the vulnerabilities we have discovered based on that knowledge and
understanding.</p>

<h1 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h1>

<h2 id="reusing-a-virtual-key">Reusing a virtual key</h2>

<p>The first vulnerability we thought of - and it follows from simply combining
several facts about the protocol - is the ability to reuse a virtual key.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the TTLock app has the ability to grant virtual keys to
arbitrary users. Thus, e.g., an AirBNB guest can install the TTLock app, log in
with their own user, and be granted a virtual key to the house for the duration
of their stay. However, there are several facts worth considering:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The lock uses a single AES key to communicate with phones. It means, that any
  person who receives a virtual key must also receive the AES key used to
  communicate with the lock.</li>
  <li>When the virtual key is used by the TTLock app, it uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code>
  function for authorization - which requires just the time frame during which
  the virtual key is valid (i.e., the secret <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adminPs</code> is not required to call
  this function).</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> function still requires a challenge response.
  Therefore, in order to generate one, any person who receives a virtual key
  must also receive the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Armed with the understanding of the above points, the vulnerability becomes
clear: any person who receives a virtual key, has all the information required
to communicate with the lock (1, AES key), to perform authorization using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> (2, using arbitrary time frames such that the virtual key is
valid), and to supply a valid challenge response (3, using the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code>). That information can be extracted from the TTLock app upon
receiving it, and used at a later time. As a matter of fact, all of the limits
that can be applied to the virtual key (single-time use, validity time frame,
etc.) are enforced by the app itself, and not by the lock. And since none of the
values change over time, the key will remain usable by the attacker until the
lock is reset.</p>

<h2 id="challenge-bruteforcing">Challenge bruteforcing</h2>

<p>Of course, we were interested in the ability to open the lock without prior
exposure to a key (limited or not). That’s where the MITM ability would become
useful.</p>

<p>By developing a firmware that imitates the lock, we could receive connection
attempts from an unsuspecting app in place of the actual lock. The lock is only
capable of servicing a single connection at a time - i.e., once an app (or our
impersonation device) connects to the lock, it won’t be possible to connect to
it again until the connection is closed. Therefore, if we connect to the lock
continuously (and keep it open, reconnecting as necessary), our impersonation
device will be the only one actually broadcasting and accepting connections -
and that will ensure the app will connect to our device.</p>

<p>Once the connection to our impersonation device is established by the phone, we
can save the initial message coming from the app. Presumably coming from the
owner (in an attack scenario where the impersonation device is placed near the
actual lock), the message would be an encrypted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> command. While we
don’t have the encryption key, we do not need it to reuse the message - the
message will remain the same since the encryption key and the contents are
static. We save the message for future use, and forward it to the actual lock.
The lock will receive the message, and reply with a challenge request. Again, we
cannot read the contents of the challenge requests - but we send it back to the
app. The app sends the challenge response. While the response is encrypted, we
save it nonetheless - as due to the symmetric encryption and no random seeds,
this message will be reusable whenever the challenge request is the same. We
forward the response to the lock, and it unlocks, as the owner expects.</p>

<p>At this point, we have 2 important messages on hand. We have the encrypted
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> authorization message, that can be used whenever we want; and we
have the unlock message that contains a challenge response to a specific
challenge request (we do not know the value of the challenge request, since we
have no access to the encryption key). Armed with these 2 messages, we can start
a bruteforce attack on the lock:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to the lock.</li>
  <li>Send the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> authorization message.</li>
  <li>Receive an encrypted challenge request.</li>
  <li>Hope it’s the challenge value that matches our stored challenge response
  (remember, the challenge value is a random 16-bit integer, so the chance of
  that is 1/65,536).</li>
  <li>Send the stored challenge response. If the lock opens - bingo! Otherwise,
  disconnect, and go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>This kind of bruteforce attack is rather slow, since a new challenge request is
only generated upon the first time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> is issued during a connection
(that’s why we go back to step 1, and not step 2). And the process of
reconnecting to the lock can take several seconds - because of its
battery-efficient behavior. Thus, given the chance of success of 1/65,536 on
each attempt, and several seconds spent on each attempt, in practice such an
attack would take several days on average.</p>

<h2 id="plaintext-message-processing">Plaintext message processing</h2>

<p>This curious vulnerability was discovered accidentally. As we developed the code
for bruteforcing the challenge, we made a mistake: we did not encrypt one of the
messages sent to the lock (specifically, the one that contained the challenge
response). However, the code worked! In fact, we only realized our mistake days
later, when reviewing the code due to a different issue. At this point, we fixed
the code, encrypted the message, and the code continued to work as expected.
This piqued our curiosity - how was it possible, that the code worked in both
cases? And just to disillusion the readers - the challenge was definitely
processed, sending the wrong challenge response failed to open the lock.</p>

<p>We started analyzing the decryption function, and realized something intriguing.
In the beginning of the procedure, the length of the buffer is shifted 4 bits to
the right (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocks_count = len &gt;&gt; 4;</code> - AES is a block cipher, and the function
needs to know the amount of 16-byte blocks contained in the ciphertext). Then,
in the following line, the block count is checked (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (blocks_count != 0)</code>),
and if it’s 0 - that huge block of code inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>, responsible for the
actual decryption process, is skipped!</p>

<p>Control goes directly to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_0000d162</code> (repeated here for clarity), where some
logic is applied, and based on the contents of the buffer itself, the function
will return either 0 or the length of the buffer:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">blocks_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">uint</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">plaintext</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">blocks_count</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">total_decrypted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">blocks_count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">len</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">blocks_count</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">total_decrypted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">total_decrypted</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To clarify - we want to return a non-zero value, since the return value of
the function indicates the amount of decrypted bytes. A non-zero return means
the function decrypted the ciphertext successfully - but in our case, no changes
were performed to the ciphertext, and so the caller of this decryption function
will proceed to process the “ciphertext” as if it’s the decrypted plaintext. In
other words, we’ll be able to send an arbitrary message (with a few limitations,
like a length of under 16 bytes), and cause the lock to process it, without the
need to encrypt it first.</p>

<p>The logic to return a non-zero value from the function is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocks_count</code> is set to the value of the last byte of the message buffer
(that’s under our control).</li>
  <li>It should be non-zero (otherwise the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> condition is met, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total_decrypted</code> is set to 0).</li>
  <li>It should also be smaller than the length of the buffer, again - to avoid
meeting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> condition.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total_decrypted</code> is set to the difference between the length of the message
buffer, and the current value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocks_count</code>, i.e., the value of the last
byte in the message buffer.</li>
  <li>The value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total_decrypted</code> is returned.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, to maximize the size of the message we return, we should set the last
byte to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code>, and the resulting return value will be the length of the original
message buffer minus 1.</p>

<p>So, an example buffer that would meet the requirements is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">de ad be ef 01</code>, and
if such a buffer is sent - the lock will process that message, assuming it was
successfully decrypted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">de ad be ef</code>.</p>

<p>While not very useful on its own, this vulnerability can be leveraged in order
to exploit other issues found in the lock’s firmware.</p>

<h2 id="application-protocol-downgrade">Application protocol downgrade</h2>

<p>The TTLock app supports many different locks from Sciener, that communicate over
different versions of the protocol. Whereas the latest version of the protocol,
used by Kontrol Lux Lock, uses AES encryption, earlier versions are practically
unencrypted (yep, XOR with a single byte does not count as encryption in our
book). When the lock is first paired/initialized, the app figures out the
protocol version to be used with the lock, and stores it. Thus upon subsequent
connections to the lock, it knows the correct version of the protocol to use for
communicating with the lock - in our case, v3 that uses AES encryption.</p>

<p>However, there is a serious flaw in the app’s logic when processing messages
coming from the lock (apparent in the huge method called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processCommandResponse</code>, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.ttlock.bl.sdk.service.BluetoothLeService</code>
class). Instead of relying on what it knows about the lock, the app parses the
incoming message, including the information about the protocol version used, and
processes the message based on the protocol version indicated in the message
header. It means that when we impersonate the lock, upon receiving the initial,
AES-encrypted authorization message, we can reply with a response using a lower
protocol version (that isn’t encrypted), and the app will process it. Similar to
the previous vulnerability, we can supply data to the app without knowing the
encryption key.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! The issue is exacerbated further by another flaw: once
the app processes the protocol version in the response message, it also uses
that protocol version in the subsequent messages sent to the lock during that
session. It means that we essentially can coerce the app to expose the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code> during our MITM attack, and as we will see shortly - this will
considerably reduce the time required to open the lock during exploitation. The
MITM attack flow becomes as following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stage one (MITM attack)
    <ol>
      <li>Keep the lock busy, so that the app connects to our impersonation device.</li>
      <li>Store the AES-encrypted authorization message, just like before.</li>
      <li>Reply with a challenge request with a known value (such as 0), while
downgrading the protocol so encryption isn’t used.</li>
      <li>Receive an unencrypted challenge response from the app, and calculate the
value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code> (if the challenge request was 0, the challenge
response is the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code>).</li>
      <li>Store the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code>, close the connection, and drop the MITM
act (at this point, the legitimate user will wonder why the lock didn’t
respond to the unlock command, and will presumably try again).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Stage two (unlocking)
    <ol>
      <li>Connect to the lock.</li>
      <li>Supply the AES-encrypted authorization message.</li>
      <li>Receive an AES-encrypted challenge request.</li>
      <li>Using the previous vulnerability (plaintext message processing by the
lock), respond with an unencrypted challenge response. While we don’t
know the challenge value (it was encrypted), we know the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code>, and we simply guess the challenge value with a 1/65,536
chance that the response will be accepted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s the kicker: the lock does not close the connection when a wrong
challenge response was provided; it does not generate a new challenge request;
and it does not limit the amount of attempts a challenge response can be
supplied. That means that step 2.4 above is repeated, enumerating over the
65,536 possible values of the challenge, until the lock opens up. And, contrary
to the first challenge bruteforcing, in this case the connection to the lock
remains open - considerably speeding up the process. Our testing showed that we
could send about 30 challenge responses per second. At that rate, it would take
about 40 minutes to enumerate over all the possible challenge values. And since
the challenge value does not change during the attack, we are guaranteed to open
the lock in 40 minutes or less. In fact, the median time for opening the lock
will be just 20 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="gateway-key-replacement">Gateway key replacement</h2>

<p>The gateway does not contain the lock encryption key (and thus, any data that is
intended for the lock cannot be read by the gateway). Thus, taking control of
the gateway does not result in an immediate takeover of the lock itself.
Nonetheless, there was one glaring issue with the gateway’s implementation (its
server, to be precise).</p>

<p>When we analyzed the protocol used by the gateway, we developed a Python script
that would emulate the gateway. The script would connect to Sciener’s server,
and authenticate as a gateway. A short reminder - the initial connection would
use a known, hardcoded AES key, and afterwards a new, random AES key would be
generated and used for subsequent connections.</p>

<p>The gateway is identified by the server solely by its MAC address. So we could
easily create a fake gateway with a generated MAC address, and the server would
assume that a new gateway has been activated. So far, so good - but what would
be the purpose of such a gateway in an attack scenario? The gateway protocol
supports a message that indicates a lock detected nearby (essentially, it
retransmits the lock’s advertisement packet). That means, we could indicate to
the server that our fake gateway was next to a real-life lock that we intended
to attack. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough for the server to start sending
messages intended to that lock through our gateway - when a gateway is
initialized through the proper channels (using the app), it is “paired” to the
owner’s locks on the server’s side. So, messages intended for the lock are only
sent through gateways belonging to the lock’s owner.</p>

<p>So, we needed to impersonate an existing gateway, i.e. with a MAC address that
was already registered by the server. Ostensibly, this shouldn’t be possible,
since the encryption key has already been generated and in use… But we found
this assumption to be completely false!</p>

<p>To recap, the process of a gateway
initialization is as follows (we’ll call the hardcoded AES key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HAK</code>, and the
generated AES key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GAK</code>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to the server and announce yourself (MAC included) encrypted with
HAK.</li>
  <li>Receive server’s acknowledgement, encrypted with HAK.</li>
  <li>Generate a new GAK, encrypt it with HAK, and send it to the server.</li>
  <li>Receive server’s acknowledgement, encrypted with the new GAK.</li>
  <li>From this point onwards, all communications are encrypted with the new GAK.</li>
</ol>

<p>When a gateway reconnects to the server after it has already been initialized
(e.g. after a power outage), it simply skips steps 3-4 above, and communicates
using the GAK that is already stored in the gateway and on the server.</p>

<p>However, we discovered that if we emulate an existing gateway (i.e., use a MAC
address that has already been registered with another gateway), and simply send
a message with a new GAK, encrypted with HAK, the server accepts it and switches
to use it in the following communications! Furthermore, the server uses the most
recent connection with a given gateway MAC address. I.e., when the server will
need to send a message to the lock through a gateway with the registered MAC, it
will use our connection! At this point, we can carry out the same attacks that
required a BLE MITM.</p>

<p>There is one limitation to this vulnerability: it’s difficult to find out the
gateway’s MAC. Whereas the lock advertises itself openly, the gateway only
advertises itself for the first 60 seconds from powering up (so that a phone
can connect to it and initialize it), and once that time passes (and it’s
connected to the server), it uses BLE solely in client mode, to connect to the
lock. So, the only plausible way for an attacker to find out the gateway’s MAC
would be to cause a power outage to the target apartment - a task that is not
necessarily easy, depending on the infrastructure (newer apartments usually have
the breakers inside the apartment), and certainly not very stealthy.</p>

<h2 id="undocumented-check_user_time-alternative">Undocumented <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> alternative</h2>

<p>When analyzing the code in the lock’s firmware that’s responsible for processing
the different commands, we found a piece of code that was very similar to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> command, but instead of verifying the time frame provided was
correct, it simply verified that the message contained the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCIENER</code>. If
the check was successful, the function would proceed as if user authorization
was achieved, and returned a challenge request. We assume that this command is
used by BLE remote controls (not provided with our lock).</p>

<p>Presumably, there’s nothing interesting in this discovery, since the contents
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> message are not secret (as opposed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code>).
But there’s one important difference here: the message size of a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_user_time</code> command is 0x11 bytes, meaning it is not susceptible to the
plaintext processing vulnerability. Whereas this new command only contains the
word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCIENER</code>, and thus a message containing the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"SCIENER\x01"</code> will be
accepted, processed, and successfully pass the user authorization step (since
the value comparison does not use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strcmp</code>, but an equivalent of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strstr</code>).</p>

<p>Thus, we can gain user authorization without prior knowledge - and without the
MITM attack. And once authorized, we can proceed to bruteforce the challenge,
again, by providing the challenge responses exploiting the plaintext processing
vulnerability. Essentially, we have a challenge bruteforcing attack without any
prerequisites.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the maximum data throughput of a BLE connection is 1Mbps
(or 2Mbps in certain configurations), the lock operates at a far slower rate
(presumably, for power efficiency). Thus, we weren’t able to send more than ~30
challenge responses per second. And since in this attack, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unlockKey</code> value
is unknown, we enumerate over its range (a 0 - 1000000000, and not a complete
32 bits, due to the way it’s generated), and not the 16 bits of the challenge
value. Thus, a successful unlocking will take at most about a year, and the
median time to unlock will be about half a year, making this attack not
practical.</p>

<h2 id="wireless-keypad-bruteforcing">Wireless keypad bruteforcing</h2>

<p>In the <a href="/2024/02/20/kontrol-lux-lock-1/#wireless-keypad-functionality">previous</a>
post, we described how a wireless keypad connects to the lock, generates an AES
key for further communication, and then transmits key presses performed by its
user. Keen-eyed readers will have noticed that the initial key used for starting
the communication is hardcoded. In other words, anyone can start communicating
with the lock using that key, and the lock will assume it’s a new wireless
keypad. The lock does not have a management of previously connected wireless
keypads, so this action will always succeed, regardless of whether the lock has
been used with a wireless keypad beforehand.</p>

<p>Once the attacker has impersonated a wireless keypad connection, they can send
key presses just like a wireless keypad would. However, the protocol supports
sending multiple key presses at once (for efficiency, to avoid the overhead of
a complete BLE packet for each key press). Therefore, instead of sending each
key press separately, the attacker can string multiple PINs one after the other
(separated by the # key press), that will be processed by the lock in sequence,
instead of testing those PINs by inputting them into the lock keypad manually.
This speeds up brute forcing of the PIN considerably.</p>

<p>Another issue that makes the attack even more efficient is the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strstr</code>
function in the lock’s code, when testing the user input against the stored PIN.
Given that the admin’s PIN code generated at lock initialization consists of 7
digits, and PIN codes can be 10 digits in length, each 10-digit PIN code sent by
the attacker actually tests for multiple options. For example, when the attacker
tests the PIN <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0123456789</code>, the lock will open if the actual PIN is either of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0123456</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1234567</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2345678</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3456789</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That’s 4 tests in a single attempt (and remember, multiple attempts in a single
BLE message are possible)! Enumerating over all the PIN options in the most
efficient way is basically the following combinatorial problem: find a set of
minimum size, that consists of 10-digit strings, and every possible 7-digit
string appears as a consecutive substring of a string in the set. There are
10^7 strings of 7 digits. Therefore, a naive solution would be to simply pad
each 7-digit string with zeroes and call it a day. But can we do better?</p>

<p>Every 10-digit string consists of at most 4 unique 7-digit strings, so the best
we can hope of is to use 10^7/4 strings in total. Is such a solution possible?
Turns out that the answer is yes! The algorithm heavily relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence">de Bruijn Sequence</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a de Bruijn sequence of order 7 on a size-10 alphabet - it is a
cyclic sequence in which every 7-digit string occurs exactly once as a
substring. The general de Bruijn sequence is denoted as B(k, n) and it has the
length k^n (we have k=10, n=7). The construction of B(k, n) is well known. This
Python code, taken from Wikipedia, constructs it:</p>

<p>How does this solve our problem? Well, we can “slice” the sequence into strings
of length 10. The first string will consist of the digits in indexes 0 to 9, the
second - 4 to 13, the third - 8 to 17, and so on. The first 18 digits of our de
Bruijn sequence will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">000000010000002000</code>. Therefore, the first 3 strings
will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0000000100</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0001000000</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0000002000</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, we will end up with 10^7/4 strings, and every 7-digit string will
appear as a substring exactly once. That results in a complete enumeration
within 10^7/4 (2,500,000) attempts, and on average, half of these attempts
(1,250,000) will be required.</p>

<p>It sounds like a very serious flaw that would allow opening the lock very
quickly, and it would be - but it’s hindered by one protection mechanism that
makes this attack impractical. In the case of PIN codes, as opposed to challenge
responses, the lock actually limits the amount of mistakes a user can make (it’s
about 5). Once the limit is reached, the lock emits an alarm sound, and refuses
any input for about 15 seconds. This is a limitation that, despite our best
efforts, we were not able to circumvent. And so, even if the alarm sound is
deemed insignificant, enumerating all the possibilities will take a
prohibitively long time. Nonetheless, if somebody does discover a way to
overcome the rate limit, this vulnerability becomes critical and allows opening
the lock in a matter of minutes at most.</p>

<h2 id="unauthenticated-update-and-complete-takeover">Unauthenticated update and complete takeover</h2>

<p>From the beginning of our research, we focused on the BLE service used by the
app to send various commands to the lock, identified by the UUID
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00001910-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb</code>. In fact, we even began analyzing the
relevant command for engaging the OTA update (command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x02</code>), but it required
successfully passing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> check and challenge, so we did not
investigate it further at the time.</p>

<p>At some point, however, as we were poking around the firmware, we realized
something quite surprising: there was another BLE service, with a separate write
characteristic and all, responsible for the firmware update! We’ve actually
seen this service before (it’s exposed during the regular BLE scan), but we
ignored it, not knowing its purpose. Now, however, we reached the point in the
firmware that was responsible for handling messages in this service, and -
eventually - updating the firmware on the lock (shortened for brevity):</p>

<p>That function is rather long, with various logic checks applied throughout it,
but here is an attempt to describe the process in a simple manner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 4 types of messages that this service can process - 3 control
messages and 1 data message:
    <ol>
      <li>Control message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff00</code> - unimplemented in the analyzed firmware (the app
side refers to this as “prepare firmware update”)</li>
      <li>Control message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff01</code> - begin firmware update</li>
      <li>Control message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff02</code> - complete firmware update</li>
      <li>Data message, containing a 16-bit offset (flash address to write to), the
bytes to be written (up to 16), and the CRC of the message. The offset
should be aligned to 0x10.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>First, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff01</code> control message is sent, indicating that a firmware
update is about to begin. When handling this message, the lock verifies that
a firmware update has actually been requested, by checking a flag that is set
when the OTA command (command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x02</code>, mentioned above) is sent. This function
prepares the firmware update process by setting the expected chunks count to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x4000</code> (and with each chunk being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x10</code> bytes long, a firmware with the
size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x40000</code> bytes - exactly the size of a flash partition). It also
initializes another variable in the context structure that is supposed to
hold the last offset that has been written.</li>
  <li>Next, firmware chunks are sent one by one, with increasing offsets. As each
chunk is received, the lock verifies a few things (that it’s the expected
chunk - i.e., the offset follows the previously received one; that the
expected amount of chunks hasn’t been reached), and then writes the data to
flash. It’s worth noting here that the lock uses two flash partitions, at
offsets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x40000</code>, to hold the firmware. One partition is marked
active (and is booted and running), and the other is marked inactive (and the
OTA update is written to it). The app sending the update does not need to be
aware of the actual partition in use, and should always use offsets starting
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x0</code> - the lock maps it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x40000</code> automatically, if required.</li>
  <li>Finally, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff02</code> control message is sent. The lock marks the written
firmware as ready to boot (and the currently running firmware as invalid),
and reboots. Upon boot, the bootloader will select the new active partition,
and the new firmware will be up and running at that point.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ostensibly, the process is well protected, as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff01</code> message verifies a
flag that can only be set by passing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check_admin</code> check properly. However,
what happens if we skip this initial message altogether?</p>

<p>Well, there are two main obstacles to pass. One is the complex logic of handling
data. After many unsuccessful attempts to write chunks of data that would fit
the logical conditions sprayed throughout the function body, we realized
(rather by accident) that most of these conditions exist to verify that the
first 2 chunks (the first 32 bytes) written actually match what’s expected of a
firmware start. That’s why our names for some of the variables in the code above
may be misleading - they are simply remnants of an attempt to understand the
function prior to this discovery. And the second obstacle would be an issue with
the chunks expectation and the processed chunks - both being set by the initial
message handler. However, it seems that those values are either preset by the
firmware regardless, or are overwritten after the initial chunks (that contain
the expected firmware size) are received.</p>

<p>And so, the exploit of this vulnerability becomes as simple as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build a firmware for the lock (an SDK is available from Telink).</li>
  <li>Connect to the lock over BLE.</li>
  <li>Write the firmware to the OTA service/characteristic, in chunks of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x10</code>
bytes each (preceded with an increasing offset and followed by a CRC).</li>
  <li>Write the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff02</code> to that characteristic.</li>
  <li>The lock will restart and boot into the custom firmware - game over!</li>
</ol>

<p>For proof-of-concept purposes, we developed a firmware that reads the admin’s
PIN (not to be confused with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adminPs</code>, the PIN is simply a 7-digit code that
can be used over the keypad to open the lock). It then exposes the PIN via beeps
(transmitting over BLE is a more robust approach, but requires more coding and
doesn’t look as impressive on video), marks itself as invalid and the original
firmware as active, and reboots. Thus, it provides the attacker the means to
open the lock at any time, while leaving the lock completely unchanged. We
promised lockpicking - but, in our opinion, this is even better! It’s more akin
to creating a master key by merely looking at a lock.</p>

<p>We did run into one issue: it’s not possible to push big firmware updates using
this method - the limit seems to be around the 15-16KB. That’s not a limitation
of the size, however - there seems to be a watchdog that stops the firmware
update process, and 15-16KB is simply the size that’s small enough to finish
transferring before the watchdog kicks in. The real firmware is quite a bit
bigger, but the official update mechanism simply disables the watchdog prior to
performing the update. Of course, if there is a real need to upload a bigger
firmware, it’s possible to do by developing a smaller, bootstrap firmware, that
is only responsible for receiving and writing the real one.</p>

<h2 id="unprotected-debug-port">Unprotected debug port</h2>

<p>We’d like to finish this post with one last, physical issue. As we mentioned
<a href="/2024/02/20/kontrol-lux-lock-1/#Analyzing-in-Ghidra">before</a>, the
lock contains two TLSR8251 chips, one on each side. Our initial assumption was
that the chip located on the apartment side (i.e., accessible from within the
apartment) is the one responsible for all the communication and logic, whereas
the second chip (located outside) is only responsible for passing along the
input from the peripherals located outside (keypad, fingerprint reader, RFID
reader). We were shocked to discover that the firmware we analyzed was, in fact,
the firmware of the chip located outside! That meant that all of the business,
security, and communications logic was running on the chip that was exposed to
the outside world, whereas the chip that was more protected was merely
responsible for operating the lock motor based on commands from the main chip.
But, how detrimental is it to the lock’s security? As it turns out, very.</p>

<p>Remember, an attacker that has access to the debug pin has complete control over
the functionality of the lock. And the Telink chips require only a single wire
for debugging purposes (that’s in addition to ground and voltage, but that can
be easily matched with the debugger through the micro-USB port located on the
outside part of the lock and intended for emergency power). And the debug port
has a breakout pad (marked on the following image).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/kontrol-lux-lock/SN-9246-4-1-with-debug-mark.png" alt="Mainboard of the outside side unit" title="Mainboard of the outside unit" />()</p>

<p>But what makes this issue really severe is the fact that on the other side of
the board is just a piece of plastic with the keypad numbers on it. There is
literally no other protection between that debug port and the outside world.
Therefore, an attacker who knows the exact location of the breakout pad in
relation to the keypad (and that can be easily measured if you have such a lock
on your hands) can drill a tiny hole, insert a wire connected to a debugger, and
gain complete control over the main MCU of the lock.</p>
