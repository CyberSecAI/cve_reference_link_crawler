  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-7007",
      "root_cause": "The lock firmware has a vulnerability where it does not properly check if the message is encrypted before processing it. Specifically the decryption function can be bypassed to process plaintext messages if the message length is less than 16 bytes and the last byte of the message has a specific value. This allows arbitrary messages to be processed without needing to be encrypted.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Plaintext message processing vulnerability: The decryption function can be bypassed allowing plaintext messages to be processed"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can send arbitrary messages to the lock without encryption, which can be leveraged in order to exploit other issues found in the lock's firmware, including the ability to brute force the challenge response to unlock the door.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted message to the lock that bypasses the decryption function."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to connect to the lock via Bluetooth."
