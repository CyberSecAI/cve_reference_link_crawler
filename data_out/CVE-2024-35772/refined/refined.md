- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hueman theme for WordPress versions 3.7.24 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case, but it could lead to unauthorized modifications or actions on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page, which would trigger an action on the vulnerable site without the user's consent or knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into initiating it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable site, but they must be able to target an authenticated user.
