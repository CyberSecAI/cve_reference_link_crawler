  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to unencrypted traffic being sent between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes, as well as between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes, when WireGuard is enabled and Layer 7 policies are in place.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Traffic that should be WireGuard-encrypted is sent unencrypted.",
        "The issue occurs with Layer 7 policies."

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic between nodes within a Cilium cluster.",

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be positioned on the network such that they can intercept traffic between nodes in a Cilium cluster with WireGuard enabled and L7 policies in place, i.e. adjacent access."
