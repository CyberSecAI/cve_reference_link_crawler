Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3733

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_load_more()`, `eael_woo_pagination_product_ajax()`, and `ajax_eael_product_gallery()` functions within the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. These functions did not properly check or sanitize the `post_status` parameter, leading to information exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically posts with a `private` or `draft` status.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The plugin inadequately handles the `post_status` parameter in AJAX requests. It does not enforce that only 'publish' status posts should be retrieved, allowing attackers to potentially extract posts that were not meant to be public.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can access and view the content of private or draft posts, which may contain sensitive or confidential information not intended for public viewing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated AJAX Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions (`ajax_load_more()`, `eael_woo_pagination_product_ajax()`, and `ajax_eael_product_gallery()`) without needing any prior authentication or user privileges.
- **Manipulated `args` Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `args` parameter in the AJAX request, specifically the `post_status` parameter, which can then be used to extract posts with statuses other than 'publish'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need any credentials or user accounts on the affected WordPress site.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin/function:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable plugin and function names.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Plugin:** Essential Addons for Elementor â€“ Best Elementor Templates, Widgets, Kits & WooCommerce Builders
- **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 5.9.15
- **Patched Version:** 5.9.16
- **Patch Details:** The patch in version 5.9.16 enforces `post_status` to be `publish` within the functions or uses an intersection with allowed values, preventing access to private and draft posts.
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
