The provided content relates to CVE-2023-22887.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `DagRun.run_id` parameter in Apache Airflow. Specifically, the `run_id` was not being properly validated which could lead to issues when this parameter is used within the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of user-provided input (`DagRun.run_id`).
- Potential for injection or other unexpected behavior due to the lack of input validation.
- Usage of regular expression for sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is not explicitly stated as an injection vulnerability. However, the discussion suggests that the concern was related to preventing "illegal file access" (likely meaning the ability to cause file path manipulation).

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted `run_id` string when triggering a DAG run, which could then cause unexpected behavior within the application. This could be done through the web UI or API of Apache Airflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a user with the ability to trigger DAG runs and modify the `run_id` parameter.
