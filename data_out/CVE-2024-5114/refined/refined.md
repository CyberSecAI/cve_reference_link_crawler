Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index` parameter of the `/view/teacher_attendance_history1.php` file within the Complete Web-Based School Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within the `index` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user and system data can be leaked as a result of successful SQL injection.
- **Compromised System Security:** Exploitation can lead to a compromise of the entire system.
- **Unauthorised access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP request by manipulating the `index` parameter.
- **Payload:** The provided payload is `index='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(12)))v)%2B'`, which uses the `sleep()` function to confirm the SQL injection by introducing a time delay in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/view/teacher_attendance_history1.php` endpoint of the application.
- No authentication or special privileges are mentioned. It is implied that the vulnerability is exploitable by anyone able to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
