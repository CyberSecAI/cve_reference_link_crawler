Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Incorrect authorization in the protocol communication between the WatchGuard Authentication Gateway (Single Sign-On Agent) and the WatchGuard Single Sign-On Client (both Windows and macOS versions).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability lies in the improper authorization of communication between the SSO Agent and SSO Client. This allows an attacker to forge communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could retrieve authenticated usernames and group memberships from the Single Sign-On Agent.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could send arbitrary account and group information to the Single Sign-On Agent for their host.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Though not explicitly stated, the ability to forge communications could potentially aid in lateral movement within a compromised network by manipulating user or group information.
*   **Note:** The vulnerability cannot be used to obtain user credentials directly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected components (the SSO Agent and SSO client).
*   **Forged Communications:** The attacker leverages the authorization flaw to forge communication packets between the SSO Agent and client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have already gained access to the network where the vulnerable systems are located. The document does not specify the method of initial compromise.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Authentication Gateway (aka Single Sign-On Agent) versions through 12.10.2
    *   Windows Single Sign-On Client versions through 12.7
    *   MacOS Single Sign-On Client versions through 12.5.4.
*   **Workaround:** WatchGuard recommends using Windows Firewall rules to restrict network access to TCP ports 4116 and 4114. Specifically:
    *   Restrict port 4116 (SSO Client) to only allow connections from the SSO Agent.
    *   Restrict port 4114 (SSO Agent) to only allow connections from the Firebox.
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was found by RedTeam Pentesting GmbH
