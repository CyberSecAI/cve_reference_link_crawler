- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Form to Chat App WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website, which will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: A contributor-level attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin. The injected script will be executed when other users access the affected parts of the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a Contributor on the WordPress site.
