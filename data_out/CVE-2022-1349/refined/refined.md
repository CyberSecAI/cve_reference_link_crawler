- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPQA plugin does not validate if the `image_id` parameter provided in the `wpqa_remove_image` AJAX action belongs to the requesting user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any user with minimal privileges (Subscriber) can delete the profile pictures of any other user.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious AJAX request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=wpqa_remove_image` and providing the target user's `image_id`, any low privileged user can delete another user's profile picture.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least a Subscriber role. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
