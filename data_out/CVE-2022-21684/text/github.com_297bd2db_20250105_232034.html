# Bypass user approval when invited

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-p63q-jp48-h8xh
Jan 13, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= v2.7.12; beta <= v2.8.0.beta10; tests-passed <= v2.8.0.beta10

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.7.13; beta >= 2.8.0.beta11; tests-passed >= 2.8.0.beta11

## Description

### Impact

A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log in back.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Workarounds

Disable invites. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users (e.g. trust level 4).
