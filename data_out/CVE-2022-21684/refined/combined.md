# Bypass user approval when invited

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-p63q-jp48-h8xh
Jan 13, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= v2.7.12; beta <= v2.8.0.beta10; tests-passed <= v2.8.0.beta10

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.7.13; beta >= 2.8.0.beta11; tests-passed >= 2.8.0.beta11

## Description

### Impact

A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log in back.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Workarounds

Disable invites. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users (e.g. trust level 4).

Our Forum has these settings:

1. login\_required ON
2. must\_approve\_users ON
3. min\_trust\_level\_to\_allow\_invite 2 : member

When testing our forum invites, I noticed that:

1. When a TL2 user invites another user via email *and*
2. They click the invite link in their email *and*
3. They fill in the fields and submit it

This happens → they are taken straight into the Forum (as though pre-approved), and can read it at will. They should not be able to do this until approved.

They indeed remain unapproved. If they try to access the site again, they are prevented with the standard “you aren’t approved” message.

Indeed, I can repro this on 2.8.0.beta10 (  [bbca25e875](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commits/bbca25e875c36d3541b22c520b6d56ae6322dfbe)  )

I can confirm on my test site ([17ec3bc5b9](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commits/17ec3bc5b9ebf2ed241035dc37cec25475c5e4ad))

* Log on required
* Must approve users
* TL2 can send invites

And my invitee could view and post on that ‘sign-up visit’ without being approved.

This is a complicated situation.

We have no implementation at the moment for “Hold tight, until someone approves your account”

In fact I am not sure it even makes sense, why would you invite someone to the forum just for them to be blocked.

I would say your immediate workaround is disallowing invites on tl2/3 … that will at least seal off this quirk.

I guess we should, at least in the interim, completely disable invite for **non staff** when `must_approve_users` is ON.

Done. Of course, TL4s will still have the problem of course, but I don’t actually have any of those so all good!

That makes sense to me as a permanent solution.

I was a little surprised that my punters could invite others!

I am torn on this one because I understand both sides. However, I am thinking the status quo is a bit misleading because not all users who sign up must be approved.

To a certain extent, I guess it depends on the community and how much trust you put in your users. Maybe in the future must\_approve\_users can be a dropdown: no, yes or if not invited.

I am going to put this on my TODO list.
