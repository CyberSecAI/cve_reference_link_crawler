Due to the missing authorization checks in the
local systems, the admin users of SAP Web Dispatcher, SAP NetWeaver Application
Server (ABAP and Java), and SAP Content Server can impersonate other users and
may perform some unintended actions. This could lead to a low impact on
confidentiality and a high impact on the integrity and availability of the
applications.
