[`0213b81`](/zulip/zulip/commit/0213b811ec6cd0edce84d1f39c0e2d6c2ffa6768)

* CVE-2021-43799: Remote execution of code involving RabbitMQ.
* Closed access to RabbitMQ port 25672; initial installs tried to

  close this port, but failed to restart RabbitMQ for the

  configuration.
* Removed the `rabbitmq.nodename` configuration in `zulip.conf`; all

  RabbitMQ instances will be reconfigured to have a nodename of

  `zulip@localhost`. You can remove this setting from your

  `zulip.conf` configuration file, if it exists.
* Added missing support for the Camo image proxy in the Docker

  image. This resolves a longstanding issue with image previews, if

  enabled, appearing as broken images for Docker-based installs.
* Fixed a bug which allowed a user to edit a message to add a wildcard

  mention when they did not have permissions to send such messages

  originally.
* Fixed a bug in the tool that corrects database corruption caused by

  updating the operating system hosting PostgreSQL, which previously

  omitted some indexes from its verification. If you updated the

  operating system of your Zulip instance from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04,

  or from Debian Stretch to Debian Buster, you should run the tool,

  even if you did so previously; full details and instructions are

  available in the previous blog post.
* Began routing requests from the Camo image proxy through a

  non-Smokescreen proxy, if one is configured; because Camo includes

  logic to deny access to private subnets, routing its requests

  through Smokescreen is generally not necessary.
* Fixed a bug where changing the Camo secret required running

  `zulip-puppet-apply`.
* Fixed `scripts/setup/compare-settings-to-template` to be able to run

  from any directory.
* Switched Let's Encrypt renewal to use its own timer, rather than our

  custom cron job. This fixes a bug where occasionally `nginx` would

  not reload after getting an updated certificate.
* Updated documentation and tooling to note that installs using

  `upgrade-zulip-from-git` require 3 GB of RAM, or 2 GB and at least 1

  GB of swap.
