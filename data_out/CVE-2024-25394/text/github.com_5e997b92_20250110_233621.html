| Hi,  I would like to report other potential vulnerabilities in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerabilities are confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Multiple potential vulnerabilities in RT-Thread ymodem utilitySummary I spotted some potential vulnerabilities at the following locations in the RT-Thread ymodem utility source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/utilities/ymodem/ry_sy.c#L149> <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/utilities/ymodem/ry_sy.c#L205> <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/utilities/ymodem/ry_sy.c#L225> Details Unbounded `rt_sprintf()` in the `_rym_send_begin()` function could lead to a buffer overflow at the marked line:  ``` static enum rym_code _rym_send_begin(     struct rym_ctx *ctx,     rt_uint8_t *buf,     rt_size_t len) {     struct custom_ctx *cctx = (struct custom_ctx *)ctx;     struct stat file_buf;     char insert_0 = '\0';     rt_err_t err;      cctx->fd = open(cctx->fpath, O_RDONLY);     if (cctx->fd < 0)     {         err = rt_get_errno();         rt_kprintf("error open file: %d\n", err);         return RYM_ERR_FILE;     }     rt_memset(buf, 0, len);     err = stat(cctx->fpath, &file_buf);     if (err != RT_EOK)     {         rt_kprintf("error open file.\n");         return RYM_ERR_FILE;     }      const char *fdst = _get_path_lastname(cctx->fpath);     if(fdst != cctx->fpath)     {         fdst = dfs_normalize_path(RT_NULL, fdst);         if (fdst == RT_NULL)         {             return RYM_ERR_FILE;         }     }      rt_sprintf((char *)buf, "%s%c%d", fdst, insert_0, file_buf.st_size); /* VULN: if we can make fdst large enough, there's no bound checking */      return RYM_CODE_SOH; } ```  Lack of NUL-termination in the `rym_download_file()` function at the marked line:  ``` static rt_err_t rym_download_file(rt_device_t idev,const char *file_path) {     rt_err_t res;     struct custom_ctx *ctx = rt_calloc(1, sizeof(*ctx));      if (!ctx)     {         rt_kprintf("rt_malloc failed\n");         return -RT_ENOMEM;     }     ctx->fd = -1;     rt_strncpy(ctx->fpath, file_path, DFS_PATH_MAX); /* VULN: unterm if file_path is at least DFS_PATH_MAX bytes (comes from argv); it might cause infoleak or memory corruption */     RT_ASSERT(idev);     res = rym_recv_on_device(&ctx->parent, idev, RT_DEVICE_OFLAG_RDWR | RT_DEVICE_FLAG_INT_RX,                              _rym_recv_begin, _rym_recv_data, _rym_recv_end, 1000);     rt_free(ctx);      return res; } ```  Lack of NUL-termination in the `rym_upload_file()` function at the marked line:  ``` static rt_err_t rym_upload_file(rt_device_t idev, const char *file_path) {     rt_err_t res = 0;      struct custom_ctx *ctx = rt_calloc(1, sizeof(*ctx));     if (!ctx)     {         rt_kprintf("rt_malloc failed\n");         return -RT_ENOMEM;     }     ctx->fd = -1;     rt_strncpy(ctx->fpath, file_path, DFS_PATH_MAX); /* VULN: unterm if file_path is at least DFS_PATH_MAX bytes (comes from argv); it might cause infoleak or memory corruption */     RT_ASSERT(idev);     res = rym_send_on_device(&ctx->parent, idev,                              RT_DEVICE_OFLAG_RDWR | RT_DEVICE_FLAG_INT_RX,                              _rym_send_begin, _rym_send_data, _rym_send_end, 1000);     rt_free(ctx);      return res; } ``` Impact If the unchecked input above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported vulnerabilities could range from information leakage to denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |
