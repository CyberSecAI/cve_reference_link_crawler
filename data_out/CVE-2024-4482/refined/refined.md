### Summary of CVE-2024-4482
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `text_days` attribute within the 'Countdown' widget. This allows users to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'text\_days' attribute of the Countdown widget, leading to XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker (Contributor level and above) can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. When other users access these injected pages, the attacker's script will execute in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 'Countdown' widget within the WordPress admin panel.
- An attacker would need to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access. This implies having the capability to edit page content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with a role of Contributor or higher. This allows them to create/edit posts/pages.
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin panel to use the Elementor editor.
- The attacker would craft a malicious input for the `text_days` attribute of the countdown widget

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 5.6.1 of the "The Plus Addons for Elementor" plugin.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.6.2 of the plugin
