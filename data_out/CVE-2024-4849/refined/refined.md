Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'autoplay' parameter within the WordPress Automatic Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `autoplay` parameter, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. When this stored data is displayed to users, the unsanitized scripts are executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script will execute. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to phishing pages or sites hosting malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the website.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information accessible by the user, such as admin credentials

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated User Input:** The attacker exploits the `autoplay` parameter. The specific mechanism for how this is done is not detailed in this write up but the plugin handles this parameter and saves it in the database without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level access.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the WordPress Automatic Plugin up to and including 3.94.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 3.95.0 and later.
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.4 (Medium)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
