**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker only needs to access the "Forgot Password" functionality of the Document Creator script.

**Additional details:**

*   This vulnerability is one of multiple user enumeration vulnerabilities present in various PHPJabbers products, all stemming from the same flawed password reset mechanism.
