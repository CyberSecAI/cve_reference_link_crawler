**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `TunnelId` parameter in the `/admin/add_ikev2.php` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause harm to the server. The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could extract the admin username and password by injecting SQL code through the vulnerable parameter.
*   This can lead to unauthorized access and potentially full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface at the path `/admin/add_ikev2.php`.
*   The attack vector is the `TunnelId` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which likely requires network access to the application.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable URL is: `/admin/add_ikev2.php`
* The vulnerable parameter is `TunnelId`.
* An example payload to extract admin username and password is provided as part of the URL:
`https://1.85.53.53/admin/add_ikev2.php?TunnelId=1%20and%20extractvalue(0x1,%20concat(0x1,%20(select%20concat(adminname,%200x7e,%20passwd)%20from%20Admin%20limit%201)))%20%23`
