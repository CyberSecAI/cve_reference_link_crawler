    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-3223",
    "products": [
      "Oracle Outside In Technology"
    ],
    "affected_versions": [
      "8.5.3",

    "component": "Outside In Filters",

     "user_interaction": "Required",
    "scope": "Unchanged",
    "confidentiality_impact": "Low",
    "integrity_impact": "None",
    "availability_impact": "High",
    "base_score": 7.1,
    "impact": "Allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The specific vulnerability is within the Outside In Filters component. When processing data over a network, a specially crafted input can trigger a vulnerability within the parsing logic, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The software's lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to potentially crash the service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to deliver a specially crafted input to the affected software. No authentication is needed, but user interaction is required as the vulnerable code is typically triggered when a user processes a file.",
    "additional_notes": "The severity and exploitability depend on how the Outside In Technology code is used and whether data is directly passed to it over the network. If the data is not received over the network, the CVSS score might be lower."
