# Usage of non-constant time base64 decoder could lead to leakage of secret key material

Low

[poljar](/poljar)
published
GHSA-j8cm-g7r6-hfpq
Jul 17, 2024

## Package

cargo

vodozemac
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.7.0

## Patched versions

0.7.0

## Description

Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack.

### Impact

The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material.

The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes. Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper.

### Patches

The patch is in commit [734b6c6](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/commit/734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272).

### Workarounds

None.

### References

A detailed description of the precise attack can be found at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04600>. We kindly thank Soatok for pointing out this research to us.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at security at matrix.org.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-40640

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

fix: Use a constant-time Base64 encoder for secret key material

```
This patch fixes a security issue around a side-channel vulnerability[1]
when decoding secret key material using Base64.

In some circumstances an attacker can obtain information about secret
secret key material via a controlled-channel and side-channel attack.

This patch avoids the side-channel by switching to the base64ct crate
for the encoding, and more importantly, the decoding of secret key
material.

> Abstract:Implementations of cryptographic libraries have been scrutinized for secret-dependent execution behavior exploitable by microarchitectural side-channel attacks. To prevent unintended leakages, most libraries moved to constant-time implementations of cryptographic primitives. There have also been efforts to certify libraries for use in sensitive areas, like Microsoft CNG and Botan, with specific attention to leakage behavior.
>
> In this work, we show that a common oversight in these libraries is the existence of \emph{utility functions}, which handle and thus possibly leak confidential information. We analyze the exploitability of base64 decoding functions across several widely used cryptographic libraries. Base64 decoding is used when loading keys stored in PEM format. We show that these functions by themselves leak sufficient information even if libraries are executed in trusted execution environments. In fact, we show that recent countermeasures to transient execution attacks such as LVI \emph{ease} the exploitability of the observed faint leakages, allowing us to robustly infer sufficient information about RSA private keys \emph{with a single trace}. We present a complete attack, including a broad library analysis, a high-resolution last level cache attack on SGX enclaves, and a fully parallelized implementation of the extend-and-prune approach that allows a complete key recovery at medium costs.
