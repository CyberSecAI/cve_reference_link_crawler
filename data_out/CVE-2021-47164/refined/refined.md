The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47164.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `mlx5e_rep_changelowerstate_event` function within the Mellanox mlx5 driver due to a missing check for a null `lag_dev` pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access `lag_dev->name` without verifying that `lag_dev` is not NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: Accessing a null pointer will cause the kernel to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a lower state change event occurs on a network device. This can occur during bonding/enslaving operations with mlx5 devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to influence or trigger network device state changes on a system using the affected Mellanox mlx5 driver, specifically when using bonding.

**Additional details:**
- The `bond_enslave()` function sets the active/backup slave before setting the upper device. This causes an initial event with a null upper device. A second event with an upper device occurs after the `bond_master_upper_dev_link()` function is called. The vulnerability exists during the first event, where `lag_dev` is null.
- The fix adds a check to ensure `lag_dev` is not null before attempting to access its members.
