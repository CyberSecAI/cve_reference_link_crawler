Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection vulnerability located in the `/goform/Diagnosis` endpoint of the D-link DIR-816 router.
- The `sendNum` parameter, is not properly sanitized. This parameter is used in a `snprintf` function which then passes the output to a `system` call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application takes untrusted user-supplied input (the `sendNum` parameter) and uses it to construct a shell command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the router's operating system, leading to complete system compromise.
- Device takeover: The attacker can gain root access, potentially leading to further malicious activity such as:
    -  Data exfiltration,
    -  Botnet participation
    -  Malware installation.
- Denial of Service: Attackers can cause a device reboot, disrupting service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a POST request to the `/goform/Diagnosis` endpoint.
- Manipulation of `sendNum` parameter: The attacker includes malicious shell commands in the `sendNum` parameter within the POST data.
- Requires a valid tokenid parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically on the local network.
- Ability to retrieve the tokenid of a logged-in user by either sniffing network traffic or by visiting the login page.
- No authentication bypass is needed; the tokenid parameter acts as a primitive form of authentication, although it is vulnerable to the above attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The github content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in the D-link DIR-816 A2 router with firmware version `v1.10CNB04.img`. It is also confirmed to affect `DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB05`.
- The vulnerable code is in the `/goform/Diagnosis` handler, where the `setnum` variable, derived from the `sendNum` parameter, is used in `snprintf` and then passed to `system`.
