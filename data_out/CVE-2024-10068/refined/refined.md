The provided content describes a DLL hijacking vulnerability in OpenSight Software LLC FlashFXP 5.4.0.3970.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application loads a specific DLL (libcrypto-1_1.dll) from its directory. An attacker can replace this legitimate DLL with a malicious one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled search path: The application searches for the DLL in the application's directory, which is writable by the user, instead of system directories.
- DLL hijacking: By placing a malicious DLL with the same name in the directory, the attacker can cause the application to load their code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the FlashFXP application, gaining the same privileges as the user running the application.
- Complete compromise of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local file system: An attacker needs to have write access to the FlashFXP application directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to write files to the FlashFXP installation directory.
- The attacker must create a malicious DLL named `libcrypto-1_1.dll`.
