Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Broken Authentication vulnerability in the `/plugins/servlet/project-config/PROJECT/roles` endpoint.

*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the vulnerable endpoint `/plugins/servlet/project-config/PROJECT/roles` with a revoked administrator account.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs a Jira administrator account that has had its access revoked.
