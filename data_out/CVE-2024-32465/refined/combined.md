```

## DESCRIPTION

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates
remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
(visible using `git branch --remotes`), and creates and checks out an
initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s
currently active branch.

After the clone, a plain `git fetch` without arguments will update
all the remote-tracking branches, and a `git pull` without
arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the
current master branch, if any (this is untrue when `--single-branch`
is given; see below).

This default configuration is achieved by creating references to
the remote branch heads under `refs/remotes/origin` and
by initializing `remote.origin.url` and `remote.origin.fetch`
configuration variables.

## OPTIONS

 `-l`
 `--local`

When the repository to clone from is on a local machine,
this flag bypasses the normal "Git aware" transport
mechanism and clones the repository by making a copy of
`HEAD` and everything under objects and refs directories.
The files under `.git/objects/` directory are hardlinked
to save space when possible.

If the repository is specified as a local path (e.g., `/path/to/repo`),
this is the default, and --local is essentially a no-op. If the
repository is specified as a URL, then this flag is ignored (and we
never use the local optimizations). Specifying `--no-local` will
override the default when `/path/to/repo` is given, using the regular
Git transport instead.

If the repository’s `$GIT_DIR/objects` has symbolic links or is a
symbolic link, the clone will fail. This is a security measure to
prevent the unintentional copying of files by dereferencing the symbolic
links.

**NOTE**: this operation can race with concurrent modification to the
source repository, similar to running `cp -r src dst` while modifying
`src`.

 `--no-hardlinks`

Force the cloning process from a repository on a local
filesystem to copy the files under the `.git/objects`
directory instead of using hardlinks. This may be desirable
if you are trying to make a back-up of your repository.

 `-s`
 `--shared`

When the repository to clone is on the local machine,
instead of using hard links, automatically setup
`.git/objects/info/alternates` to share the objects
with the source repository. The resulting repository
starts out without any object of its own.

**NOTE**: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do **not** use
it unless you understand what it does. If you clone your
repository using this option and then delete branches (or use any
other Git command that makes any existing commit unreferenced) in the
source repository, some objects may become unreferenced (or dangling).
These objects may be removed by normal Git operations (such as `git commit`)
which automatically call `git maintenance run --auto`. (See
[git-maintenance[1]](/docs/git-maintenance).) If these objects are removed and were referenced
by the cloned repository, then the cloned repository will become corrupt.

Note that running `git repack` without the `--local` option in a repository
cloned with `--shared` will copy objects from the source repository into a pack
in the cloned repository, removing the disk space savings of `clone --shared`.
It is safe, however, to run `git gc`, which uses the `--local` option by
default.

If you want to break the dependency of a repository cloned with `--shared` on
its source repository, you can simply run `git repack -a` to copy all
objects from the source repository into a pack in the cloned repository.

 `--reference`[`-if-able`] *<repository>*

If the reference *<repository>* is on the local machine,
automatically setup `.git/objects/info/alternates` to
obtain objects from the reference *<repository>*. Using
an already existing repository as an alternate will
require fewer objects to be copied from the repository
being cloned, reducing network and local storage costs.
When using the `--reference-if-able`, a non existing
directory is skipped with a warning instead of aborting
the clone.

**NOTE**: see the NOTE for the `--shared` option, and also the
`--dissociate` option.

 `--dissociate`

Borrow the objects from reference repositories specified
with the `--reference` options only to reduce network
transfer, and stop borrowing from them after a clone is made
by making necessary local copies of borrowed objects. This
option can also be used when cloning locally from a
repository that already borrows objects from another
repository—​the new repository will borrow objects from the
same repository, and this option can be used to stop the
borrowing.

 `-q`
 `--quiet`

Operate quietly. Progress is not reported to the standard
error stream.

 `-v`
 `--verbose`

Run verbosely. Does not affect the reporting of progress status
to the standard error stream.

 `--progress`

Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless `--quiet`
is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

 `--server-option=`*<option>*

Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using
protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
character. The server’s handling of server options, including
unknown ones, is server-specific.
When multiple `--server-option=`*<option>* are given, they are all
sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line.

 `-n`
 `--no-checkout`

No checkout of HEAD is performed after the clone is complete.

 `--`[`no-`]`reject-shallow`

Fail if the source repository is a shallow repository.
The `clone.rejectShallow` configuration variable can be used to
specify the default.

 `--bare`

Make a *bare* Git repository. That is, instead of
creating *<directory>* and placing the administrative
files in *<directory>*`/.git`, make the *<directory>*
itself the `$GIT_DIR`. This obviously implies the `--no-checkout`
because there is nowhere to check out the working tree.
Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly
to corresponding local branch heads, without mapping
them to `refs/remotes/origin/`. When this option is
used, neither remote-tracking branches nor the related
configuration variables are created.

 `--sparse`

Employ a sparse-checkout, with only files in the toplevel
directory initially being present. The
[git-sparse-checkout[1]](/docs/git-sparse-checkout) command can be used to grow the
working directory as needed.

 `--filter=`*<filter-spec>*

Use the partial clone feature and request that the server sends
a subset of reachable objects according to a given object filter.
When using `--filter`, the supplied *<filter-spec>* is used for
the partial clone filter. For example, `--filter=blob:none` will
filter out all blobs (file contents) until needed by Git. Also,
`--filter=blob:limit=`*<size>* will filter out all blobs of size
at least *<size>*. For more details on filter specifications, see
the `--filter` option in [git-rev-list[1]](/docs/git-rev-list).

 `--also-filter-submodules`

Also apply the partial clone filter to any submodules in the repository.
Requires `--filter` and `--recurse-submodules`. This can be turned on by
default by setting the `clone.filterSubmodules` config option.

 `--mirror`

Set up a mirror of the source repository. This implies `--bare`.
Compared to `--bare`, `--mirror` not only maps local branches of the
source to local branches of the target, it maps all refs (including
remote-tracking branches, notes etc.) and sets up a refspec configuration such
that all these refs are overwritten by a `git remote update` in the
target repository.

 `-o` *<name>*
 `--origin` *<name>*

Instead of using the remote name `origin` to keep track of the upstream
repository, use *<name>*. Overrides `clone.defaultRemoteName` from the
config.

 `-b` *<name>*
 `--branch` *<name>*

Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed
to by the cloned repository’s HEAD, point to *<name>* branch
instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will
be checked out.
`--branch` can also take tags and detaches the HEAD at that commit
in the resulting repository.

 `-u` *<upload-pack>*
 `--upload-pack` *<upload-pack>*

When given, and the repository to clone from is accessed
via ssh, this specifies a non-default path for the command
run on the other end.

 `--template=`*<template-directory>*

Specify the directory from which templates will be used;
(See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init).)

 `-c` *<key>*`=`*<value>*
 `--config` *<key>*`=`*<value>*

Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository;
this takes effect immediately after the repository is
initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any
files checked out. The *<key>* is in the same format as expected by
[git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) (e.g., `core.eol=true`). If multiple
values are given for the same key, each value will be written to
the config file. This makes it safe, for example, to add
additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.

Due to limitations of the current implementation, some configuration
variables do not take effect until after the initial fetch and checkout.
Configuration variables known to not take effect are:
`remote.`*<name>*`.mirror` and `remote.`*<name>*`.tagOpt`. Use the
corresponding `--mirror` and `--no-tags` options instead.

 `--depth` *<depth>*

Create a *shallow* clone with a history truncated to the
specified number of commits. Implies `--single-branch` unless
`--no-single-branch` is given to fetch the histories near the
tips of all branches. If you want to clone submodules shallowly,
also pass `--shallow-submodules`.

 `--shallow-since=`*<date>*

Create a shallow clone with a history after the specified time.

 `--shallow-exclude=`*<revision>*

Create a shallow clone with a history, excluding commits
reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option
can be specified multiple times.

 `--`[`no-`]`single-branch`

Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
either specified by the `--branch` option or the primary
branch remote’s `HEAD` points at.
Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the
initial cloning. If the `HEAD` at the remote did not point at any
branch when `--single-branch` clone was made, no remote-tracking
branch is created.

 `--no-tags`

Don’t clone any tags, and set
`remote.<remote>.tagOpt=--no-tags` in the config, ensuring
that future `git pull` and `git fetch` operations won’t follow
any tags. Subsequent explicit tag fetches will still work,
(see [git-fetch[1]](/docs/git-fetch)).

Can be used in conjunction with `--single-branch` to clone and
maintain a branch with no references other than a single cloned
branch. This is useful e.g. to maintain minimal clones of the default
branch of some repository for search indexing.

 `--recurse-submodules`[`=`*<pathspec>*]

After the clone is created, initialize and clone submodules
within based on the provided *<pathspec>*. If no *=<pathspec>* is
provided, all submodules are initialized and cloned.
This option can be given multiple times for pathspecs consisting
of multiple entries. The resulting clone has `submodule.active` set to
the provided pathspec, or "." (meaning all submodules) if no
pathspec is provided.

Submodules are initialized and cloned using their default settings. This is
equivalent to running
`git submodule update --init --recursive <pathspec>` immediately after
the clone is finished. This option is ignored if the cloned repository does
not have a worktree/checkout (i.e. if any of `--no-checkout`/`-n`, `--bare`,
or `--mirror` is given)

 `--`[`no-`]`shallow-submodules`

All submodules which are cloned will be shallow with a depth of 1.

 `--`[`no-`]`remote-submodules`

All submodules which are cloned will use the status of the submodule’s
remote-tracking branch to update the submodule, rather than the
superproject’s recorded SHA-1. Equivalent to passing `--remote` to
`git submodule update`.

 `--separate-git-dir=`*<git-dir>*

Instead of placing the cloned repository where it is supposed
to be, place the cloned repository at the specified directory,
then make a filesystem-agnostic Git symbolic link to there.
The result is Git repository can be separated from working
tree.

 `--ref-format=`*<ref-format>*

Specify the given ref storage format for the repository. The valid values are:

* `files` for loose files with packed-refs. This is the default.
* `reftable` for the reftable format. This format is experimental and its
  internals are subject to change.

 `-j` *<n>*
 `--jobs` *<n>*

The number of submodules fetched at the same time.
Defaults to the `submodule.fetchJobs` option.

 *<repository>*

The (possibly remote) *<repository>* to clone from. See the
[GIT URLS](#URLS) section below for more information on specifying
repositories.

 *<directory>*

The name of a new directory to clone into. The "humanish"
part of the source repository is used if no *<directory>* is
explicitly given (`repo` for `/path/to/repo.git` and `foo`
for `host.xz:foo/.git`). Cloning into an existing directory
is only allowed if the directory is empty.

 `--bundle-uri=`*<uri>*

Before fetching from the remote, fetch a bundle from the given
*<uri>* and unbundle the data into the local repository. The refs
in the bundle will be stored under the hidden `refs/bundle/*`
namespace. This option is incompatible with `--depth`,
`--shallow-since`, and `--shallow-exclude`.

## GIT URLS

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp
and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
deprecated; do not use them).

The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

* `ssh://`[*<user>*`@`]*<host>*[`:`*<port>*]`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*
* `git://`*<host>*[:*<port>*]`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*
* `http`[`s`]`://`*<host>*[`:`*<port>*]`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*
* `ftp`[`s`]`://`*<host>*[`:`*<port>*]`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

* [*<user>*`@`]*<host>*`:/`*<path-to-git-repo>*

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path `foo:bar` could be specified as an
absolute path or `./foo:bar` to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support `~`*<username>* expansion:

* `ssh://`[*<user>*`@`]*<host>*[`:`*<port>*]`/~`*<user>*`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*
* `git://`*<host>*[`:`*<port>*]`/~`*<user>*`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*
* [*<user>*`@`]*<host>*`:~`*<user>*`/`*<path-to-git-repo>*

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:

* `/path/to/repo.git/`
* `<file:///path/to/repo.git/>`

These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the former implies
`--local` option.

`git clone`, `git fetch` and `git pull`, but not `git push`, will also
accept a suitable bundle file. See [git-bundle[1]](/docs/git-bundle).

When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the `remote-`*<transport>* remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:

* *<transport>*::*<address>*

where *<address>* may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See [gitremote-helpers[7]](/docs/gitremote-helpers) for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:

```
	[url "<actual-url-base>"]
		insteadOf = <other-url-base>
```

For example, with this:

```
	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:
```

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:

```
	[url "<actual-url-base>"]
		pushInsteadOf = <other-url-base>
```

For example, with this:

```
	[url "ssh://example.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
```

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.

## EXAMPLES

* Clone from upstream:

  ```
  $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux.git my-linux
  $ cd my-linux
  $ make
  ```
* Make a local clone that borrows from the current directory, without checking things out:

  ```
  $ git clone -l -s -n . ../copy
  $ cd ../copy
  $ git show-branch
  ```
* Clone from upstream while borrowing from an existing local directory:

  ```
  $ git clone --reference /git/linux.git \
  	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux.git \
  	my-linux
  $ cd my-linux
  ```
* Create a bare repository to publish your changes to the public:

  ```
  $ git clone --bare -l /home/proj/.git /pub/scm/proj.git
  ```

## CONFIGURATION

Everything below this line in this section is selectively included
from the [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) documentation. The content is the same
as what’s found there:

 `init.templateDir`

Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init).)

 `init.defaultBranch`

Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when initializing
a new repository.

 `init.defaultObjectFormat`

Allows overriding the default object format for new repositories. See
`--object-format=` in [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init). Both the command line option
and the `GIT_DEFAULT_HASH` environment variable take precedence over
this config.

 `init.defaultRefFormat`

Allows overriding the default ref storage format for new repositories.
See `--ref-format=` in [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init). Both the command line
option and the `GIT_DEFAULT_REF_FORMAT` environment variable take
precedence over this config.

 `clone.defaultRemoteName`

The name of the remote to create when cloning a repository. Defaults to
`origin`.
It can be overridden by passing the `--origin` command-line
option.

 `clone.rejectShallow`

Reject cloning a repository if it is a shallow one; this can be overridden by
passing the `--reject-shallow` option on the command line.

 `clone.filterSubmodules`

If a partial clone filter is provided (see `--filter` in
[git-rev-list[1]](/docs/git-rev-list)) and `--recurse-submodules` is used, also apply
the filter to submodules.

Subject: git: 5 vulnerabilities fixed

Team,

The Git project released new security bug-fix versions today, May 14th,
2024: v2.45.1, v2.44.1, v2.43.4, v2.42.2, v2.41.1, v2.40.2, and v2.39.4.

The addressed issues are:

 * CVE-2024-32002
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8h77-4q3w-gfgv>):

   Recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symbolic
   links are susceptible to case confusion that can be exploited to
   execute just-cloned code during the clone operation.

   This allows the attack where a recursive clone would first initialize a
   submodule, then replace its parent directory with a symbolic link into
   the `.git/` directory where the second stage of the recursive clone
   would then write e.g. hooks that would be immediately executed before
   the user has had a chance to inspect what is getting executed.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32004
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xfc6-vwr8-r389>):

   Repositories can be configured to execute arbitrary code during local
   clones. To address this, the ownership checks introduced in v2.30.3
   are now extended to cover cloning local repositories.

   The most obvious attack vector is to prepare a local partial clone that
   is intentionally missing objects, override in its config what
   `upload-pack` executable use, and then talk another user on the same
   machine to clone that. This will run that configured `upload-pack`
   executable under using person's permissions.

   Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Filip Hejsek, credit for
   fixing it goes to Johannes Schindelin.

 * CVE-2024-32020
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-5rfh-556j-fhgj>):

   Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
   object database when source and target repository reside on the same
   disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
   those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
   untrusted user.

   This vulnerability allows a bait-and-switch attack where individual
   objects are replaced in already-indexed pack file; Git will not verify
   that the object's contents match its recorded object ID in that case.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Patrick
   Steinhardt.

 * CVE-2024-32021
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7>):

   When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
   filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
   on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
   directory.

   This allows the same attack vector that CVE-2022-39253 tried to
   prevent, by exploiting a time-of-check-time-of-use race.

 * CVE-2024-32465
 * (<https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vm9j-46j9-qvq4>):

   It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories, even those
   unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted
   sources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the
   clone.

   The attack vectors are the same as for the CVEs mentioned above that
   involve local clones, but social-engineering is required to manipulate
   a user into unpacking a `.zip` file and running Git commands on the
   unpacked files.

   Credit for finding and for fixing the vulnerability goes to Jeff King.

Note: the defense-in-depth protection in these new Git versions causes a
regression when cloning repositories enabled with Git LFS. The clone will
fail with an error message. The remedy is to call `git lfs pull` in the
fresh clone.

Thanks,
Johannes

# Protections for cloning untrusted repositories can be bypassed

High

[dscho](/dscho)
published
GHSA-vm9j-46j9-qvq4
May 14, 2024

## Package

git

## Affected versions

v2.45.0 v2.44.0 <=v2.43.3 <=v2.42.1 v2.41.0 <=v2.40.1 <=v2.39.3

## Patched versions

v2.45.1 v2.44.1 v2.43.4 v2.42.2 v2.41.1 v2.40.2 v2.39.4

## Description

### Impact

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone them first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed.

In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004.

But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024.

### Workarounds

Avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : git
Version        : 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1387 CVE-2023-25652 CVE-2023-25815 CVE-2023-29007
                 CVE-2024-32002 CVE-2024-32004 CVE-2024-32021 CVE-2024-32465
Debian Bug     : 1034835 1071160

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in git, a fast, scalable and
distributed revision control system.

CVE-2019-1387

    It was possible to bypass the previous check for this vulnerability
    using parallel cloning, or the --recurse-submodules option to
    git-checkout(1).

CVE-2023-25652

    Feeding specially-crafted input to 'git apply --reject' could
    overwrite a path outside the working tree with partially controlled
    contents, corresponding to the rejected hunk or hunks from the given
    patch.

CVE-2023-25815

    Low-privileged users could inject malicious messages into Git's
    output under MINGW.

CVE-2023-29007

    A specially-crafted .gitmodules file with submodule URLs longer than
    1024 characters could be used to inject arbitrary configuration into
    $GIT_DIR/config.

CVE-2024-32002

    Repositories with submodules could be specially-crafted to write
    hooks into .git/ which would then be executed during an ongoing
    clone operation.

CVE-2024-32004

    A specially-crafted local repository could cause the execution of
    arbitrary code when cloned by another user.

CVE-2024-32021

    When cloning a local repository that contains symlinks via the
    filesystem, Git could have created hardlinks to arbitrary
    user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository
    in the objects/ directory.

CVE-2024-32465

    When cloning a local repository obtained from a downloaded archive,
    hooks in that repository could be used for arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.20.1-2+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

For the detailed security status of git please refer to
its security tracker page at:

## NAME

git - the stupid content tracker

## SYNOPSIS

```
git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
    [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
    [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--no-lazy-fetch]
    [--no-optional-locks] [--no-advice] [--bare] [--git-dir=<path>]
    [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
    <command> [<args>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.

See [gittutorial[7]](/docs/gittutorial) to get started, then see
[giteveryday[7]](/docs/giteveryday) for a useful minimum set of
commands. The [Git User’s Manual](/docs/user-manual) has a more
in-depth introduction.

After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this
page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about
individual Git commands with "git help command". [gitcli[7]](/docs/gitcli)
manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation
can be viewed at <https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html>
or <https://git-scm.com/docs>.

## OPTIONS

 -v
 --version

Prints the Git suite version that the *git* program came from.

This option is internally converted to `git version ...` and accepts
the same options as the [git-version[1]](/docs/git-version) command. If `--help` is
also given, it takes precedence over `--version`.

 -h
 --help

Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used
commands. If the option `--all` or `-a` is given then all
available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this
option will bring up the manual page for that command.

Other options are available to control how the manual page is
displayed. See [git-help[1]](/docs/git-help) for more information,
because `git --help ...` is converted internally into `git
help ...`.

 -C <path>

Run as if git was started in *<path>* instead of the current working
directory. When multiple `-C` options are given, each subsequent
non-absolute `-C <path>` is interpreted relative to the preceding `-C
<path>`. If *<path>* is present but empty, e.g. `-C ""`, then the
current working directory is left unchanged.

This option affects options that expect path name like `--git-dir` and
`--work-tree` in that their interpretations of the path names would be
made relative to the working directory caused by the `-C` option. For
example the following invocations are equivalent:

```
git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status
```

 -c <name>=<value>

Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value
given will override values from configuration files.
The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by
*git config* (subkeys separated by dots).

Note that omitting the `=` in `git -c foo.bar ...` is allowed and sets
`foo.bar` to the boolean true value (just like `[foo]bar` would in a
config file). Including the equals but with an empty value (like `git -c
foo.bar= ...`) sets `foo.bar` to the empty string which `git config
--type=bool` will convert to `false`.

 --config-env=<name>=<envvar>

Like `-c <name>=<value>`, give configuration variable
*<name>* a value, where <envvar> is the name of an
environment variable from which to retrieve the value. Unlike
`-c` there is no shortcut for directly setting the value to an
empty string, instead the environment variable itself must be
set to the empty string. It is an error if the `<envvar>` does not exist
in the environment. `<envvar>` may not contain an equals sign
to avoid ambiguity with `<name>` containing one.

This is useful for cases where you want to pass transitory
configuration options to git, but are doing so on operating systems
where other processes might be able to read your command line
(e.g. `/proc/self/cmdline`), but not your environment
(e.g. `/proc/self/environ`). That behavior is the default on
Linux, but may not be on your system.

Note that this might add security for variables such as
`http.extraHeader` where the sensitive information is part of
the value, but not e.g. `url.<base>.insteadOf` where the
sensitive information can be part of the key.

 --exec-path[=<path>]

Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed.
This can also be controlled by setting the GIT\_EXEC\_PATH
environment variable. If no path is given, *git* will print
the current setting and then exit.

 --html-path

Print the path, without trailing slash, where Git’s HTML
documentation is installed and exit.

 --man-path

Print the manpath (see `man(1)`) for the man pages for
this version of Git and exit.

 --info-path

Print the path where the Info files documenting this
version of Git are installed and exit.

 -p
 --paginate

Pipe all output into *less* (or if set, $PAGER) if standard
output is a terminal. This overrides the `pager.<cmd>`
configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section
below).

 -P
 --no-pager

Do not pipe Git output into a pager.

 --git-dir=<path>

Set the path to the repository (".git" directory). This can also be
controlled by setting the `GIT_DIR` environment variable. It can be
an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.

Specifying the location of the ".git" directory using this
option (or `GIT_DIR` environment variable) turns off the
repository discovery that tries to find a directory with
".git" subdirectory (which is how the repository and the
top-level of the working tree are discovered), and tells Git
that you are at the top level of the working tree. If you
are not at the top-level directory of the working tree, you
should tell Git where the top-level of the working tree is,
with the `--work-tree=<path>` option (or `GIT_WORK_TREE`
environment variable)

If you just want to run git as if it was started in `<path>` then use
`git -C <path>`.

 --work-tree=<path>

Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path
or a path relative to the current working directory.
This can also be controlled by setting the GIT\_WORK\_TREE
environment variable and the core.worktree configuration
variable (see core.worktree in [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) for a
more detailed discussion).

 --namespace=<path>

Set the Git namespace. See [gitnamespaces[7]](/docs/gitnamespaces) for more
details. Equivalent to setting the `GIT_NAMESPACE` environment
variable.

 --bare

Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT\_DIR
environment is not set, it is set to the current working
directory.

 --no-replace-objects

Do not use replacement refs to replace Git objects.
This is equivalent to exporting the `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`
environment variable with any value.
See [git-replace[1]](/docs/git-replace) for more information.

 --no-lazy-fetch

Do not fetch missing objects from the promisor remote on
demand. Useful together with `git cat-file -e <object>` to
see if the object is locally available.
This is equivalent to setting the `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH`
environment variable to `1`.

 --no-optional-locks

Do not perform optional operations that require locks. This is
equivalent to setting the `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS` to `0`.

 --no-advice

Disable all advice hints from being printed.

 --literal-pathspecs

Treat pathspecs literally (i.e. no globbing, no pathspec magic).
This is equivalent to setting the `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS` environment
variable to `1`.

 --glob-pathspecs

Add "glob" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
the `GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`. Disabling
globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec
magic ":(literal)"

 --noglob-pathspecs

Add "literal" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
the `GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`. Enabling
globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec
magic ":(glob)"

 --icase-pathspecs

Add "icase" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
the `GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`.

 --list-cmds=<group>[,<group>…​]

List commands by group. This is an internal/experimental
option and may change or be removed in the future. Supported
groups are: builtins, parseopt (builtin commands that use
parse-options), main (all commands in libexec directory),
others (all other commands in `$PATH` that have git- prefix),
list-<category> (see categories in command-list.txt),
nohelpers (exclude helper commands), alias and config
(retrieve command list from config variable completion.commands)

 --attr-source=<tree-ish>

Read gitattributes from <tree-ish> instead of the worktree. See
[gitattributes[5]](/docs/gitattributes). This is equivalent to setting the
`GIT_ATTR_SOURCE` environment variable.

## GIT COMMANDS

We divide Git into high level ("porcelain") commands and low level
("plumbing") commands.

## High-level commands (porcelain)

We separate the porcelain commands into the main commands and some
ancillary user utilities.

* [git-revert[1]](/docs/git-revert) is about making a new commit that reverts the
  changes made by other commits.
* [git-restore[1]](/docs/git-restore) is about restoring files in the working tree
  from either the index or another commit. This command does not
  update your branch. The command can also be used to restore files in
  the index from another commit.
* [git-reset[1]](/docs/git-reset) is about updating your branch, moving the tip
  in order to add or remove commits from the branch. This operation
  changes the commit history.

  `git reset` can also be used to restore the index, overlapping with
  `git restore`.

## Low-level commands (plumbing)

Although Git includes its
own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support
development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains
might start by reading about [git-update-index[1]](/docs/git-update-index) and
[git-read-tree[1]](/docs/git-read-tree).

The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics)
to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable
than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are
primarily for scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands
on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the
end user experience.

The following description divides
the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in
the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and
compare objects, and commands that move objects and references between
repositories.

## Configuration Mechanism

Git uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per
repository and are per user. Such a configuration file may look
like this:

```
#
# A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
#

; core variables
[core]
	; Don't trust file modes
	filemode = false

; user identity
[user]
	name = "Junio C Hamano"
	email = "gitster@pobox.com"
```

Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust
their operation accordingly. See [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) for a
list and more details about the configuration mechanism.

## Identifier Terminology

 <object>

Indicates the object name for any type of object.

 <blob>

Indicates a blob object name.

 <tree>

Indicates a tree object name.

 <commit>

Indicates a commit object name.

 <tree-ish>

Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A
command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to
operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences
<commit> and <tag> objects that point at a <tree>.

 <commit-ish>

Indicates a commit or tag object name. A
command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to
operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences
<tag> objects that point at a <commit>.

 <type>

Indicates that an object type is required.
Currently one of: `blob`, `tree`, `commit`, or `tag`.

 <file>

Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the
root of the tree structure `GIT_INDEX_FILE` describes.

## Symbolic Identifiers

Any Git command accepting any <object> can also use the following
symbolic notation:

 HEAD

indicates the head of the current branch.

 <tag>

a valid tag *name*
(i.e. a `refs/tags/<tag>` reference).

 <head>

a valid head *name*
(i.e. a `refs/heads/<head>` reference).

For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in [gitrevisions[7]](/docs/gitrevisions).

## File/Directory Structure

Please see the [gitrepository-layout[5]](/docs/gitrepository-layout) document.

Read [githooks[5]](/docs/githooks) for more details about each hook.

Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the
`$GIT_DIR`.

## Terminology

Please see [gitglossary[7]](/docs/gitglossary).

## Environment Variables

Various Git commands pay attention to environment variables and change
their behavior. The environment variables marked as "Boolean" take
their values the same way as Boolean valued configuration variables, e.g.
"true", "yes", "on" and positive numbers are taken as "yes".

Here are the variables:

### The Git Repository

These environment variables apply to *all* core Git commands. Nb: it
is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above
Git so take care if using a foreign front-end.

 `GIT_INDEX_FILE`

This environment variable specifies an alternate
index file. If not specified, the default of `$GIT_DIR/index`
is used.

 `GIT_INDEX_VERSION`

This environment variable specifies what index version is used
when writing the index file out. It won’t affect existing index
files. By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See
[git-update-index[1]](/docs/git-update-index) for more information.

 `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`

If the object storage directory is specified via this
environment variable then the sha1 directories are created
underneath - otherwise the default `$GIT_DIR/objects`
directory is used.

 `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`

Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be
archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable
specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list
of Git object directories which can be used to search for Git
objects. New objects will not be written to these directories.

Entries that begin with `"` (double-quote) will be interpreted
as C-style quoted paths, removing leading and trailing
double-quotes and respecting backslash escapes. E.g., the value
`"path-with-\"-and-:-in-it":vanilla-path` has two paths:
`path-with-"-and-:-in-it` and `vanilla-path`.

 `GIT_DIR`

If the `GIT_DIR` environment variable is set then it
specifies a path to use instead of the default `.git`
for the base of the repository.
The `--git-dir` command-line option also sets this value.

 `GIT_WORK_TREE`

Set the path to the root of the working tree.
This can also be controlled by the `--work-tree` command-line
option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

 `GIT_NAMESPACE`

Set the Git namespace; see [gitnamespaces[7]](/docs/gitnamespaces) for details.
The `--namespace` command-line option also sets this value.

 `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`

This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If
set, it is a list of directories that Git should not chdir up
into while looking for a repository directory (useful for
excluding slow-loading network directories). It will not
exclude the current working directory or a GIT\_DIR set on the
command line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read
the entries in this list and resolve any symlink that
might be present in order to compare them with the current
directory. However, if even this access is slow, you
can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the
subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn’t be resolved;
e.g.,
`GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink`.

 `GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM`

When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository
directory, Git tries to find such a directory in the parent
directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it
does not cross filesystem boundaries. This Boolean environment variable
can be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem
boundaries. Like `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`, this will not affect
an explicit repository directory set via `GIT_DIR` or on the
command line.

 `GIT_COMMON_DIR`

If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are
normally in $GIT\_DIR will be taken from this path
instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are
taken from $GIT\_DIR. See [gitrepository-layout[5]](/docs/gitrepository-layout) and
[git-worktree[1]](/docs/git-worktree) for
details. This variable has lower precedence than other path
variables such as GIT\_INDEX\_FILE, GIT\_OBJECT\_DIRECTORY…​

 `GIT_DEFAULT_HASH`

If this variable is set, the default hash algorithm for new
repositories will be set to this value. This value is
ignored when cloning and the setting of the remote repository
is always used. The default is "sha1".
See `--object-format` in [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init).

 `GIT_DEFAULT_REF_FORMAT`

If this variable is set, the default reference backend format for new
repositories will be set to this value. The default is "files".
See `--ref-format` in [git-init[1]](/docs/git-init).

### Git Commits

 `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`

The human-readable name used in the author identity when creating commit or
tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.name` and
`author.name` configuration settings.

 `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`

The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or
tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.email` and
`author.email` configuration settings.

 `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE`

The date used for the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or
when writing reflogs. See [git-commit[1]](/docs/git-commit) for valid formats.

 `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`

The human-readable name used in the committer identity when creating commit or
tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.name` and
`committer.name` configuration settings.

 `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`

The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or
tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.email` and
`committer.email` configuration settings.

 `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`

The date used for the committer identity when creating commit or tag objects, or
when writing reflogs. See [git-commit[1]](/docs/git-commit) for valid formats.

 `EMAIL`

The email address used in the author and committer identities if no other
relevant environment variable or configuration setting has been set.

### Git Diffs

 `GIT_DIFF_OPTS`

Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the
number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created.
This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option
value passed on the Git diff command line.

 `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`

When the environment variable `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is set, the
program named by it is called to generate diffs, and Git
does not use its builtin diff machinery.
For a path that is added, removed, or modified,
`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called with 7 parameters:

```
path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
```

where:

 <old|new>-file

are files GIT\_EXTERNAL\_DIFF can use to read the
contents of <old|new>,

 <old|new>-hex

are the 40-hexdigit SHA-1 hashes,

 <old|new>-mode

are the octal representation of the file modes.

The file parameters can point at the user’s working file
(e.g. `new-file` in "git-diff-files"), `/dev/null` (e.g. `old-file`
when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g. `old-file` in the
index). `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` should not worry about unlinking the
temporary file — it is removed when `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` exits.

For a path that is unmerged, `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called with 1
parameter, <path>.

For each path `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called, two environment variables,
`GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER` and `GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL` are set.

 `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_TRUST_EXIT_CODE`

If this Boolean environment variable is set to true then the
`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` command is expected to return exit code
0 if it considers the input files to be equal or 1 if it
considers them to be different, like `diff(1)`.
If it is set to false, which is the default, then the command
is expected to return exit code 0 regardless of equality.
Any other exit code causes Git to report a fatal error.

 `GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER`

A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

 `GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL`

The total number of paths.

### other

 `GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY`

A number controlling the amount of output shown by
the recursive merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity.
See [git-merge[1]](/docs/git-merge)

 `GIT_PAGER`

This environment variable overrides `$PAGER`. If it is set
to an empty string or to the value "cat", Git will not launch
a pager. See also the `core.pager` option in
[git-config[1]](/docs/git-config).

 `GIT_PROGRESS_DELAY`

A number controlling how many seconds to delay before showing
optional progress indicators. Defaults to 2.

 `GIT_EDITOR`

This environment variable overrides `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`.
It is used by several Git commands when, on interactive mode,
an editor is to be launched. See also [git-var[1]](/docs/git-var)
and the `core.editor` option in [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config).

 `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`

This environment variable overrides the configured Git editor
when editing the todo list of an interactive rebase. See also
[git-rebase[1]](/docs/git-rebase) and the `sequence.editor` option in
[git-config[1]](/docs/git-config).

 `GIT_SSH`
 `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`

If either of these environment variables is set then *git fetch*
and *git push* will use the specified command instead of *ssh*
when they need to connect to a remote system.
The command-line parameters passed to the configured command are
determined by the ssh variant. See `ssh.variant` option in
[git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) for details.

`$GIT_SSH_COMMAND` takes precedence over `$GIT_SSH`, and is interpreted
by the shell, which allows additional arguments to be included.
`$GIT_SSH` on the other hand must be just the path to a program
(which can be a wrapper shell script, if additional arguments are
needed).

Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your
personal `.ssh/config` file. Please consult your ssh documentation
for further details.

 `GIT_SSH_VARIANT`

If this environment variable is set, it overrides Git’s autodetection
whether `GIT_SSH`/`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`/`core.sshCommand` refer to OpenSSH,
plink or tortoiseplink. This variable overrides the config setting
`ssh.variant` that serves the same purpose.

 `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY`

Setting and exporting this environment variable to any value
tells Git not to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or
pushing over HTTPS.

 `GIT_ATTR_SOURCE`

Sets the treeish that gitattributes will be read from.

 `GIT_ASKPASS`

If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need to
acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication)
will call this program with a suitable prompt as command-line argument
and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the `core.askPass`
option in [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config).

 `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`

If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, git will not prompt
on the terminal (e.g., when asking for HTTP authentication).

 `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`
 `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`

Take the configuration from the given files instead from global or
system-level configuration files. If `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` is set, the
system config file defined at build time (usually `/etc/gitconfig`)
will not be read. Likewise, if `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` is set, neither
`$HOME/.gitconfig` nor `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` will be read. Can
be set to `/dev/null` to skip reading configuration files of the
respective level.

 `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`

Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
`$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig` file. This Boolean environment variable can
be used along with `$HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to create a
predictable environment for a picky script, or you can set it
to true to temporarily avoid using a buggy `/etc/gitconfig` file while
waiting for someone with sufficient permissions to fix it.

 `GIT_FLUSH`

If this Boolean environment variable is set to true, then commands such
as *git blame* (in incremental mode), *git rev-list*, *git log*,
*git check-attr* and *git check-ignore* will
force a flush of the output stream after each record have been
flushed. If this
variable is set to false, the output of these commands will be done
using completely buffered I/O. If this environment variable is
not set, Git will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing
based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

 `GIT_TRACE`

Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in
command execution and external command execution.

If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison
is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to
stderr.

If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2
and lower than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this
value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the
trace messages into this file descriptor.

Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path
(starting with a */* character), Git will interpret this
as a file path and will try to append the trace messages
to it.

Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or
"false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

 `GIT_TRACE_FSMONITOR`

Enables trace messages for the filesystem monitor extension.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS`

Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each
access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is
recorded. This may be helpful for troubleshooting some
pack-related performance problems.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_PACKET`

Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a
given program. This can help with debugging object negotiation
or other protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet
starting with "PACK" (but see `GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE` below).
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE`

Enables tracing of packfiles sent or received by a
given program. Unlike other trace output, this trace is
verbatim: no headers, and no quoting of binary data. You almost
certainly want to direct into a file (e.g.,
`GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE=/tmp/my.pack`) rather than displaying it on
the terminal or mixing it with other trace output.

Note that this is currently only implemented for the client side
of clones and fetches.

 `GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE`

Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution
time of each Git command.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_REFS`

Enables trace messages for operations on the ref database.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_SETUP`

Enables trace messages printing the .git, working tree and current
working directory after Git has completed its setup phase.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_SHALLOW`

Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching /
cloning of shallow repositories.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_CURL`

Enables a curl full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
including descriptive information, of the git transport protocol.
This is similar to doing curl `--trace-ascii` on the command line.
See `GIT_TRACE` for available trace output options.

 `GIT_TRACE_CURL_NO_DATA`

When a curl trace is enabled (see `GIT_TRACE_CURL` above), do not dump
data (that is, only dump info lines and headers).

 `GIT_TRACE2`

Enables more detailed trace messages from the "trace2" library.
Output from `GIT_TRACE2` is a simple text-based format for human
readability.

If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison
is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to
stderr.

If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2
and lower than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this
value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the
trace messages into this file descriptor.

Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path
(starting with a */* character), Git will interpret this
as a file path and will try to append the trace messages
to it. If the path already exists and is a directory, the
trace messages will be written to files (one per process)
in that directory, named according to the last component
of the SID and an optional counter (to avoid filename
collisions).

In addition, if the variable is set to
`af_unix:[<socket-type>:]<absolute-pathname>`, Git will try
to open the path as a Unix Domain Socket. The socket type
can be either `stream` or `dgram`.

Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or
"false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

See [Trace2 documentation](/docs/api-trace2)
for full details.

 `GIT_TRACE2_EVENT`

This setting writes a JSON-based format that is suited for machine
interpretation.
See `GIT_TRACE2` for available trace output options and
[Trace2 documentation](/docs/api-trace2) for full details.

 `GIT_TRACE2_PERF`

In addition to the text-based messages available in `GIT_TRACE2`, this
setting writes a column-based format for understanding nesting
regions.
See `GIT_TRACE2` for available trace output options and
[Trace2 documentation](/docs/api-trace2) for full details.

 `GIT_TRACE_REDACT`

By default, when tracing is activated, Git redacts the values of
cookies, the "Authorization:" header, the "Proxy-Authorization:"
header and packfile URIs. Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent this
redaction.

 `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`

Setting and exporting this environment variable tells Git to
ignore replacement refs and do not replace Git objects.

 `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS`

Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all
pathspecs literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example,
running `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c'` will search
for commits that touch the path `*.c`, not any paths that the
glob `*.c` matches. You might want this if you are feeding
literal paths to Git (e.g., paths previously given to you by
`git ls-tree`, `--raw` diff output, etc).

 `GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS`

Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all
pathspecs as glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

 `GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS`

Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all
pathspecs as literal (aka "literal" magic).

 `GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS`

Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all
pathspecs as case-insensitive.

 `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH`

Setting this Boolean environment variable to true tells Git
not to lazily fetch missing objects from the promisor remote
on demand.

 `GIT_REFLOG_ACTION`

When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep
track of the reason why the ref was updated (which is
typically the name of the high-level command that updated
the ref), in addition to the old and new values of the ref.
A scripted Porcelain command can use set\_reflog\_action
helper function in `git-sh-setup` to set its name to this
variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the
end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

 `GIT_REF_PARANOIA`

If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, ignore broken or badly named refs when iterating
over lists of refs. Normally Git will try to include any such
refs, which may cause some operations to fail. This is usually
preferable, as potentially destructive operations (e.g.,
[git-prune[1]](/docs/git-prune)) are better off aborting rather than
ignoring broken refs (and thus considering the history they
point to as not worth saving). The default value is `1` (i.e.,
be paranoid about detecting and aborting all operations). You
should not normally need to set this to `0`, but it may be
useful when trying to salvage data from a corrupted repository.

 `GIT_COMMIT_GRAPH_PARANOIA`

When loading a commit object from the commit-graph, Git performs an
existence check on the object in the object database. This is done to
avoid issues with stale commit-graphs that contain references to
already-deleted commits, but comes with a performance penalty.

The default is "false", which disables the aforementioned behavior.
Setting this to "true" enables the existence check so that stale commits
will never be returned from the commit-graph at the cost of performance.

 `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`

If set to a colon-separated list of protocols, behave as if
`protocol.allow` is set to `never`, and each of the listed
protocols has `protocol.<name>.allow` set to `always`
(overriding any existing configuration). See the description of
`protocol.allow` in [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) for more details.

 `GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER`

Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent protocols used by fetch/push/clone which are
configured to the `user` state. This is useful to restrict recursive
submodule initialization from an untrusted repository or for programs
which feed potentially-untrusted URLS to git commands. See
[git-config[1]](/docs/git-config) for more details.

 `GIT_PROTOCOL`

For internal use only. Used in handshaking the wire protocol.
Contains a colon *:* separated list of keys with optional values
*<key>[=<value>]*. Presence of unknown keys and values must be
ignored.

Note that servers may need to be configured to allow this variable to
pass over some transports. It will be propagated automatically when
accessing local repositories (i.e., `file://` or a filesystem path), as
well as over the `git://` protocol. For git-over-http, it should work
automatically in most configurations, but see the discussion in
[git-http-backend[1]](/docs/git-http-backend). For git-over-ssh, the ssh server may need
to be configured to allow clients to pass this variable (e.g., by using
`AcceptEnv GIT_PROTOCOL` with OpenSSH).

This configuration is optional. If the variable is not propagated, then
clients will fall back to the original "v0" protocol (but may miss out
on some performance improvements or features). This variable currently
only affects clones and fetches; it is not yet used for pushes (but may
be in the future).

 `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`

If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, Git will complete any requested operation without
performing any optional sub-operations that require taking a lock.
For example, this will prevent `git status` from refreshing the
index as a side effect. This is useful for processes running in
the background which do not want to cause lock contention with
other operations on the repository. Defaults to `1`.

 `GIT_REDIRECT_STDIN`
 `GIT_REDIRECT_STDOUT`
 `GIT_REDIRECT_STDERR`

Windows-only: allow redirecting the standard input/output/error
handles to paths specified by the environment variables. This is
particularly useful in multi-threaded applications where the
canonical way to pass standard handles via `CreateProcess()` is
not an option because it would require the handles to be marked
inheritable (and consequently **every** spawned process would
inherit them, possibly blocking regular Git operations). The
primary intended use case is to use named pipes for communication
(e.g. `\\.\pipe\my-git-stdin-123`).

Two special values are supported: `off` will simply close the
corresponding standard handle, and if `GIT_REDIRECT_STDERR` is
`2>&1`, standard error will be redirected to the same handle as
standard output.

 `GIT_PRINT_SHA1_ELLIPSIS` (deprecated)

If set to `yes`, print an ellipsis following an
(abbreviated) SHA-1 value. This affects indications of
detached HEADs ([git-checkout[1]](/docs/git-checkout)) and the raw
diff output ([git-diff[1]](/docs/git-diff)). Printing an
ellipsis in the cases mentioned is no longer considered
adequate and support for it is likely to be removed in the
foreseeable future (along with the variable).

 `GIT_ADVICE`

If set to `0`, then disable all advice messages. These messages are
intended to provide hints to human users that may help them get out of
problematic situations or take advantage of new features. Users can
disable individual messages using the `advice.*` config keys. These
messages may be disruptive to tools that execute Git processes, so this
variable is available to disable the messages. (The `--no-advice`
global option is also available, but old Git versions may fail when
this option is not understood. The environment variable will be ignored
by Git versions that do not understand it.)

## Discussion

More detail on the following is available from the
[Git concepts chapter of the
user-manual](/docs/user-manual#git-concepts) and [gitcore-tutorial[7]](/docs/gitcore-tutorial).

A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git"
subdirectory at the top level. The .git directory contains, among other
things, a compressed object database representing the complete history
of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current
contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such
as tags and branch heads.

The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which
hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up
directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree
and some number of parent commits.

The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or
"version", represents a step in the project’s history, and each parent
represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more than one
parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally
written as a string of 40 hex digits. Such names are globally unique.
The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing
just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this
purpose.

When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for
efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files".

Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref
may contain the SHA-1 name of an object or the name of another ref (the
latter is called a "symbolic ref").
Refs with names beginning `refs/head/` contain the SHA-1 name of the most
recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA-1 names of
tags of interest are stored under `refs/tags/`. A symbolic ref named
`HEAD` contains the name of the currently checked-out branch.

The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each
path, a blob object and a set of attributes. The blob object represents
the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch. The
attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the
corresponding file in the working tree. Subsequent changes to the
working tree can be found by comparing these attributes. The index may
be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the
content stored in the index.

The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages")
for a given pathname. These stages are used to hold the various
unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.

## SECURITY

Some configuration options and hook files may cause Git to run arbitrary
shell commands. Because configuration and hooks are not copied using
`git clone`, it is generally safe to clone remote repositories with
untrusted content, inspect them with `git log`, and so on.

However, it is not safe to run Git commands in a `.git` directory (or
the working tree that surrounds it) when that `.git` directory itself
comes from an untrusted source. The commands in its config and hooks
are executed in the usual way.

By default, Git will refuse to run when the repository is owned by
someone other than the user running the command. See the entry for
`safe.directory` in [git-config[1]](/docs/git-config). While this can help protect
you in a multi-user environment, note that you can also acquire
untrusted repositories that are owned by you (for example, if you
extract a zip file or tarball from an untrusted source). In such cases,
you’d need to "sanitize" the untrusted repository first.

If you have an untrusted `.git` directory, you should first clone it
with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git does restrict
the set of options and hooks that will be run by `upload-pack`, which
handles the server side of a clone or fetch, but beware that the
surface area for attack against `upload-pack` is large, so this does
carry some risk. The safest thing is to serve the repository as an
unprivileged user (either via [git-daemon[1]](/docs/git-daemon), ssh, or using
other tools to change user ids). See the discussion in the `SECURITY`
section of [git-upload-pack[1]](/docs/git-upload-pack).

## FURTHER DOCUMENTATION

See the references in the "description" section to get started
using Git. The following is probably more detail than necessary
for a first-time user.

The [Git concepts chapter of the
user-manual](/docs/user-manual#git-concepts) and [gitcore-tutorial[7]](/docs/gitcore-tutorial) both provide
introductions to the underlying Git architecture.

See [gitworkflows[7]](/docs/gitworkflows) for an overview of recommended workflows.

See also the [howto](/docs/howto-index) documents for some useful
examples.

The internals are documented in the
[Git API documentation](/docs/api-index).

Users migrating from CVS may also want to
read [gitcvs-migration[7]](/docs/gitcvs-migration).

## Authors

Git was started by Linus Torvalds, and is currently maintained by Junio
C Hamano. Numerous contributions have come from the Git mailing list
<git@vger.kernel.org>. <https://openhub.net/p/git/contributors/summary>
gives you a more complete list of contributors.

If you have a clone of git.git itself, the
output of [git-shortlog[1]](/docs/git-shortlog) and [git-blame[1]](/docs/git-blame) can show you
the authors for specific parts of the project.

## Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Git mailing list <git@vger.kernel.org> where the
development and maintenance is primarily done. You do not have to be
subscribed to the list to send a message there. See the list archive

The upload-pack command tries to avoid trusting the repository in which
it's run (e.g., by not running any hooks and not using any config that
contains arbitrary commands). But if the server side of a fetch or a
clone is a partial clone, then either upload-pack or its child
pack-objects may run a lazy "git fetch" under the hood. And it is very
easy to convince fetch to run arbitrary commands.

The "server" side can be a local repository owned by someone else, who
would be able to configure commands that are run during a clone with the
current user's permissions. This issue has been designated
CVE-2024-32004.

The fix in this commit's parent helps in this scenario, as well as in
related scenarios using SSH to clone, where the untrusted .git directory
is owned by a different user id. But if you received one as a zip file,
on a USB stick, etc, it may be owned by your user but still untrusted.

This has been designated CVE-2024-32465.

To mitigate the issue more completely, let's disable lazy fetching
entirely during `upload-pack`. While fetching from a partial repository
should be relatively rare, it is certainly not an unreasonable workflow.
And thus we need to provide an escape hatch.

This commit works by respecting a GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH environment variable
(to skip the lazy-fetch), and setting it in upload-pack, but only when
the user has not already done so (which gives us the escape hatch).

The name of the variable is specifically chosen to match what has
already been added in 'master' via [e6d5479](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6d5479e7ac301ae8d11daa3d8ef748e891c91c3) (git: extend
--no-lazy-fetch to work across subprocesses, 2024-02-27). Since we're
building this fix as a backport for older versions, we could cherry-pick
that patch and its earlier steps. However, we don't really need the
niceties (like a "--no-lazy-fetch" option) that it offers. By using the
same name, everything should just work when the two are eventually
merged, but here are a few notes:

  - the blocking of the fetch in [e6d5479](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6d5479e7ac301ae8d11daa3d8ef748e891c91c3) is incomplete! It sets
    fetch_if_missing to 0 when we setup the repository variable, but
    that isn't enough. pack-objects in particular will call
    prefetch_to_pack() even if that variable is 0. This patch by
    contrast checks the environment variable at the lowest level before
    we call the lazy fetch, where we can be sure to catch all code
    paths.

    Possibly the setting of fetch_if_missing from [e6d5479](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6d5479e7ac301ae8d11daa3d8ef748e891c91c3) can be
    reverted, but it may be useful to have. For example, some code may
    want to use that flag to change behavior before it gets to the point
    of trying to start the fetch. At any rate, that's all outside the
    scope of this patch.

  - there's documentation for GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH in [e6d5479](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6d5479e7ac301ae8d11daa3d8ef748e891c91c3). We can
    live without that here, because for the most part the user shouldn't
    need to set it themselves. The exception is if they do want to
    override upload-pack's default, and that requires a separate
    documentation section (which is added here)

  - it would be nice to use the NO_LAZY_FETCH_ENVIRONMENT macro added by
    [e6d5479](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6d5479e7ac301ae8d11daa3d8ef748e891c91c3), but those definitions have moved from cache.h to
    environment.h between 2.39.3 and master. I just used the raw string
    literals, and we can replace them with the macro once this topic is
    merged to master.

At least with respect to CVE-2024-32004, this does render this commit's
parent commit somewhat redundant. However, it is worth retaining that
commit as defense in depth, and because it may help other issues (e.g.,
symlink/hardlink TOCTOU races, where zip files are not really an
interesting attack vector).

The tests in t0411 still pass, but now we have _two_ mechanisms ensuring
that the evil command is not run. Let's beef up the existing ones to
check that they failed for the expected reason, that we refused to run
upload-pack at all with an alternate user id. And add two new ones for
the same-user case that both the restriction and its escape hatch.

|  |  | `GIT\_NO\_LAZY\_FETCH`:: |
|  |  | When cloning or fetching from a partial repository (i.e., one |
|  |  | itself cloned with `--filter`), the server-side `upload-pack` |
|  |  | may need to fetch extra objects from its upstream in order to |
|  |  | complete the request. By default, `upload-pack` will refuse to |
|  |  | perform such a lazy fetch, because `git fetch` may run arbitrary |
|  |  | commands specified in configuration and hooks of the source |
|  |  | repository (and `upload-pack` tries to be safe to run even in |
|  |  | untrusted `.git` directories). |
|  |  | + |
|  |  | This is implemented by having `upload-pack` internally set the |
|  |  | `GIT\_NO\_LAZY\_FETCH` variable to `1`. If you want to override it |
|  |  | (because you are fetching from a partial clone, and you are sure |
|  |  | you trust it), you can explicitly set `GIT\_NO\_LAZY\_FETCH` to |
|  |  | `0`. |
