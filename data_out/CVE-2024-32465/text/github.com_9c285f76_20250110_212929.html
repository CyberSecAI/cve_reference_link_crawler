# Protections for cloning untrusted repositories can be bypassed

High

[dscho](/dscho)
published
GHSA-vm9j-46j9-qvq4
May 14, 2024

## Package

git

## Affected versions

v2.45.0 v2.44.0 <=v2.43.3 <=v2.42.1 v2.41.0 <=v2.40.1 <=v2.39.3

## Patched versions

v2.45.1 v2.44.1 v2.43.4 v2.42.2 v2.41.1 v2.40.2 v2.39.4

## Description

### Impact

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone them first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed.

In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004.

But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024.

### Workarounds

Avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
