- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort in FortiSandbox. This makes it easier to crack passwords if the password database is compromised.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper password storage mechanism [CWE-916]
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the password database can efficiently mount bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system, potentially allowing for execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need access to the password database of the affected FortiSandbox.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the password database is required, which implies that the attacker needs to be positioned to access the system or the files where the password database is stored.
