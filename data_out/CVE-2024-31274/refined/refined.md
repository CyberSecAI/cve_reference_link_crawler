- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the EmbedPress plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The plugin lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could potentially execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. Specific impact is case-by-case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users who can access the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user, implying they do not need any specific privileges or a prior account on the WordPress site.
