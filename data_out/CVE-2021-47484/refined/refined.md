The provided content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a potential null pointer dereference in the `rvu_debugfs.c` and `rvu_nix.c` files within the Marvell OcteonTX2 Ethernet driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The code in `rvu_debugfs.c` and `rvu_nix.c` does not properly check for a null pointer before dereferencing it. This can lead to a crash if the pointer is null.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the `rvu_dbg_qsize_write` function in `rvu_debugfs.c` is called with a specific command, or when `nix_free_tx_vtag_entries` is called in `rvu_nix.c`
- Specifically, in `rvu_debugfs.c` a malformed subtoken or negative return value could trigger the issue if the checks are not ordered correctly.
- In `rvu_nix.c` if `get_nix_hw()` returns a NULL `nix_hw` pointer, it will be dereferenced, leading to a crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the debugfs interface and trigger the vulnerable code paths or somehow cause `get_nix_hw()` to return a null value. This might require some privileges depending on the debugfs interface permissions or specific system state that can result in `get_nix_hw()` returning NULL.
