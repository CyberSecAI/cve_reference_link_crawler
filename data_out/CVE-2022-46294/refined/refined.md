{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the translationVectors parsing functionality in the MOPAC Cartesian file format of Open Babel. Specifically, the `numTranslationVectors` index can be incremented beyond the bounds of the `translationVectors` array on the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). The code does not validate the size of the array before writing to it leading to an out-of-bounds write on the stack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. The out-of-bounds write on the stack can overwrite other data on the stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially-crafted malformed MOPAC Cartesian file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can provide a malicious MOPAC Cartesian file to trigger this vulnerability. The attacker would likely need to have the ability to get the vulnerable software to parse the malicious file."
