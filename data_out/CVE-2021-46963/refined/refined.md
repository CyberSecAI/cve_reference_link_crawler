Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-46963.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect call to free a Service Request Block (SRB) in the `qla2xxx_mqueuecommand()` function of the `qla2xxx` SCSI driver. The SRB is now allocated by upper layers of the kernel, but the driver was still attempting to free it, leading to a double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The driver was attempting to free an SRB that had already been freed by the upper layers. This double free vulnerability exists within the `qla2xxx_mqueuecommand` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The double free leads to a crash due to memory corruption, specifically within `kmem_cache_free`, causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the normal operation of the `qla2xxx` driver, specifically by queuing SCSI commands which fail with `QLA_INTERFACE_ERROR`.
- Any user or process that can initiate SCSI commands using the `qla2xxx` driver can potentially trigger the vulnerability, assuming the condition where `rval` equals `QLA_INTERFACE_ERROR` is met.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send SCSI commands using the `qla2xxx` driver. This would typically require local access with permissions to interact with the storage subsystem.

**Additional Information:**

The fix removes the lines of code that attempt to free the SRB, preventing the double free, while ensuring that the SRB is managed by upper layers of the kernel:

The fix ensures that the SRB is not freed in the `qla2xxx_mqueuecommand` function when `rval` is not `QLA_SUCCESS`, specifically removing the `qc24_free_sp_fail_command` label and associated code.

This patch was backported to various stable kernel versions, as indicated by the different commits provided, demonstrating a wide range of affected versions.
