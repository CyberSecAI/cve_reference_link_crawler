- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin exposes sensitive actions (e.g., "tp_reset", "tp_cleanup") under the Utilities tab, which can be executed by the lowest-privileged users (Subscriber+).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization, broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can reset configurations and perform backup/restore operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending requests to specific admin-ajax.php endpoints with vulnerable actions (e.g., `admin-ajax.php?action=tp_reset`, `admin-ajax.php?action=tp_cleanup&days=0`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with a Subscriber role or higher is required. The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
