# Request processing race condition in HTTP pipelining with invalid first request

Critical

[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)
published
GHSA-9298-4cf8-g4wj
Oct 29, 2024

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=2.0.0,<3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

A remote client may send a request that is exactly `recv_bytes` (defaults to 8192) long, followed by a secondary request using HTTP pipelining.

When request lookahead is disabled (default) we won't read any more requests, and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, we simply close the connection.

However when request lookahead is enabled, it is possible to process and receive the first request, start sending the error message back to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This will allow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while the connection should be closed.

### Patches

Waitress 3.0.1 fixes the race condition.

### Workarounds

Disable `channel_request_lookahead`, this is set to `0` by default disabling this feature. For this vulnerability this value is required to be changed from the default.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues> (if not sensitive or security related)
* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)

### Thanks

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
