* x64: Fix an off-by-one in in `i64x2.shr_s`

This commit fixes a mistake from [#6372](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6372) where one of the immediates to a
`pshufd` instruction was off-by-one in terms of bits. This fixes the
behavior of the wasm `i64x2.shr_s` instruction with constant shift
amounts larger than 32.

* Update release notes

```
pub struct Config { /* private fields */ }
```
Expand description

Global configuration options used to create an [`Engine`](struct.Engine.html "struct wasmtime::Engine")
and customize its behavior.

This structure exposed a builder-like interface and is primarily consumed by
[`Engine::new()`](struct.Engine.html#method.new "associated function wasmtime::Engine::new").

The validation of `Config` is deferred until the engine is being built, thus
a problematic config may cause `Engine::new` to fail.

## [§](#defaults)Defaults

The `Default` trait implementation and the return value from
[`Config::new()`](struct.Config.html#method.new "associated function wasmtime::Config::new") are the same and represent the default set of
configuration for an engine. The exact set of defaults will differ based on
properties such as enabled Cargo features at compile time and the configured
target (see [`Config::target`](struct.Config.html#method.target "method wasmtime::Config::target")). Configuration options document their
default values and what the conditional value of the default is where
applicable.

## Implementations[§](#implementations)

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#221-2486)[§](#impl-Config)
### impl [Config](struct.Config.html "struct wasmtime::Config")

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#224-277)
#### pub fn [new](#method.new)() -> Self

Creates a new configuration object with the default configuration
specified.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#303-308)
#### pub fn [target](#method.target)(&mut self, target: &[str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html)) -> [Result](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.94/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/anyhow/type.Result.html "type anyhow::Result")<&mut Self>

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures the target platform of this [`Config`](struct.Config.html "struct wasmtime::Config").

This method is used to configure the output of compilation in an
[`Engine`](struct.Engine.html "struct wasmtime::Engine"). This can be used, for example, to
cross-compile from one platform to another. By default, the host target
triple is used meaning compiled code is suitable to run on the host.

Note that the [`Module`](struct.Module.html "struct wasmtime::Module") type can only be created if the
target configured here matches the host. Otherwise if a cross-compile is
being performed where the host doesn’t match the target then
[`Engine::precompile_module`](struct.Engine.html#method.precompile_module "method wasmtime::Engine::precompile_module") must be
used instead.

Target-specific flags (such as CPU features) will not be inferred by
default for the target when one is provided here. This means that this
can also be used, for example, with the host architecture to disable all
host-inferred feature flags. Configuring target-specific flags can be
done with [`Config::cranelift_flag_set`](struct.Config.html#method.cranelift_flag_set "method wasmtime::Config::cranelift_flag_set") and
[`Config::cranelift_flag_enable`](struct.Config.html#method.cranelift_flag_enable "method wasmtime::Config::cranelift_flag_enable").

##### [§](#errors)Errors

This method will error if the given target triple is not supported.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#313-319)
#### pub fn [enable\_incremental\_compilation](#method.enable_incremental_compilation)( &mut self, cache\_store: [Arc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html "struct alloc::sync::Arc")<dyn [CacheStore](trait.CacheStore.html "trait wasmtime::CacheStore")>, ) -> [Result](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.94/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/anyhow/type.Result.html "type anyhow::Result")<&mut Self>

Available on **crate features `incremental-cache` and `cranelift`** only.

Enables the incremental compilation cache in Cranelift, using the provided `CacheStore`
backend for storage.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#413-416)
#### pub fn [async\_support](#method.async_support)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `async`** only.

Whether or not to enable support for asynchronous functions in Wasmtime.

When enabled, the config can optionally define host functions with `async`.
Instances created and functions called with this `Config` *must* be called
through their asynchronous APIs, however. For example using
[`Func::call`](struct.Func.html#method.call "method wasmtime::Func::call") will panic when used with this config.

##### [§](#asynchronous-wasm)Asynchronous Wasm

WebAssembly does not currently have a way to specify at the bytecode
level what is and isn’t async. Host-defined functions, however, may be
defined as `async`. WebAssembly imports always appear synchronous, which
gives rise to a bit of an impedance mismatch here. To solve this
Wasmtime supports “asynchronous configs” which enables calling these
asynchronous functions in a way that looks synchronous to the executing
WebAssembly code.

An asynchronous config must always invoke wasm code asynchronously,
meaning we’ll always represent its computation as a
[`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/future/future/trait.Future.html "trait core::future::future::Future"). The `poll` method of the futures
returned by Wasmtime will perform the actual work of calling the
WebAssembly. Wasmtime won’t manage its own thread pools or similar,
that’s left up to the embedder.

To implement futures in a way that WebAssembly sees asynchronous host
functions as synchronous, all async Wasmtime futures will execute on a
separately allocated native stack from the thread otherwise executing
Wasmtime. This separate native stack can then be switched to and from.
Using this whenever an `async` host function returns a future that
resolves to `Pending` we switch away from the temporary stack back to
the main stack and propagate the `Pending` status.

In general it’s encouraged that the integration with `async` and
wasmtime is designed early on in your embedding of Wasmtime to ensure
that it’s planned that WebAssembly executes in the right context of your
application.

##### [§](#execution-in-poll)Execution in `poll`

The [`Future::poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/future/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "method core::future::future::Future::poll") method is the main
driving force behind Rust’s futures. That method’s own documentation
states “an implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and
should not block”. This, however, can be at odds with executing
WebAssembly code as part of the `poll` method itself. If your
WebAssembly is untrusted then this could allow the `poll` method to take
arbitrarily long in the worst case, likely blocking all other
asynchronous tasks.

To remedy this situation you have a a few possible ways to solve this:

* The most efficient solution is to enable
  [`Config::epoch_interruption`](struct.Config.html#method.epoch_interruption "method wasmtime::Config::epoch_interruption") in conjunction with
  [`crate::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`](struct.Store.html#method.epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update "method wasmtime::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update"). Coupled with
  periodic calls to [`crate::Engine::increment_epoch`](struct.Engine.html#method.increment_epoch "method wasmtime::Engine::increment_epoch") this will cause
  executing WebAssembly to periodically yield back according to the
  epoch configuration settings. This enables `Future::poll` to take at
  most a certain amount of time according to epoch configuration
  settings and when increments happen. The benefit of this approach is
  that the instrumentation in compiled code is quite lightweight, but a
  downside can be that the scheduling is somewhat nondeterministic since
  increments are usually timer-based which are not always deterministic.

  Note that to prevent infinite execution of wasm it’s recommended to
  place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code
  and the periodic yields with epochs should ensure that when the
  timeout is reached it’s appropriately recognized.
* Alternatively you can enable the
  [`Config::consume_fuel`](struct.Config.html#method.consume_fuel "method wasmtime::Config::consume_fuel") method as well
  as [`crate::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval`](struct.Store.html#method.fuel_async_yield_interval "method wasmtime::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval") When doing so this will
  configure Wasmtime futures to yield periodically while they’re
  executing WebAssembly code. After consuming the specified amount of
  fuel wasm futures will return `Poll::Pending` from their `poll`
  method, and will get automatically re-polled later. This enables the
  `Future::poll` method to take roughly a fixed amount of time since
  fuel is guaranteed to get consumed while wasm is executing. Unlike
  epoch-based preemption this is deterministic since wasm always
  consumes a fixed amount of fuel per-operation. The downside of this
  approach, however, is that the compiled code instrumentation is
  significantly more expensive than epoch checks.

  Note that to prevent infinite execution of wasm it’s recommended to
  place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code
  and the periodic yields with epochs should ensure that when the
  timeout is reached it’s appropriately recognized.

In all cases special care needs to be taken when integrating
asynchronous wasm into your application. You should carefully plan where
WebAssembly will execute and what compute resources will be allotted to
it. If Wasmtime doesn’t support exactly what you’d like just yet, please
feel free to open an issue!

#### pub fn [debug\_info](#method.debug_info)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether DWARF debug information will be emitted during
compilation.

Note that the `debug-builtins` compile-time Cargo feature must also be
enabled for native debuggers such as GDB or LLDB to be able to debug
guest WebAssembly programs.

By default this option is `false`.
**Note** Enabling this option is not compatible with the Winch compiler.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#456-459)
#### pub fn [wasm\_backtrace](#method.wasm_backtrace)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether [`WasmBacktrace`](struct.WasmBacktrace.html "struct wasmtime::WasmBacktrace") will be present in the context of
errors returned from Wasmtime.

A backtrace may be collected whenever an error is returned from a host
function call through to WebAssembly or when WebAssembly itself hits a
trap condition, such as an out-of-bounds memory access. This flag
indicates, in these conditions, whether the backtrace is collected or
not.

Currently wasm backtraces are implemented through frame pointer walking.
This means that collecting a backtrace is expected to be a fast and
relatively cheap operation. Additionally backtrace collection is
suitable in concurrent environments since one thread capturing a
backtrace won’t block other threads.

Collected backtraces are attached via [`anyhow::Error::context`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.94/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/anyhow/struct.Error.html#method.context "method anyhow::Error::context") to
errors returned from host functions. The [`WasmBacktrace`](struct.WasmBacktrace.html "struct wasmtime::WasmBacktrace") type can be
acquired via [`anyhow::Error::downcast_ref`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.94/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/anyhow/struct.Error.html#method.downcast_ref "method anyhow::Error::downcast_ref") to inspect the backtrace.
When this option is disabled then this context is never applied to
errors coming out of wasm.

This option is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#474-494)
#### pub fn [wasm\_backtrace\_details](#method.wasm_backtrace_details)( &mut self, enable: [WasmBacktraceDetails](enum.WasmBacktraceDetails.html "enum wasmtime::WasmBacktraceDetails"), ) -> &mut Self

Configures whether backtraces in `Trap` will parse debug info in the wasm file to
have filename/line number information.

When enabled this will causes modules to retain debugging information
found in wasm binaries. This debug information will be used when a trap
happens to symbolicate each stack frame and attempt to print a
filename/line number for each wasm frame in the stack trace.

By default this option is `WasmBacktraceDetails::Environment`, meaning
that wasm will read `WASMTIME_BACKTRACE_DETAILS` to indicate whether
details should be parsed. Note that the `std` feature of this crate must
be active to read environment variables, otherwise this is disabled by
default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#511-514)
#### pub fn [native\_unwind\_info](#method.native_unwind_info)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether to generate native unwind information
(e.g. `.eh_frame` on Linux).

This configuration option only exists to help third-party stack
capturing mechanisms, such as the system’s unwinder or the `backtrace`
crate, determine how to unwind through Wasm frames. It does not affect
whether Wasmtime can capture Wasm backtraces or not. The presence of
[`WasmBacktrace`](struct.WasmBacktrace.html "struct wasmtime::WasmBacktrace") is controlled by the [`Config::wasm_backtrace`](struct.Config.html#method.wasm_backtrace "method wasmtime::Config::wasm_backtrace")
option.

Native unwind information is included:

* When targeting Windows, since the Windows ABI requires it.
* By default.
[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#534-537)
#### pub fn [consume\_fuel](#method.consume_fuel)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether execution of WebAssembly will “consume fuel” to
either halt or yield execution as desired.

This can be used to deterministically prevent infinitely-executing
WebAssembly code by instrumenting generated code to consume fuel as it
executes. When fuel runs out a trap is raised, however [`Store`](struct.Store.html "struct wasmtime::Store") can be
configured to yield execution periodically via
[`crate::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval`](struct.Store.html#method.fuel_async_yield_interval "method wasmtime::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval").

Note that a [`Store`](struct.Store.html "struct wasmtime::Store") starts with no fuel, so if you enable this option
you’ll have to be sure to pour some fuel into [`Store`](struct.Store.html "struct wasmtime::Store") before
executing some code.

By default this option is `false`.

**Note** Enabling this option is not compatible with the Winch compiler.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#648-651)
#### pub fn [epoch\_interruption](#method.epoch_interruption)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Enables epoch-based interruption.

When executing code in async mode, we sometimes want to
implement a form of cooperative timeslicing: long-running Wasm
guest code should periodically yield to the executor
loop. This yielding could be implemented by using “fuel” (see
[`consume_fuel`](struct.Config.html#method.consume_fuel "method wasmtime::Config::consume_fuel")). However, fuel
instrumentation is somewhat expensive: it modifies the
compiled form of the Wasm code so that it maintains a precise
instruction count, frequently checking this count against the
remaining fuel. If one does not need this precise count or
deterministic interruptions, and only needs a periodic
interrupt of some form, then It would be better to have a more
lightweight mechanism.

Epoch-based interruption is that mechanism. There is a global
“epoch”, which is a counter that divides time into arbitrary
periods (or epochs). This counter lives on the
[`Engine`](struct.Engine.html "struct wasmtime::Engine") and can be incremented by calling
[`Engine::increment_epoch`](struct.Engine.html#method.increment_epoch "method wasmtime::Engine::increment_epoch").
Epoch-based instrumentation works by setting a “deadline
epoch”. The compiled code knows the deadline, and at certain
points, checks the current epoch against that deadline. It
will yield if the deadline has been reached.

The idea is that checking an infrequently-changing counter is
cheaper than counting and frequently storing a precise metric
(instructions executed) locally. The interruptions are not
deterministic, but if the embedder increments the epoch in a
periodic way (say, every regular timer tick by a thread or
signal handler), then we can ensure that all async code will
yield to the executor within a bounded time.

The deadline check cannot be avoided by malicious wasm code. It is safe
to use epoch deadlines to limit the execution time of untrusted
code.

The [`Store`](struct.Store.html "struct wasmtime::Store") tracks the deadline, and controls
what happens when the deadline is reached during
execution. Several behaviors are possible:

* Trap if code is executing when the epoch deadline is
  met. See
  [`Store::epoch_deadline_trap`](struct.Store.html#method.epoch_deadline_trap "method wasmtime::Store::epoch_deadline_trap").
* Call an arbitrary function. This function may chose to trap or
  increment the epoch. See
  [`Store::epoch_deadline_callback`](struct.Store.html#method.epoch_deadline_callback "method wasmtime::Store::epoch_deadline_callback").
* Yield to the executor loop, then resume when the future is
  next polled. See
  [`Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`](struct.Store.html#method.epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update "method wasmtime::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update").

Trapping is the default. The yielding behaviour may be used for
the timeslicing behavior described above.

This feature is available with or without async support.
However, without async support, the timeslicing behaviour is
not available. This means epoch-based interruption can only
serve as a simple external-interruption mechanism.

An initial deadline must be set before executing code by calling
[`Store::set_epoch_deadline`](struct.Store.html#method.set_epoch_deadline "method wasmtime::Store::set_epoch_deadline"). If this
deadline is not configured then wasm will immediately trap.

###### [§](#interaction-with-blocking-host-calls)Interaction with blocking host calls

Epochs (and fuel) do not assist in handling WebAssembly code blocked in
a call to the host. For example if the WebAssembly function calls
`wasi:io/poll/poll` to sleep epochs will not assist in waking this up or
timing it out. Epochs intentionally only affect running WebAssembly code
itself and it’s left to the embedder to determine how best to wake up
indefinitely blocking code in the host.

The typical solution for this, however, is to use
[`Config::async_support(true)`](struct.Config.html#method.async_support "method wasmtime::Config::async_support") and the `async`
variant of WASI host functions. This models computation as a Rust
`Future` which means that when blocking happens the future is only
suspended and control yields back to the main event loop. This gives the
embedder the opportunity to use `tokio::time::timeout` for example on a
wasm computation and have the desired effect of cancelling a blocking
operation when a timeout expires.

###### [§](#when-to-use-fuel-vs-epochs)When to use fuel vs. epochs

In general, epoch-based interruption results in faster
execution. This difference is sometimes significant: in some
measurements, up to 2-3x. This is because epoch-based
interruption does less work: it only watches for a global
rarely-changing counter to increment, rather than keeping a
local frequently-changing counter and comparing it to a
deadline.

Fuel, in contrast, should be used when *deterministic*
yielding or trapping is needed. For example, if it is required
that the same function call with the same starting state will
always either complete or trap with an out-of-fuel error,
deterministically, then fuel with a fixed bound should be
used.

**Note** Enabling this option is not compatible with the Winch compiler.

#### pub fn [max\_wasm\_stack](#method.max_wasm_stack)(&mut self, size: [usize](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.usize.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures the maximum amount of stack space available for
executing WebAssembly code.

WebAssembly has well-defined semantics on stack overflow. This is
intended to be a knob which can help configure how much stack space
wasm execution is allowed to consume. Note that the number here is not
super-precise, but rather wasm will take at most “pretty close to this
much” stack space.

If a wasm call (or series of nested wasm calls) take more stack space
than the `size` specified then a stack overflow trap will be raised.

Caveat: this knob only limits the stack space consumed by wasm code.
More importantly, it does not ensure that this much stack space is
available on the calling thread stack. Exhausting the thread stack
typically leads to an **abort** of the process.

Here are some examples of how that could happen:

* Let’s assume this option is set to 2 MiB and then a thread that has
  a stack with 512 KiB left.

  If wasm code consumes more than 512 KiB then the process will be aborted.
* Assuming the same conditions, but this time wasm code does not consume
  any stack but calls into a host function. The host function consumes
  more than 512 KiB of stack space. The process will be aborted.

There’s another gotcha related to recursive calling into wasm: the stack
space consumed by a host function is counted towards this limit. The
host functions are not prevented from consuming more than this limit.
However, if the host function that used more than this limit and called
back into wasm, then the execution will trap immediately because of
stack overflow.

When the `async` feature is enabled, this value cannot exceed the
`async_stack_size` option. Be careful not to set this value too close
to `async_stack_size` as doing so may limit how much stack space
is available for host functions.

By default this option is 512 KiB.

##### [§](#errors-1)Errors

The `Engine::new` method will fail if the `size` specified here is
either 0 or larger than the [`Config::async_stack_size`](struct.Config.html#method.async_stack_size "method wasmtime::Config::async_stack_size") configuration.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#721-724)
#### pub fn [async\_stack\_size](#method.async_stack_size)(&mut self, size: [usize](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.usize.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `async`** only.

Configures the size of the stacks used for asynchronous execution.

This setting configures the size of the stacks that are allocated for
asynchronous execution. The value cannot be less than `max_wasm_stack`.

The amount of stack space guaranteed for host functions is
`async_stack_size - max_wasm_stack`, so take care not to set these two values
close to one another; doing so may cause host functions to overflow the
stack and abort the process.

By default this option is 2 MiB.

##### [§](#errors-2)Errors

The `Engine::new` method will fail if the value for this option is
smaller than the [`Config::max_wasm_stack`](struct.Config.html#method.max_wasm_stack "method wasmtime::Config::max_wasm_stack") option.

#### pub fn [wasm\_tail\_call](#method.wasm_tail_call)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly tail calls proposal will be enabled
for compilation or not.

The [WebAssembly tail calls proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tail-call) introduces the `return_call` and
`return_call_indirect` instructions. These instructions allow for Wasm
programs to implement some recursive algorithms with *O(1)* stack space
usage.

This is `true` by default except when the Winch compiler is enabled.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#768-771)
#### pub fn [wasm\_custom\_page\_sizes](#method.wasm_custom_page_sizes)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly custom-page-sizes proposal will be
enabled for compilation or not.

The [WebAssembly custom-page-sizes proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-page-sizes) allows a memory to
customize its page sizes. By default, Wasm page sizes are 64KiB
large. This proposal allows the memory to opt into smaller page sizes
instead, allowing Wasm to run in environments with less than 64KiB RAM
available, for example.

Note that the page size is part of the memory’s type, and because
different memories may have different types, they may also have
different page sizes.

Currently the only valid page sizes are 64KiB (the default) and 1
byte. Future extensions may relax this constraint and allow all powers
of two.

Support for this proposal is disabled by default.

#### pub fn [wasm\_threads](#method.wasm_threads)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `threads`** only.

Configures whether the WebAssembly [threads](https://github.com/webassembly/threads) proposal will be enabled
for compilation.

This feature gates items such as shared memories and atomic
instructions. Note that the threads feature depends on the bulk memory
feature, which is enabled by default. Additionally note that while the
wasm feature is called “threads” it does not actually include the
ability to spawn threads. Spawning threads is part of the [wasi-threads](https://github.com/webassembly/wasi-threads)
proposal which is a separately gated feature in Wasmtime.

Embeddings of Wasmtime are able to build their own custom threading
scheme on top of the core wasm threads proposal, however.

The default value for this option is whether the `threads`
crate feature of Wasmtime is enabled or not. By default this crate
feature is enabled.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#815-818)
#### pub fn [wasm\_reference\_types](#method.wasm_reference_types)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `gc`** only.

Configures whether the [WebAssembly reference types proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/reference-types)
will be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates items such as the `externref` and `funcref` types as
well as allowing a module to define multiple tables.

Note that the reference types proposal depends on the bulk memory proposal.

This feature is `true` by default.

##### [§](#errors-3)Errors

The validation of this feature are deferred until the engine is being built,
and thus may cause `Engine::new` fail if the `bulk_memory` feature is disabled.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#834-837)
#### pub fn [wasm\_function\_references](#method.wasm_function_references)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `gc`** only.

Configures whether the [WebAssembly function references
proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references) will be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates non-nullable reference types, function reference
types, `call_ref`, `ref.func`, and non-nullable reference related
instructions.

Note that the function references proposal depends on the reference
types proposal.

This feature is `false` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#845-848)
#### pub fn [wasm\_wide\_arithmetic](#method.wasm_wide_arithmetic)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the [WebAssembly wide-arithmetic](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wide-arithmetic) will be
enabled for compilation.

This feature is `false` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#866-869)
#### pub fn [wasm\_gc](#method.wasm_gc)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `gc`** only.

Configures whether the [WebAssembly Garbage Collection
proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) will be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates `struct` and `array` type definitions and references,
the `i31ref` type, and all related instructions.

Note that the function references proposal depends on the typed function
references proposal.

This feature is `false` by default.

**Warning: Wasmtime’s implementation of the GC proposal is still in
progress and generally not ready for primetime.**

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#886-889)
#### pub fn [wasm\_simd](#method.wasm_simd)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly SIMD proposal will be
enabled for compilation.

The [WebAssembly SIMD proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/simd). This feature gates items such
as the `v128` type and all of its operators being in a module. Note that
this does not enable the [relaxed simd proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd).

On x86\_64 platforms note that enabling this feature requires SSE 4.2 and
below to be available on the target platform. Compilation will fail if
the compile target does not include SSE 4.2.

This is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#913-916)
#### pub fn [wasm\_relaxed\_simd](#method.wasm_relaxed_simd)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly Relaxed SIMD proposal will be
enabled for compilation.

The relaxed SIMD proposal adds new instructions to WebAssembly which,
for some specific inputs, are allowed to produce different results on
different hosts. More-or-less this proposal enables exposing
platform-specific semantics of SIMD instructions in a controlled
fashion to a WebAssembly program. From an embedder’s perspective this
means that WebAssembly programs may execute differently depending on
whether the host is x86\_64 or AArch64, for example.

By default Wasmtime lowers relaxed SIMD instructions to the fastest
lowering for the platform it’s running on. This means that, by default,
some relaxed SIMD instructions may have different results for the same
inputs across x86\_64 and AArch64. This behavior can be disabled through
the [`Config::relaxed_simd_deterministic`](struct.Config.html#method.relaxed_simd_deterministic "method wasmtime::Config::relaxed_simd_deterministic") option which will force
deterministic behavior across all platforms, as classified by the
specification, at the cost of performance.

This is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#934-937)
#### pub fn [relaxed\_simd\_deterministic](#method.relaxed_simd_deterministic)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

This option can be used to control the behavior of the [relaxed SIMD
proposal’s](https://github.com/webassembly/relaxed-simd) instructions.

The relaxed SIMD proposal introduces instructions that are allowed to
have different behavior on different architectures, primarily to afford
an efficient implementation on all architectures. This means, however,
that the same module may execute differently on one host than another,
which typically is not otherwise the case. This option is provided to
force Wasmtime to generate deterministic code for all relaxed simd
instructions, at the cost of performance, for all architectures. When
this option is enabled then the deterministic behavior of all
instructions in the relaxed SIMD proposal is selected.

This is `false` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#957-960)
#### pub fn [wasm\_bulk\_memory](#method.wasm_bulk_memory)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the [WebAssembly bulk memory operations
proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/bulk-memory-operations) will be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates items such as the `memory.copy` instruction, passive
data/table segments, etc, being in a module.

This is `true` by default.

Feature `reference_types`, which is also `true` by default, requires
this feature to be enabled. Thus disabling this feature must also disable
`reference_types` as well using [`wasm_reference_types`](struct.Config.html#method.wasm_reference_types "method wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types").

##### [§](#errors-4)Errors

Disabling this feature without disabling `reference_types` will cause
`Engine::new` to fail.

#### pub fn [wasm\_multi\_value](#method.wasm_multi_value)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly multi-value [proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/multi-value) will
be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates functions and blocks returning multiple values in a
module, for example.

This is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#985-988)
#### pub fn [wasm\_multi\_memory](#method.wasm_multi_memory)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly multi-memory [proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/multi-memory) will
be enabled for compilation.

This feature gates modules having more than one linear memory
declaration or import.

This is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1000-1003)
#### pub fn [wasm\_memory64](#method.wasm_memory64)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly memory64 [proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/memory64) will
be enabled for compilation.

Note that this the upstream specification is not finalized and Wasmtime
may also have bugs for this feature since it hasn’t been exercised
much.

This is `false` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1011-1014)
#### pub fn [wasm\_extended\_const](#method.wasm_extended_const)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether the WebAssembly extended-const [proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/extended-const) will
be enabled for compilation.

This is `true` by default.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1030-1033)
#### pub fn [wasm\_component\_model](#method.wasm_component_model)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `component-model`** only.

Configures whether the WebAssembly component-model [proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/component-model) will
be enabled for compilation.

This flag can be used to blanket disable all components within Wasmtime.
Otherwise usage of components requires statically using
[`Component`](component/struct.Component.html "struct wasmtime::component::Component") instead of
[`Module`](struct.Module.html "struct wasmtime::Module") for example anyway.

The default value for this option is whether the `component-model`
crate feature of Wasmtime is enabled or not. By default this crate
feature is enabled.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1041-1044)
#### pub fn [wasm\_component\_model\_more\_flags](#method.wasm_component_model_more_flags)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `component-model`** only.

Configures whether components support more than 32 flags in each `flags`
type.

#### pub fn [strategy](#method.strategy)(&mut self, strategy: [Strategy](enum.Strategy.html "enum wasmtime::Strategy")) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures which compilation strategy will be used for wasm modules.

This method can be used to configure which compiler is used for wasm
modules, and for more documentation consult the [`Strategy`](enum.Strategy.html "enum wasmtime::Strategy") enumeration
and its documentation.

The default value for this is `Strategy::Auto`.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1077-1080)
#### pub fn [collector](#method.collector)(&mut self, collector: [Collector](enum.Collector.html "enum wasmtime::Collector")) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `gc`** only.

Configures which garbage collector will be used for Wasm modules.

This method can be used to configure which garbage collector
implementation is used for Wasm modules. For more documentation, consult
the [`Collector`](enum.Collector.html "enum wasmtime::Collector") enumeration and its documentation.

The default value for this is `Collector::Auto`.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1096-1099)
#### pub fn [profiler](#method.profiler)(&mut self, profile: [ProfilingStrategy](enum.ProfilingStrategy.html "enum wasmtime::ProfilingStrategy")) -> &mut Self

Creates a default profiler based on the profiling strategy chosen.

Profiler creation calls the type’s default initializer where the purpose is
really just to put in place the type used for profiling.

Some [`ProfilingStrategy`](enum.ProfilingStrategy.html "enum wasmtime::ProfilingStrategy") require specific platforms or particular feature
to be enabled, such as `ProfilingStrategy::JitDump` requires the `jitdump`
feature.

##### [§](#errors-5)Errors

The validation of this field is deferred until the engine is being built, and thus may
cause `Engine::new` fail if the required feature is disabled, or the platform is not
supported.

#### pub fn [cranelift\_debug\_verifier](#method.cranelift_debug_verifier)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures whether the debug verifier of Cranelift is enabled or not.

When Cranelift is used as a code generation backend this will configure
it to have the `enable_verifier` flag which will enable a number of debug
checks inside of Cranelift. This is largely only useful for the
developers of wasmtime itself.

The default value for this is `false`

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1126-1136)
#### pub fn [cranelift\_opt\_level](#method.cranelift_opt_level)(&mut self, level: [OptLevel](enum.OptLevel.html "enum wasmtime::OptLevel")) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures the Cranelift code generator optimization level.

When the Cranelift code generator is used you can configure the
optimization level used for generated code in a few various ways. For
more information see the documentation of [`OptLevel`](enum.OptLevel.html "enum wasmtime::OptLevel").

The default value for this is `OptLevel::None`.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1148-1157)
#### pub fn [cranelift\_regalloc\_algorithm](#method.cranelift_regalloc_algorithm)( &mut self, algo: [RegallocAlgorithm](enum.RegallocAlgorithm.html "enum wasmtime::RegallocAlgorithm"), ) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures the regalloc algorithm used by the Cranelift code generator.

Cranelift can select any of several register allocator algorithms. Each
of these algorithms generates correct code, but they represent different
tradeoffs between compile speed (how expensive the compilation process
is) and run-time speed (how fast the generated code runs).
For more information see the documentation of [`RegallocAlgorithm`](enum.RegallocAlgorithm.html "enum wasmtime::RegallocAlgorithm").

The default value for this is `RegallocAlgorithm::Backtracking`.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1173-1179)
#### pub fn [cranelift\_nan\_canonicalization](#method.cranelift_nan_canonicalization)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Configures whether Cranelift should perform a NaN-canonicalization pass.

When Cranelift is used as a code generation backend this will configure
it to replace NaNs with a single canonical value. This is useful for
users requiring entirely deterministic WebAssembly computation. This is
not required by the WebAssembly spec, so it is not enabled by default.

Note that this option affects not only WebAssembly’s `f32` and `f64`
types but additionally the `v128` type. This option will cause
operations using any of these types to have extra checks placed after
them to normalize NaN values as needed.

The default value for this is `false`

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1195-1201)
#### pub fn [cranelift\_pcc](#method.cranelift_pcc)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Controls whether proof-carrying code (PCC) is used to validate
lowering of Wasm sandbox checks.

Proof-carrying code carries “facts” about program values from
the IR all the way to machine code, and checks those facts
against known machine-instruction semantics. This guards
against bugs in instruction lowering that might create holes
in the Wasm sandbox.

PCC is designed to be fast: it does not require complex
solvers or logic engines to verify, but only a linear pass
over a trail of “breadcrumbs” or facts at each intermediate
value. Thus, it is appropriate to enable in production.

#### pub unsafe fn [cranelift\_flag\_enable](#method.cranelift_flag_enable)(&mut self, flag: &[str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Allows setting a Cranelift boolean flag or preset. This allows
fine-tuning of Cranelift settings.

Since Cranelift flags may be unstable, this method should not be considered to be stable
either; other `Config` functions should be preferred for stability.

##### [§](#safety)Safety

This is marked as unsafe, because setting the wrong flag might break invariants,
resulting in execution hazards.

##### [§](#errors-6)Errors

The validation of the flags are deferred until the engine is being built, and thus may

Available on **crate features `cranelift` or `winch`** only.

Allows settings another Cranelift flag defined by a flag name and value. This allows
fine-tuning of Cranelift settings.

Since Cranelift flags may be unstable, this method should not be considered to be stable
either; other `Config` functions should be preferred for stability.

##### [§](#safety-1)Safety

This is marked as unsafe, because setting the wrong flag might break invariants,
resulting in execution hazards.

##### [§](#errors-7)Errors

The validation of the flags are deferred until the engine is being built, and thus may
cause `Engine::new` fail if the flag’s name does not exist, or incompatible with other
settings.

For example, feature `wasm_backtrace` will set `unwind_info` to `true`, but if it’s
manually set to false then it will fail.

Available on **crate feature `cache`** only.

Loads cache configuration specified at `path`.

This method will read the file specified by `path` on the filesystem and
attempt to load cache configuration from it. This method can also fail
due to I/O errors, misconfiguration, syntax errors, etc. For expected
syntax in the configuration file see the [documentation online](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/cli-cache.html).

By default cache configuration is not enabled or loaded.

This method is only available when the `cache` feature of this crate is

Available on **crate feature `cache`** only.

Disable caching.

Every call to [`Module::new(my_wasm)`](struct.Module.html#method.new "associated function wasmtime::Module::new") will
recompile `my_wasm`, even when it is unchanged.

By default, new configs do not have caching enabled. This method is only

Available on **crate feature `cache`** only.

Loads cache configuration from the system default path.

This commit is the same as [`Config::cache_config_load`](struct.Config.html#method.cache_config_load "method wasmtime::Config::cache_config_load") except that it
does not take a path argument and instead loads the default
configuration present on the system. This is located, for example, on
Unix at `$HOME/.config/wasmtime/config.toml` and is typically created
with the `wasmtime config new` command.

By default cache configuration is not enabled or loaded.

This method is only available when the `cache` feature of this crate is
enabled.

##### [§](#errors-9)Errors

This method can fail due to any error that happens when loading the
default system configuration. Note that it is not an error if the

This function will change the size of the initial memory allocation made
for linear memories. This setting is only applicable when the initial
size of a linear memory is below this threshold. Linear memories are
allocated in the virtual address space of the host process with OS APIs
such as `mmap` and this setting affects how large the allocation will
be.

###### [§](#background-webassembly-linear-memories)Background: WebAssembly Linear Memories

WebAssembly linear memories always start with a minimum size and can
possibly grow up to a maximum size. The minimum size is always specified
in a WebAssembly module itself and the maximum size can either be
optionally specified in the module or inherently limited by the index
type. For example for this module:

```
(module
    (memory $a 4)
    (memory $b 4096 4096 (pagesize 1))
    (memory $c i64 10)
)
```

* Memory `$a` initially allocates 4 WebAssembly pages (256KiB) and can
  grow up to 4GiB, the limit of the 32-bit index space.
* Memory `$b` initially allocates 4096 WebAssembly pages, but in this
  case its page size is 1, so it’s 4096 bytes. Memory can also grow no
  further meaning that it will always be 4096 bytes.
* Memory `$c` is a 64-bit linear memory which starts with 640KiB of
  memory and can theoretically grow up to 2^64 bytes, although most
  hosts will run out of memory long before that.

All operations on linear memories done by wasm are required to be
in-bounds. Any access beyond the end of a linear memory is considered a
trap.

###### [§](#what-this-setting-affects-virtual-memory)What this setting affects: Virtual Memory

This setting is used to configure the behavior of the size of the linear
memory allocation performed for each of these memories. For example the
initial linear memory allocation looks like this:

```
             memory_reservation
                   |
         ◄─────────┴────────────────►
┌───────┬─────────┬──────────────────┬───────┐
│ guard │ initial │ ... capacity ... │ guard │
└───────┴─────────┴──────────────────┴───────┘
 ◄──┬──►                              ◄──┬──►
    │                                    │
    │                             memory_guard_size
    │
    │
 memory_guard_size (if guard_before_linear_memory)
```

Memory in the `initial` range is accessible to the instance and can be
read/written by wasm code. Memory in the `guard` regions is never
accesible to wasm code and memory in `capacity` is initially
inaccessible but may become accesible through `memory.grow` instructions
for example.

This means that this setting is the size of the initial chunk of virtual
memory that a linear memory may grow into.

###### [§](#what-this-setting-affects-runtime-speed)What this setting affects: Runtime Speed

This is a performance-sensitive setting which is taken into account
during the compilation process of a WebAssembly module. For example if a
32-bit WebAssembly linear memory has a `memory_reservation` size of 4GiB
then bounds checks can be elided because `capacity` will be guaranteed
to be unmapped for all addressible bytes that wasm can access (modulo a
few details).

If `memory_reservation` was something smaller like 256KiB then that
would have a much smaller impact on virtual memory but the compile code
would then need to have explicit bounds checks to ensure that
loads/stores are in-bounds.

The goal of this setting is to enable skipping bounds checks in most
modules by default. Some situations which require explicit bounds checks
though are:

* When `memory_reservation` is smaller than the addressible size of the
  linear memory. For example if 64-bit linear memories always need
  bounds checks as they can address the entire virtual address spacce.
  For 32-bit linear memories a `memory_reservation` minimum size of 4GiB
  is required to elide bounds checks.
* When linear memories have a page size of 1 then bounds checks are
  required. In this situation virtual memory can’t be relied upon
  because that operates at the host page size granularity where wasm
  requires a per-byte level granularity.
* Configuration settings such as [`Config::signals_based_traps`](struct.Config.html#method.signals_based_traps "method wasmtime::Config::signals_based_traps") can be
  used to disable the use of signal handlers and virtual memory so
  explicit bounds checks are required.
* When [`Config::memory_guard_size`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_guard_size "method wasmtime::Config::memory_guard_size") is too small a bounds check may be
  required. For 32-bit wasm addresses are actually 33-bit effective
  addresses because loads/stores have a 32-bit static offset to add to
  the dynamic 32-bit address. If the static offset is larger than the
  size of the guard region then an explicit bounds check is required.

###### [§](#what-this-setting-affects-memory-growth-behavior)What this setting affects: Memory Growth Behavior

In addition to affecting bounds checks emitted in compiled code this
setting also affects how WebAssembly linear memories are grown. The
`memory.grow` instruction can be used to make a linear memory larger and
this is also affected by APIs such as
[`Memory::grow`](struct.Memory.html#method.grow "method wasmtime::Memory::grow").

In these situations when the amount being grown is small enough to fit
within the remaining capacity then the linear memory doesn’t have to be
moved at runtime. If the capacity runs out though then a new linear
memory allocation must be made and the contents of linear memory is
copied over.

For example here’s a situation where a copy happens:

* The `memory_reservation` setting is configured to 128KiB.
* A WebAssembly linear memory starts with a single 64KiB page.
* This memory can be grown by one page to contain the full 128KiB of
  memory.
* If grown by one more page, though, then a 192KiB allocation must be
  made and the previous 128KiB of contents are copied into the new
  allocation.

This growth behavior can have a significant performance impact if lots
of data needs to be copied on growth. Conversely if memory growth never
needs to happen because the capacity will always be large enough then
optimizations can be applied to cache the base pointer of linear memory.

When memory is grown then the
[`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation_for_growth "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation_for_growth") is used for the new
memory allocation to have memory to grow into.

When using the pooling allocator via [`PoolingAllocationConfig`](struct.PoolingAllocationConfig.html "struct wasmtime::PoolingAllocationConfig") then
memories are never allowed to move so requests for growth are instead
rejected with an error.

###### [§](#when-this-setting-is-not-used)When this setting is not used

This setting is ignored and unused when the initial size of linear
memory is larger than this threshold. For example if this setting is set
to 1MiB but a wasm module requires a 2MiB minimum allocation then this
setting is ignored. In this situation the minimum size of memory will be
allocated along with [`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation_for_growth "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation_for_growth")
after it to grow into.

That means that this value can be set to zero. That can be useful in
benchmarking to see the overhead of bounds checks for example.
Additionally it can be used to minimize the virtual memory allocated by
Wasmtime.

###### [§](#default-value)Default Value

The default value for this property depends on the host platform. For
64-bit platforms there’s lots of address space available, so the default
configured here is 4GiB. When coupled with the default size of
[`Config::memory_guard_size`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_guard_size "method wasmtime::Config::memory_guard_size") this means that 32-bit WebAssembly linear
memories with 64KiB page sizes will skip almost all bounds checks by
default.

For 32-bit platforms this value defaults to 10MiB. This means that
bounds checks will be required on 32-bit platforms.

#### pub fn [memory\_may\_move](#method.memory_may_move)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `signals-based-traps`** only.

Indicates whether linear memories may relocate their base pointer at
runtime.

WebAssembly linear memories either have a maximum size that’s explicitly
listed in the type of a memory or inherently limited by the index type
of the memory (e.g. 4GiB for 32-bit linear memories). Depending on how
the linear memory is allocated (see [`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation")) it
may be necessary to move the memory in the host’s virtual address space
during growth. This option controls whether this movement is allowed or
not.

An example of a linear memory needing to move is when
[`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation") is 0 then a linear memory will be
allocated as the minimum size of the memory plus
[`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation_for_growth "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation_for_growth"). When memory grows beyond the
reservation for growth then the memory needs to be relocated.

When this option is set to `false` then it can have a number of impacts
on how memories work at runtime:

* Modules can be compiled with static knowledge the base pointer of
  linear memory never changes to enable optimizations such as
  loop invariant code motion (hoisting the base pointer out of a loop).
* Memories cannot grow in excess of their original allocation. This
  means that [`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation") and
  [`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation_for_growth "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation_for_growth") may need tuning to ensure
  the memory configuration works at runtime.

The default value for this option is `true`.

#### pub fn [memory\_guard\_size](#method.memory_guard_size)(&mut self, bytes: [u64](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u64.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `signals-based-traps`** only.

Configures the size, in bytes, of the guard region used at the end of a
linear memory’s address space reservation.

> Note: this value has important performance ramifications, be sure to
> understand what this value does before tweaking it and benchmarking.

This setting controls how many bytes are guaranteed to be unmapped after
the virtual memory allocation of a linear memory. When
combined with sufficiently large values of
[`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation") (e.g. 4GiB for 32-bit linear memories)
then a guard region can be used to eliminate bounds checks in generated
code.

This setting additionally can be used to help deduplicate bounds checks
in code that otherwise requires bounds checks. For example with a 4KiB
guard region then a 64-bit linear memory which accesses addresses `x+8`
and `x+16` only needs to perform a single bounds check on `x`. If that
bounds check passes then the offset is guaranteed to either reside in
linear memory or the guard region, resulting in deterministic behavior
either way.

###### [§](#how-big-should-the-guard-be)How big should the guard be?

In general, like with configuring [`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation"), you
probably don’t want to change this value from the defaults. Removing
bounds checks is dependent on a number of factors where the size of the
guard region is only one piece of the equation. Other factors include:

* [`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation")
* The index type of the linear memory (e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit)
* The page size of the linear memory
* Other settings such as [`Config::signals_based_traps`](struct.Config.html#method.signals_based_traps "method wasmtime::Config::signals_based_traps")

Embeddings using virtual memory almost always want at least some guard
region, but otherwise changes from the default should be profiled
locally to see the performance impact.

###### [§](#default)Default

The default value for this property is 32MiB on 64-bit platforms. This
allows eliminating almost all bounds checks on loads/stores with an
immediate offset of less than 32MiB. On 32-bit platforms this defaults
to 64KiB.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#1676-1679)
#### pub fn [memory\_reservation\_for\_growth](#method.memory_reservation_for_growth)(&mut self, bytes: [u64](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u64.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures the size, in bytes, of the extra virtual memory space
reserved after a linear memory is relocated.

This setting is used in conjunction with [`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation")
to configure what happens after a linear memory is relocated in the host
address space. If the initial size of a linear memory exceeds
[`Config::memory_reservation`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation "method wasmtime::Config::memory_reservation") or if it grows beyond that size
throughout its lifetime then this setting will be used.

When a linear memory is relocated it will initially look like this:

```
           memory.size
                │
         ◄──────┴─────►
┌───────┬──────────────┬───────┐
│ guard │  accessible  │ guard │
└───────┴──────────────┴───────┘
                        ◄──┬──►
                           │
                    memory_guard_size
```

where `accessible` needs to be grown but there’s no more memory to grow
into. A new region of the virtual address space will be allocated that
looks like this:

```
                          memory_reservation_for_growth
                                      │
           memory.size                │
                │                     │
         ◄──────┴─────► ◄─────────────┴───────────►
┌───────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────┐
│ guard │  accessible  │ .. reserved for growth .. │ guard │
└───────┴──────────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────┘
                                                    ◄──┬──►
                                                       │
                                              memory_guard_size
```

This means that up to `memory_reservation_for_growth` bytes can be
allocated again before the entire linear memory needs to be moved again
when another `memory_reservation_for_growth` bytes will be appended to
the size of the allocation.

Note that this is a currently simple heuristic for optimizing the growth
of dynamic memories, primarily implemented for the memory64 proposal
where the maximum size of memory is larger than 4GiB. This setting is
unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all style approach and if you’re an
embedder running into issues with growth and are interested in having
other growth strategies available here please feel free to [open an
issue on the Wasmtime repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/new)!

#### pub fn [guard\_before\_linear\_memory](#method.guard_before_linear_memory)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `signals-based-traps`** only.

Indicates whether a guard region is present before allocations of
linear memory.

Guard regions before linear memories are never used during normal
operation of WebAssembly modules, even if they have out-of-bounds
loads. The only purpose for a preceding guard region in linear memory
is extra protection against possible bugs in code generators like
Cranelift. This setting does not affect performance in any way, but will
result in larger virtual memory reservations for linear memories (it
won’t actually ever use more memory, just use more of the address
space).

The size of the guard region before linear memory is the same as the
guard size that comes after linear memory, which is configured by
[`Config::memory_guard_size`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_guard_size "method wasmtime::Config::memory_guard_size").

This configuration option is `true` by default and, if enabled,
generates the appropriate tables in compiled modules to map from native

program counters in backtraces as well as generating filenames/line
numbers if so configured as well (and the original wasm module has DWARF
debugging information present).

#### pub fn [memory\_init\_cow](#method.memory_init_cow)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `signals-based-traps`** only.

Configures whether copy-on-write memory-mapped data is used to
initialize a linear memory.

Initializing linear memory via a copy-on-write mapping can drastically
improve instantiation costs of a WebAssembly module because copying
memory is deferred. Additionally if a page of memory is only ever read
from WebAssembly and never written too then the same underlying page of
data will be reused between all instantiations of a module meaning that
if a module is instantiated many times this can lower the overall memory
required needed to run that module.

The main disadvantage of copy-on-write initialization, however, is that
it may be possible for highly-parallel scenarios to be less scalable. If
a page is read initially by a WebAssembly module then that page will be
mapped to a read-only copy shared between all WebAssembly instances. If
the same page is then written, however, then a private copy is created
and swapped out from the read-only version. This also requires an [IPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-processor_interrupt),
however, which can be a significant bottleneck in high-parallelism
situations.

This feature is only applicable when a WebAssembly module meets specific
criteria to be initialized in this fashion, such as:

* Only memories defined in the module can be initialized this way.
* Data segments for memory must use statically known offsets.
* Data segments for memory must all be in-bounds.

Modules which do not meet these criteria will fall back to
initialization of linear memory based on copying memory.

This feature of Wasmtime is also platform-specific:

* Linux - this feature is supported for all instances of [`Module`](struct.Module.html "struct wasmtime::Module").
  Modules backed by an existing mmap (such as those created by
  [`Module::deserialize_file`](struct.Module.html#method.deserialize_file "associated function wasmtime::Module::deserialize_file")) will reuse that mmap to cow-initialize
  memory. Other instance of [`Module`](struct.Module.html "struct wasmtime::Module") may use the `memfd_create`
  syscall to create an initialization image to `mmap`.
* Unix (not Linux) - this feature is only supported when loading modules
  from a precompiled file via [`Module::deserialize_file`](struct.Module.html#method.deserialize_file "associated function wasmtime::Module::deserialize_file") where there
  is a file descriptor to use to map data into the process. Note that
  the module must have been compiled with this setting enabled as well.
* Windows - there is no support for this feature at this time. Memory
  initialization will always copy bytes.

By default this option is enabled.

#### pub fn [force\_memory\_init\_memfd](#method.force_memory_init_memfd)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

A configuration option to force the usage of `memfd_create` on Linux to
be used as the backing source for a module’s initial memory image.

When [`Config::memory_init_cow`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_init_cow "method wasmtime::Config::memory_init_cow") is enabled, which is enabled by
default, module memory initialization images are taken from a module’s
original mmap if possible. If a precompiled module was loaded from disk
this means that the disk’s file is used as an mmap source for the
initial linear memory contents. This option can be used to force, on
Linux, that instead of using the original file on disk a new in-memory
file is created with `memfd_create` to hold the contents of the initial
image.

This option can be used to avoid possibly loading the contents of memory
from disk through a page fault. Instead with `memfd_create` the contents
of memory are always in RAM, meaning that even page faults which
initially populate a wasm linear memory will only work with RAM instead
of ever hitting the disk that the original precompiled module is stored
on.

This option is disabled by default.

Configures the “guaranteed dense image size” for copy-on-write
initialized memories.

When using the [`Config::memory_init_cow`](struct.Config.html#method.memory_init_cow "method wasmtime::Config::memory_init_cow") feature to initialize memory
efficiently (which is enabled by default), compiled modules contain an
image of the module’s initial heap. If the module has a fairly sparse
initial heap, with just a few data segments at very different offsets,
this could result in a large region of zero bytes in the image. In
other words, it’s not very memory-efficient.

We normally use a heuristic to avoid this: if less than half
of the initialized range (first non-zero to last non-zero
byte) of any memory in the module has pages with nonzero
bytes, then we avoid creating a memory image for the entire module.

However, if the embedder always needs the instantiation-time efficiency
of copy-on-write initialization, and is otherwise carefully controlling
parameters of the modules (for example, by limiting the maximum heap
size of the modules), then it may be desirable to ensure a memory image
is created even if this could go against the heuristic above. Thus, we
add another condition: there is a size of initialized data region up to
which we *always* allow a memory image. The embedder can set this to a
known maximum heap size if they desire to always get the benefits of
copy-on-write images.

In the future we may implement a “best of both worlds”
solution where we have a dense image up to some limit, and
then support a sparse list of initializers beyond that; this
would get most of the benefit of copy-on-write and pay the incremental
cost of eager initialization only for those bits of memory
that are out-of-bounds. However, for now, an embedder desiring
fast instantiation should ensure that this setting is as large
as the maximum module initial memory content size.

By default this value is 16 MiB.

#### pub fn [macos\_use\_mach\_ports](#method.macos_use_mach_ports)(&mut self, mach\_ports: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Configures whether, when on macOS, Mach ports are used for exception
handling instead of traditional Unix-based signal handling.

WebAssembly traps in Wasmtime are implemented with native faults, for
example a `SIGSEGV` will occur when a WebAssembly guest accesses
out-of-bounds memory. Handling this can be configured to either use Unix
signals or Mach ports on macOS. By default Mach ports are used.

Mach ports enable Wasmtime to work by default with foreign
error-handling systems such as breakpad which also use Mach ports to
handle signals. In this situation Wasmtime will continue to handle guest
faults gracefully while any non-guest faults will get forwarded to
process-level handlers such as breakpad. Some more background on this
can be found in #2456.

A downside of using mach ports, however, is that they don’t interact
well with `fork()`. Forking a Wasmtime process on macOS will produce a
child process that cannot successfully run WebAssembly. In this
situation traditional Unix signal handling should be used as that’s
inherited and works across forks.

If your embedding wants to use a custom error handler which leverages
Mach ports and you additionally wish to `fork()` the process and use
Wasmtime in the child process that’s not currently possible. Please
reach out to us if you’re in this bucket!

This option defaults to `true`, using Mach ports by default.

#### pub unsafe fn [detect\_host\_feature](#method.detect_host_feature)( &mut self, detect: [fn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.fn.html)(\_: &[str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html)) -> [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/option/enum.Option.html "enum core::option::Option")<[bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)>, ) -> &mut Self

Configures an embedder-provided function, `detect`, which is used to
determine if an ISA-specific feature is available on the current host.

This function is used to verify that any features enabled for a compiler
backend, such as AVX support on x86\_64, are also available on the host.
It is undefined behavior to execute an AVX instruction on a host that
doesn’t support AVX instructions, for example.

When the `std` feature is active on this crate then this function is
configured to a default implementation that uses the standard library’s
feature detection. When the `std` feature is disabled then there is no
default available and this method must be called to configure a feature
probing function.

The `detect` function provided is given a string name of an ISA feature.
The function should then return:

* `Some(true)` - indicates that the feature was found on the host and it
  is supported.
* `Some(false)` - the feature name was recognized but it was not
  detected on the host, for example the CPU is too old.
* `None` - the feature name was not recognized and it’s not known
  whether it’s on the host or not.

Feature names passed to `detect` match the same feature name used in the
Rust standard library. For example `"sse4.2"` is used on x86\_64.

##### [§](#unsafety)Unsafety

This function is `unsafe` because it is undefined behavior to execute
instructions that a host does not support. This means that the result of
`detect` must be correct for memory safe execution at runtime.

[Source](../src/wasmtime/config.rs.html#2482-2485)
#### pub fn [signals\_based\_traps](#method.signals_based_traps)(&mut self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> &mut Self

Available on **crate feature `signals-based-traps`** only.

Configures Wasmtime to not use signals-based trap handlers, for example
disables `SIGILL` and `SIGSEGV` handler registration on Unix platforms.

Wasmtime will by default leverage signals-based trap handlers (or the
platform equivalent, for example “vectored exception handlers” on
Windows) to make generated code more efficient. For example an
out-of-bounds load in WebAssembly will result in a `SIGSEGV` on Unix
that is caught by a signal handler in Wasmtime by default. Another
example is divide-by-zero is reported by hardware rather than
explicitly checked and Wasmtime turns that into a trap.

Some environments however may not have easy access to signal handlers.
For example embedded scenarios may not support virtual memory. Other
environments where Wasmtime is embedded within the surrounding
environment may require that new signal handlers aren’t registered due
to the global nature of signal handlers. This option exists to disable
the signal handler registration when required.

When signals-based trap handlers are disabled then generated code will
never rely on segfaults or other signals. Generated code will be slower
because bounds checks must be explicit along with other operations like
integer division which must check for zero.

When this option is disable it additionally requires that the
`enable_heap_access_spectre_mitigation` and
`enable_table_access_spectre_mitigation` Cranelift settings are
disabled. This means that generated code must have spectre mitigations
disabled. This is because spectre mitigations rely on faults from
loading from the null address to implement bounds checks.

This option defaults to `true` meaning that signals-based trap handlers
are enabled by default.

**Note** Disabling this option is not compatible with the Winch compiler.

# Miscompilation of wasm `i64x2.shr\_s` instruction with constant input on x86\_64

Low

[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)
published
GHSA-gw5p-q8mj-p7gh
Sep 14, 2023

## Package

cargo

wasmtime
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

10.0.0, 10.0.1, 11.0.0, 11.0.1, 12.0.0, 12.0.1

## Patched versions

10.0.2, 11.0.2, 12.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86\_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86\_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.

This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.

This issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.

### Patches

Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation.

### Workarounds

This issue only affects x86\_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to [disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd). Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @alexcrichton **[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)** commented [May 11, 2023](#issue-1706205831)

The previous implementation fell back to a scalar implementation by extracting lanes and re-inserting them. These operations are significantly more complicated without SSE 4.1, however. Comparing against LLVM's lowerings, as well, it looks like a different strategy is used which avoids extracting and inserting lanes. This commit updates to follow the strategy matched by LLVM's lowerings which additionally has the benefit of providing a non-SSE4.1 implementation.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hide comment

I guess since we're here we could remove this comment: "but this backend does not currently have support for EVEX encodings." That is no longer true and `vpsraq` is an instruction lowering that could be added eventually (an opposite direction from this PR which is adding lowerings for older features).

Sorry, something went wrong.

([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

10.0.0, 10.0.1, 11.0.0, 11.0.1, 12.0.0, 12.0.1

## Patched versions

10.0.2, 11.0.2, 12.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86\_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86\_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.

This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.

This issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.

### Patches

Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation.

### Workarounds

This issue only affects x86\_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to [disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd). Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
