### @alexcrichton **[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)** commented [May 11, 2023](#issue-1706205831)

The previous implementation fell back to a scalar implementation by extracting lanes and re-inserting them. These operations are significantly more complicated without SSE 4.1, however. Comparing against LLVM's lowerings, as well, it looks like a different strategy is used which avoids extracting and inserting lanes. This commit updates to follow the strategy matched by LLVM's lowerings which additionally has the benefit of providing a non-SSE4.1 implementation.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I guess since we're here we could remove this comment: "but this backend does not currently have support for EVEX encodings." That is no longer true and `vpsraq` is an instruction lowering that could be added eventually (an opposite direction from this PR which is adding lowerings for older features).

Sorry, something went wrong.

* x64: Fix an off-by-one in in `i64x2.shr_s`

This commit fixes a mistake from [bytecodealliance#6372](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6372) where one of the immediates to a
`pshufd` instruction was off-by-one in terms of bits. This fixes the
behavior of the wasm `i64x2.shr_s` instruction with constant shift
amounts larger than 32.

* Update release notes
