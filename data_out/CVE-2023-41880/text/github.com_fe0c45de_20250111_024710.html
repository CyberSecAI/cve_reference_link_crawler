# Miscompilation of wasm `i64x2.shr\_s` instruction with constant input on x86\_64

Low

[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)
published

Sep 14, 2023

## Package

cargo

wasmtime
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

10.0.0, 10.0.1, 11.0.0, 11.0.1, 12.0.0, 12.0.1

## Patched versions

10.0.2, 11.0.2, 12.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86\_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86\_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.

This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.

This issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.

### Patches

Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation.

### Workarounds

This issue only affects x86\_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to [disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd). Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
