* x64: Fix an off-by-one in in `i64x2.shr_s`

This commit fixes a mistake from [#6372](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6372) where one of the immediates to a
`pshufd` instruction was off-by-one in terms of bits. This fixes the
behavior of the wasm `i64x2.shr_s` instruction with constant shift
amounts larger than 32.

* Update release notes
