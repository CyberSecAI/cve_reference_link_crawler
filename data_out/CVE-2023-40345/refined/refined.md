Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-40345:

**Vulnerability:** Exposure of system-scoped credentials in Delphix Plugin

**Root Cause:** The Delphix Plugin does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup. This allows the use of system-scoped credentials, which are intended for global configuration, in contexts they should not be used.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Context for Credentials Lookup**: The plugin incorrectly fetches credentials without considering the intended scope (system vs. item-specific).

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Credential Access:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can access and capture system-scoped credentials that they are not authorized to use. This could lead to further compromise of the Jenkins environment or other systems where those credentials are valid.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Jenkins Permissions:**  The attacker must have Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance.

**Affected Plugin:** Delphix Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 3.0.2 and earlier

**Fixed Version:** 3.0.3

**Additional Notes:** This vulnerability is identified as "SECURITY-3214 (2)" in the Jenkins Security Advisory.
