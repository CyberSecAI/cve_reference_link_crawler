your patch is great but it doesn't prevent the injection. malicious users can inject the other fields like a date by modifying post data sent to the server. other problem is it's very difficult to maintain the code in the future if we just added the sanitization during the output. Its better to filter once during registration in signup.php, admin/atask/add.php setting.php

htmlspecialchars is specifically designed to convert characters that have special meaning in HTML (like <, >, ", ', and &) into their respective HTML entities. This means even if you provide these characters using JavaScript's String.fromCharCode, they will still be converted to their safe representations when htmlspecialchars is applied to them. so my answer is no !

# Stored XSS BUG

Moderate

[fobybus](/fobybus)
published
GHSA-2jxx-r967-f76p
Aug 8, 2023

## Package

profile.php, home.php

## Affected versions

1.0.0 , 1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.3

## Description

Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of web security vulnerability caused by improper input validation and inadequate data sanitization in a web application. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually in the form of HTML or JavaScript) into a website's database or storage, which is then fetched and displayed to unsuspecting users. These scripts are executed in the browsers of those who visit the infected page, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data, and potentially take control of the user's account or perform malicious actions on their behalf.

### Patches

THE problem is patched in v1.0.3

### Severity

Moderate

5.4

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
