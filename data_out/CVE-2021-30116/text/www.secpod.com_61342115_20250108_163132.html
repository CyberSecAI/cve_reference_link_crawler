### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**
