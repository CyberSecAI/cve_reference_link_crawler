The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47240.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect size check in the `qrtr_endpoint_post` function within the Linux kernel's qrtr module. Specifically, the `size` variable was declared as an `unsigned int`, but it should have been `size_t`. This caused an integer overflow when `size` was a large value (e.g., 4294967293), leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability due to the wrong type used for the size variable
- Out-of-bounds read when copying data using skb_put_data, due to the incorrect size value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a system crash, denial of service, or potential information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted qrtr message with a specific size value in the header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send qrtr messages, which typically requires local access or a compromised device on the same network.
