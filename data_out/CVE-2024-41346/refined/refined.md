- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input passed in the `param` POST parameter before outputting it in the `submit.php` file, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Reflected XSS vulnerability in `submit.php` due to unsanitized output of the `$_POST["param"]` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request with a JavaScript payload in the `param` parameter of a POST request. The user must be logged in to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice the victim to submit the malicious POST request to the vulnerable `submit.php` endpoint after logging into the application.
