# OpenSearch Issue with tenant read-only permissions

Moderate

Oct 16, 2023

## Package

docker

OpenSearch
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<1.3.14.0, <2.11.0.0

## Patched versions

maven

org.opensearch.plugin:opensearch-security

=>1.3.14.0, =>2.11.0.0

## Description

### Impact

There is an issue with the implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch Dashboards where authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant can perform create, edit and delete operations on index metadata of dashboards and visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering them unavailable.

This issue does not affect index data, only metadata. Dashboards correctly enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents. This issue does not provide additional read access to data users don’t already have.

### Mitigation

This issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the cluster. Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (<https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/>) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
