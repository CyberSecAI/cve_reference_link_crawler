- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue in the implementation of tenant permissions within OpenSearch Dashboards allows authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant to perform create, edit, and delete operations on index metadata for dashboards and visualizations in that tenant.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper authorization/permission control, specifically in how read-only tenant access is enforced for index metadata operations related to dashboards and visualizations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Authenticated users with read-only tenant access can modify or delete index metadata, potentially rendering dashboards and visualizations unavailable. This does not affect underlying index data or provide additional read access to data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation via the OpenSearch Dashboards interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with read-only access to a specific tenant in OpenSearch Dashboards.
