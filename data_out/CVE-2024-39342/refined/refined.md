{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a static hard-coded key for its custom AES encryption process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Hardcoded cryptographic key",
    "Improper encryption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Decryption of sensitive information leading to privilege escalation on the Windows host.",
  "Attack vectors": "Gaining access to the encrypted password obtained from the vulnerable WebAPI.cfg.xml file (CVE-2024-39341) and using the hardcoded key to decrypt it.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first gain access to the WebAPI.cfg.xml file. Additionally the attacker needs to know the location of the DCG.Security.dll to extract the hardcoded key"
