- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition during user self-registration in Apache StreamPipes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** TOCTOU race condition allows multiple requests for account creation with the same email address before the registration is finalized.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create multiple identical user accounts with the same email address, corrupting StreamPipes' user management.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker would exploit the self-registration functionality by sending concurrent requests to create user accounts with the same email address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send multiple concurrent requests to the StreamPipes application's self-registration endpoint.
