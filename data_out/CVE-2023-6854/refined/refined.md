Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied post meta fields within the Breakdance plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are saved within the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, specifically post meta fields, allowing malicious code to be stored.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of user-supplied content on the page, allowing stored scripts to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Administrator account takeover

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom Post Meta Fields:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into post meta fields, specifically when using dynamic data capabilities to display the content on the front end.
*   **Plugin:** Breakdance plugin is the source of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level access or above on the WordPress site. This level of access grants the ability to create and edit posts and custom fields.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Usage:** The attacker needs to understand how the Breakdance plugin uses dynamic data features to display user-supplied content on the front-end.
*   **Vulnerable Plugin Version:** The target site must be running a vulnerable version of the Breakdance plugin (<= 1.7.0).

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Francesco Carlucci.
* The vulnerability was addressed in Breakdance version 1.7.1.
* The fix involves filtering dynamic data from users without the 'unfiltered_html' capability by default. An option to bypass the filter is available in plugin settings for advanced users.
