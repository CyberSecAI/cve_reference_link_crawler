- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Oracle database password is being logged in plain text within the Apache Linkis data source module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Exposure of sensitive information (database password) in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the Oracle database if an attacker gains access to the log files.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the server's log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the log files where the Oracle database password is being logged.
