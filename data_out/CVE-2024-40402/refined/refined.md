Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the `ajax.php` file of the Simple Library Management System. The application directly incorporates the `username` parameter from user input into SQL queries without sanitizing or validating.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `username` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, enabling the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `ajax.php` with the `username` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- **Username Parameter:** The specific vulnerable parameter is the `username` parameter within the POST request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send POST requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `username` parameter in `ajax.php` is vulnerable.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs SQL knowledge to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details (From Content):**

- **Vulnerable File:** `ajax.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `username`
- **Vulnerability Types:** The vulnerability can be exploited as boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
- **Exploitation Requires No Login:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log in or be authorized to access the application.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided content includes example payloads for both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
- **SQLMap Usage:** The content provides an example of how the sqlmap tool could be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Suggested Repairs:** The report suggests using prepared statements with parameter binding, strict input validation, minimal database permissions and regular security audits as remediation.
