- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a heap-based and stack-based buffer overflow in the video framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based and stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may lead to a denial of service by affecting the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present within the video framework.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to trigger the vulnerable code within the video framework by supplying specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer size.
