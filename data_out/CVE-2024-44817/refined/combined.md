# ZZCMS 2023 SQL注入漏洞user/adv2.php

## CVE-ID

CVE-2024-44817

## Vulnerability type

Insecure Permissions

## Vendor of the product(s)

<http://www.zzcms.net/about/download.html>

## Affected product(s)/code base

## Product \* Version

ZZCMS
<=2023(latest)

## Optional

Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability? No

## Attack type info

Remote

Other : With administrator rights, attacker can delete any file.

## Affected component(s)

```
File: user/adv2.php
Line: 69
Vulnerable Code:
$rs = query("select * from zzcms_ad where id=" . $_POST["id"] . "");

```

## Attack vector(s)

```
We can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request with a payload such as:

POST action=modify&id=0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,user(),3,4,5,6 #

This payload allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions within the database.

```

## Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE

```
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the user/adv2.php file of the affected application, specifically at line 69. The vulnerable code constructs a SQL query using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting arbitrary SQL code through the id parameter in a POST request.
