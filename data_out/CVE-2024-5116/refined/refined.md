Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly sanitize and validate user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `save.php` file takes the `vote` parameter from the request and directly inserts it into an SQL UPDATE statement without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the query.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries:  The `$_REQUEST['vote']` variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Lack of parameterized queries:  Prepared statements are not used, which would prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering, specifically modifying voting data.
- Potential for complete system control
- Service disruption
- Execution of arbitrary SQL queries, including adding, modifying or deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `save.php` with a maliciously crafted `vote` parameter.
- No login or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `save.php` endpoint.
- No special privileges or authentication are needed.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `save.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `vote` (HTTP GET parameter)
- Vulnerable Code Snippet (simplified):
  ```php
  <?php
  require('connection.php');
  $vote = $_REQUEST['vote'];
  mysqli_query($conn, "UPDATE tbCandidates SET candidate_cvotes=candidate_cvotes+1 WHERE candidate_name='$vote'");
  mysqli_close($conn);
  ?>
  ```

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
- The provided PoC uses a time-based blind SQL injection payload:
   ```
   vote=test 'AND (SELECT 5530 From (SELECT (SLEEP (5))) wnWB) -- AWBQ
   ```
   This payload injects a `SLEEP(5)` function into the SQL query. If the injected SQL is valid, the database will pause for 5 seconds, revealing the presence of the vulnerability.
- SQLmap is used to automate the exploitation process and extract database information.
   - Example `sqlmap` commands are given to enumerate databases and tables.
  ```
   python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.31.216:8115/save.php?vote=test" --batch --risk=3 --level=5 --dbs
   python sqlmap.py -u "192.168.31.216:8115/registeracc.php" --data="firstname=11&lastname=11&email=123@qq.com&password=123456&ConfirmPassword=123456&submit=Register Account" -p email --dbms=mysql --risk=3 --level=5 --batch -D poll --tables
  ```

**Suggested Repair:**
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to separate SQL code from user-supplied data.
- Implement strict input validation to ensure that the `vote` parameter conforms to the expected format and type.
- Implement proper error handling to prevent the display of SQL error messages to users.
- Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to the database user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the "Online Polling System" project, but the vulnerability is also present in the "Online Examination System Project"
- The `save.php` file is part of the application that processes votes
- The provided GitHub issue describes the vulnerability in detail.
