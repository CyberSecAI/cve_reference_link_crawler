Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `print.php` file of the SourceCodester Petrol Pump Management Software v1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization and validation. It uses the `id` parameter to construct SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject malicious SQL statements to access, modify or delete sensitive information from the database. This could include user credentials, financial data, or other sensitive information related to the petrol pump operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable `print.php` file with a crafted `id` parameter that includes SQL injection code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests. They do not appear to require any special privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `print.php` file of SourceCodester Petrol Pump Management Software v1.0. The `id` parameter is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization. By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to severe data breaches.
