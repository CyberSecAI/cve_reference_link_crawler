- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Home Assistant Companion app for iOS and macOS (versions prior to 2023.7) is vulnerable to Client-Side Request Forgery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Client-Side Request Forgery, potentially leading to arbitrary service invocation and Denial of Service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft malicious links or QR codes that, when opened by a victim, cause the app to execute arbitrary services in the victim's Home Assistant installation. Combined with another vulnerability (GHSA-4r74-h49q-rr3h), this could lead to full compromise and remote code execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious links or QR codes sent to a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious link or QR code to the victim. The attacker does not need any privileges on the system. The user has to interact with the malicious link for the attack to be successful.
