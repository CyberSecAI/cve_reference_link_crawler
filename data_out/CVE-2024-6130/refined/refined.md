Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Form Maker by 10Web" does not properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the classname field of form elements. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization and output escaping in the plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view a form.
- The attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges or a user role that allows them to modify the plugin settings.
- The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload into the classname field of a form field within the plugin settings.
- The payload is then stored and executed when the form is rendered and viewed by other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access (or a high-privileged role that can edit form settings) to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to access the plugin's settings page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specifically in the "Form Maker by 10Web" plugin, versions prior to 1.15.26.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, which is often done in multisite setups.
- The Proof of Concept clearly describes how to inject the payload and trigger the vulnerability.
