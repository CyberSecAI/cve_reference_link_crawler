## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form Maker by 10Web < 1.15.26 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

- Open the plugin settings
- Edit an existing form or create a new one
- Click on the edit icon for any of the form fields
- Change the classname field to something like ""><svg src=x onload=alert(1)>" and save
- Verify that the payload is executed when the form is rendered.

### Affects Plugins
