{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'myGAKUYA' on Line exposes the channel access token in the client-side response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200). The channel access token, which should be kept secret, is leaked.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the exposed channel access token to broadcast malicious messages to 'myGAKUYA' users, potentially leading to phishing, fraud, or other harmful activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker only needs to have Line installed and access the 'myGAKUYA' mini-app. The channel access token is present in the response to the request made to www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to open the 'myGAKUYA' mini-app within the Line application and intercept the network response, which contains the channel access token. No other specific privileges or capabilities are required."
