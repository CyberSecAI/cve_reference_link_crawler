Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The commit message "fixed XSS vulnerability" and the code changes strongly suggest that the root cause was the way the application was handling user input or data when generating the HTML for the calendar. Specifically, the changes involve modifying script tags and their source paths which suggests the XSS was likely related to the way the application was constructing these scripts. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is XSS. The code changes show modifications to how JavaScript files are included within the HTML documents. Specifically, it appears the vulnerability was caused due to the incorrect use of the `document.write` function with dynamically generated URLs. If the `gTheme` variables could be controlled by an attacker, it would be possible to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed within the context of the user's browser, if the values in  `gTheme`  are not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Deface the website.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   Potentially gain access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `gTheme` variables, which are used to construct the URLs for Javascript files included in the calendar's HTML. An attacker could inject malicious javascript code through a crafted URL if they could influence `gTheme` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to find a way to control or influence the values of the `gTheme` variables that are used to construct script URLs via the document.write statements. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or any system that affects the behavior of the calendar application.

**Code changes:**

The code changes replaces `<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' "+\_charset+" src='"+` with `<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' "+\_charset+" src='./"
In addition the following lines changed:
`write("<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' "+\_charset+" src='"+(gTheme[4]?gTheme[4]+(/\?/.test(gTheme[4])?"&":"?"):"plugins.js?")+(\_cacheOther?0:gd.getTime())+"'></scr"+"ipt>");`
`write("<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' "+\_charset+" src='./"+(gTheme[4]?gTheme[4]+(/\?/.test(gTheme[4])?"&":"?"):"plugins.js?")+(\_cacheOther?0:gd.getTime())+"'></scr"+"ipt>");`
and
`if (gTheme[2]&&!\_\_isAS) document.write("<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' src='"+gTheme[2]+(gbCacheAgenda?"":(/\?/.test(gTheme[2])?"&":"?")+gd.getTime())+"'></scr"+"ipt>");`
`if (gTheme[2]&&!\_\_isAS) document.write("<scr"+"ipt type='text/javascript' src='./"+gTheme[2]+(gbCacheAgenda?"":(/\?/.test(gTheme[2])?"&":"?")+gd.getTime())+"'></scr"+"ipt>");`

The changes modify how Javascript files are included. The change from `src='` to `src='./` implies a fix where the base path is restricted so that Javascript files can't be loaded from an arbitrary URL, preventing an attacker from injecting remote script files.
