Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stack overflow in `ecma_find_named_property` (ecma-helpers.c) and `ecma_lcache_lookup` (ecma-lcache.c) within the JerryScript engine.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability in `ecma_find_named_property` is triggered by a recursive call.
- The vulnerability in `ecma_lcache_lookup` is caused by a potential recursive call within the function. Both are triggered by a crafted JavaScript payload using `Array.prototype.flat`.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of stack overflow checks within the `ecma_find_named_property` and `ecma_lcache_lookup` functions.
- The `Array.prototype.flat` function can be used to create recursive data structures that trigger the stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow leading to denial of service (crashes) of the JerryScript engine.
- Potentially other consequences based on the ability to control the stack through crafted input.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious JavaScript payload.
- Executing the payload within a vulnerable instance of the JerryScript engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide input that is processed by the JerryScript engine.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable function and how it is impacted by `Array.prototype.flat`.
- Ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code.

**Additional Details:**
- Both issues are triggered by the same javascript snippet.
- The issue was found by the OWL337 team.
- Both issues were resolved by adding stack overflow checks in `Array.prototype.{flat, flatMap}`
