- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the use of a default static username and password combination for accessing the GUI of Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) on Cisco vManage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded credentials (CWE-798) are present in the authentication mechanism of the SD-AVC GUI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the SD-AVC GUI, potentially enabling them to view managed device names, SD-AVC logs, and SD-AVC DNS server IP addresses.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and requires network access to the exposed SD-AVC GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the exposed SD-AVC GUI, which is typically accessible on self-managed cloud installations or local server installations of Cisco vManage. No authentication is required due to the use of the static credentials.
