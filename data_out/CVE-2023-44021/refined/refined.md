{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `formSetClientState` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `formSetClientState` function reads four user-provided parameters using `sprintf` and passes them to a stack-based buffer (`var238`) without any length checks. This lack of bounds checking leads to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or achieve remote code execution (RCE) by overflowing the stack buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetClientState` endpoint with oversized parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means they need to be on the same network as the device or have a way to access it remotely."
