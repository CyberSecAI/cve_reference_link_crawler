# Eleven Vulnerabilities Patched in Royal Elementor Addons

On December 23, 2022, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team initiated the responsible disclosure process for a set of 11 vulnerabilities in Royal Elementor Addons, a WordPress plugin with over 100,000 installations. The plugin developers responded on December 26, and we sent over the full disclosure that day.

We released a firewall rule protecting against these vulnerabilities to [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-premium/), [Care](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-care/), and [Response](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-response/) customers on December 23, 2022. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection 30 days later, on January 22, 2023.

While none of the vulnerabilities were critical, several of them could have been used by any authenticated user to modify content, disable plugins, or even temporarily take down the site in some circumstances. Additionally one of the patched vulnerabilities was a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability which could have been used to take over the site if an attacker was able to trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link.

## Vulnerability Details

The primary set of issues we found with Royal Elementor Addons was due to a lack of access control and nonce checks on various AJAX actions in the plugin.

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Theme Activation](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-theme-activation)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4700

**CVSS Score**: 5.4 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons has an option to quickly activate the recommended Royal Elementor Kit theme. Unfortunately, this is performed via an AJAX function, `wpr_activate_required_theme`, which did not perform capability or nonce checks, or even check if the theme was installed on the site. This meant that any logged-in user, such as a subscriber, could change a vulnerable site’s theme. If the Royal Elementor Kit theme was not installed on the site, this would result in a loss of availability as the site would fail to load and instead display an error message.

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Plugin Deactivation](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-plugin-deactivation)

**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4702

**CVSS Score**: 5.4 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons has an option to revert the site to a “compatible” state for imported templates via the `wpr_fix_royal_compatibility` AJAX function. This involves deactivating all but a short list of hard-coded plugins. As the function did not use capability or nonce checks, this means that any authenticated user could deactivate plugins necessary for site functionality as well as any security plugins that do not specifically block this action. This could cause the site to become unavailable or vulnerable to additional exploits.

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons allows importing preset templates via the `wpr_import_templates_kit` AJAX function. Vulnerable versions of the plugin do not include capability or nonce check for this function, so any authenticated user could import templates, potentially overwriting any existing templates.

---

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Plugin Activation](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-plugin-activation)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4701

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Low)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons has an option to activate the ‘contact-form-7’, ‘media-library-assistant’, or ‘woocommerce’ plugins if they are installed on the site via the `wpr_activate_required_plugins` AJAX action, and this functionality was available to any logged-in user. Fortunately the impact of this vulnerability is quite minimal as it would only allow an attacker to activate three select plugins.

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Import Deletion](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-import-deletion)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4703

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Low)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons has an AJAX action, `wpr_reset_previous_import`, used to delete previously imported content when importing new content. However, since it is accessible to any authenticated user, this could be used to delete imported content without importing new content, potentially resulting in site availability issues.

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons uses the `wpr_final_settings_setup` AJAX action to finalize activation of preset site configuration templates, which can be chosen and imported via a separate action. As with the other vulnerabilities recorded here, any authenticated user could access this functionality, though the impact of this vulnerability was lower.

---

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Menu Settings Update](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-menu-settings-update)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons uses the `wpr_save_mega_menu_settings` AJAX action to update mega menu settings. As with the other vulnerabilities we found, this action called a function that did not include a capability check or a nonce check, so any authenticated user could update menu settings.

---

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Template Conditions Modification](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-template-conditions-modification)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons uses the `wpr_save_template_conditions` AJAX action to save template conditions, determining when a given template will be displayed and used. The action called a function that was accessible to any authenticated user.

---

**Description**: [Insufficient Access Control to Template Kit Import](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-insufficient-access-control-to-template-kit-import)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Low)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Royal Elementor Addons uses the `wpr_import_library_template` AJAX action to import and activate templates from the plugin developers’ template library. As with other vulnerabilities reported here, the action called a function that did not include a capability or nonce check, allowing any authenticated user to access it.

---

The final vulnerabilities we found did not exactly fit the pattern of the others – one was a lower-severity Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF) and the other, a higher-severity reflected Cross-Site Scripting(XSS).

**Description**: [Cross-Site Request Forgery to Menu Template creation](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-cross-site-request-forgery-to-menu-template-creation)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4707

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Low)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Unlike the other AJAX actions we’ve mentioned so far, `wpr_create_mega_menu_template`, which is used to create new menu templates, did include access control. It was, however, still lacking a nonce check, so an attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action that would result in a menu template being created.

**Description**: [Reflected Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/royal-elementor-addons/royal-elementor-addons-1359-reflected-cross-site-scripting)**Affected Plugin**: Royal Elementor Addons

**Plugin Slug**: royal-elementor-addons

**Affected Versions**: <= 1.3.59

**CVE ID**: CVE-2022-4710

**CVSS Score**: 6.1 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Researcher/s**: Ramuel Gall

**Fully Patched Version**: 1.3.60

Unlike all of the other vulnerabilities mentioned above, reflected cross-site scripting(XSS) can be used by an attacker to completely take over a website if they can trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link, by performing actions as that administrator, such as adding a new malicious administrator, or inserting a backdoor into a plugin or theme file.

Additionally, unauthenticated users could also be targeted by this to redirect them to a malicious website or perform actions in their browsers. In this case, the `data_fetch` function failed to escape the `wpr_ajax_search_link_target` parameter used to return search results. Note that *all* Wordfence users, including Wordfence free users, are protected against exploits targeting this rule by the Wordfence firewall’s built-in Cross-Site Scripting protection.
