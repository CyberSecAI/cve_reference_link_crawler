**UPDATE:**Â [Read our full analysis of CVE-2024-1709 & CVE-2024-1708 and detection guidance here.](https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass)

On February 19, 2024, ConnectWise released an [advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8) related to the disclosure of two vulnerabilities affecting their ScreenConnect software. This advisory was tagged by ConnectWise with a severity of âCriticalâ and a priority of â1 - High.â

The Huntress team was able to successfully reproduce and weaponize the vulnerability for ***CWE-288 Authentication bypass using an alternate path of channel***. The POC for this vulnerability was recreated with ease and required minimal technical knowledge and resources. Given this, Huntress immediately [released a post](https://www.huntress.com/blog/vulnerability-reproduced-immediately-patch-screenconnect-23-9-8) on this vulnerability and its potential impact. While Huntress strongly recommends **immediately patching any ConnectWise software to version 23.9.8**, the following is detection guidance for defense-in-depth.

Upon executing the POC, Huntress examined the **[.highlight]User.xml[.highlight]** file located in: **[.highlight]C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Data\[.highlight]**. The contents of this file may contain the following:

```

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Users xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
 <User>
  <CreationDate>[IMPACT-TIMESTAMP]</CreationDate>
  <Email>anyemailaddress@theinternet.com</Email>
  <IsApproved>true</IsApproved>
  <IsLockedOut>false</IsLockedOut>
  <LastActivityDate>0001-01-01T00:00:00</LastActivityDate>
  <LastLockoutDate>0001-01-01T00:00:00</LastLockoutDate>
  <LastLoginDate>0001-01-01T00:00:00</LastLoginDate>
  <LastPasswordChangedDate>[IMPACT-TIMESTAMP]</LastPasswordChangedDate>
  <PasswordAttemptWindowStartTime>0001-01-01T00:00:00>/PasswordAttemptWindowStartTime>
  <InvalidPasswordWindowAttemptCount>0</InvalidPasswordWindowAttemptCount>
  <InvalidPasswordAbsoluteAttemptCount>0</InvalidPasswordAbsoluteAttemptCount>
  <Name>Administrator</Name>
  <PasswordHashHistory>
   <base64Binary>[REDACTED-BASE64]</base64Binary>
  </PasswordHashHistory>
  <Roles>
   <string>Control Administrator</string>
  </Roles>
 </User>
</Users>

```

Note that the **[.highlight]0001-01-01T00:00:00[.highlight]** timestamps indicate that there is no sane value *yet*. When a new user is just created, it does not yet have a **[.highlight]LastLoginDate[.highlight]** or **[.highlight]LastActivityDate[.highlight]**.

To be clear, this **[.highlight]User.xml[.highlight]** file will be modified *any time any user performs any activity.* This was verified via [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) that this **[.highlight]User.xml[.highlight]** file was overwritten after each successful attempt. This makes definitive identification of exploitation difficult, but unfortunately from our investigation, we found limited options for logging and forensic artifacts on a ScreenConnect server. If the newly created user were to log in, the timestamps would, of course, be updated. If the timestamps are not nulled, then this would indicate that the user has actually logged into the instance recently.

*Figure 1: Procmon activity during exploitation*

Itâs important to note that the **[.highlight]<random\_value>.xml[.highlight]** file in **[.highlight]C:\Windows\Temp\ScreenConnect\23.9.7.8804\[.highlight]** is created on disk, but immediately removed. The GUID in the file name appears to be unique for each instance. These files are recoverable via disk forensics, however, which can help you recover previous attacker activities.

By configuring a hostâs Advanced Auditing policy to log a successful [Windows Event ID 4663](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4663) event and with a SACL set on the directory, we can see when the file is being modified.

*Figure 3: Security Event ID 4663 During ScreenConnect Exploit*

This event can be forwarded to a SIEM, and with the contents of the [.highlight]**User.xml**[.highlight] file itself, we have a greater level of context to examine if an attack has occurred.

The aforementioned artifacts may be reviewed for DFIR/threat hunting purposes if an attacker has leveraged this exploit against a target system to see if an account was created outside of normal operating procedures. However, the artifacts alone may not be enough for a definitive indication or provide enough context for analysis and triage to indicate that the exploit was leveraged.

In addition to the artifacts mentioned in this blog, we also observed evidence of exploit execution within the IIS logs. We will forgo demonstrating the contents of these IIS log entries for now, until weâve seen exploitation in the wild since doing so would tip our hand to the attackers.

Happy Hunting!Â Â

# ConnectWise urges ScreenConnect admins to patch critical RCE flaw

![Hacker remote displays](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2023/09/12/hacker-staring.jpg)

ConnectWise warned customers to patch their ScreenConnect servers immediately against a maximum severity flaw that can be used in remote code execution (RCE) attacks.

This security bug is due to an [authentication bypass](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html) weakness that attackers can exploit to gain access to confidential data or execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable servers in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction.

The company also patched a [path traversal](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) vulnerability in its remote desktop software, which can only be abused by attackers with high privileges.

"Vulnerabilities were reported February 13, 2024, through our vulnerability disclosure channel via the ConnectWise Trust Center," ConnectWise [warned](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8).

"There is no evidence that these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, but immediate action must be taken by on-premise partners to address these identified security risks."

ConnectWise has yet to assign CVE IDs to the two security flaws that impact all servers running ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and prior.

While ScreenConnect cloud servers hosted on screenconnect.com cloud or hostedrmm.com are already secured against potential attacks, admins using on-premise software are advised [to update their servers](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Upgrade_an_on-premises_installation) to ScreenConnect version 23.9.8 immediately.

Huntress security researchers [reported](https://www.huntress.com/blog/vulnerability-reproduced-immediately-patch-screenconnect-23-9-8) earlier today that they've already created a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that can be used to bypass authentication on unpatched ScreenConnect servers.

Huntress added that a search on the Censys exposure management platform allowed them to find more than 8,800 servers vulnerable to attacks.

Shodan also tracks [over 7,600 ScreenConnect servers](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=%22Server%3A+ScreenConnect%22), with only 160 currently running the patched [ScreenConnect 23.9.8 version](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=%22Server%3A+ScreenConnect%2F23.9.8%22).

![ScreenConnect servers](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2024/ScreenConnect%20servers.jpg)

*ScreenConnect servers reachable over the Internet (Shodan)*

​Last month, CISA, the NSA, and MS-ISAC issued a joint advisory [warning](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-federal-agencies-hacked-using-legitimate-remote-desktop-tools/) that attackers increasingly use legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software such as ConnectWise ScreenConnect for malicious purposes.

By using remote desktop software as an entry point into their targets' networks, threat actors can access their systems as local users without requiring admin permissions or new complete software installations.

This allows them to bypass security controls and gain access to other devices on the network by taking advantage of the compromised user's permissions.

Attackers have been using ScreenConnect for malicious purposes for years, including stealing data and [deploying ransomware payloads](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/screenconnect-msp-software-used-to-install-zeppelin-ransomware/) across victims' breached systems.

More recently, Huntress also spotted threat actors using local ScreenConnect instances [for persistent access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-healthcare-orgs-via-screenconnect-remote-access/) to hacked networks.

# Researchers warn high-risk ConnectWise flaw under attack is ’embarrassingly easy’ to exploit

## ‘I can’t sugarcoat it — this shit is bad,’ said Huntress’ CEO

[Carly Page](https://techcrunch.com/author/carly-page/)

9:31 AM PST · February 21, 2024

Security experts are warning that a high-risk vulnerability in a widely used remote access tool is “trivial and embarrassingly easy” to exploit, as the software’s developer confirms malicious hackers are actively exploiting the flaw.

The maximum severity-rated vulnerability affects ConnectWise ScreenConnect (formerly ConnectWise Control), a popular remote access software that allows managed IT providers and technicians to provide real-time remote technical support on customer systems.

The flaw is described as an authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow an attacker to remotely steal confidential data from vulnerable servers or deploy malicious code, such as malware. The vulnerability was first reported to ConnectWise on February 13, and the company [publicly disclosed details of the bug in a security advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8) published on February 19.

ConnectWise initially said there was no indication of public exploitation, but noted in an update on Tuesday that ConnectWise confirmed it has “received updates of compromised accounts that our incident response team have been able to investigate and confirm.”

The company also shared three IP addresses which it says “were recently used by threat actors.”

When asked by TechCrunch, ConnectWise spokesperson Amanda Lee declined to say how many customers are affected but noted that ConnectWise has seen “limited reports” of suspected intrusions. Lee added that 80% of customer environments are cloud-based and were patched automatically within 48 hours.

When asked if ConnectWise is aware of any data exfiltration or whether it has the means to detect if any data was accessed, Lee said “there has been no data exfiltration reported to us.”

Florida-based ConnectWise provides its remote access technology to more than a million small to medium-sized businesses, its website says.

Cybersecurity company Huntress on Wednesday [published an analysis](https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass) of the actively exploited ConnectWise vulnerability. Huntress security researcher John Hammond told TechCrunch that Huntress is aware of “current and active” exploitation, and is seeing early signs of threat actors moving on to “more focused post-exploitation and persistence mechanisms.”

“We are seeing adversaries already deploy Cobalt Strike beacons and even install a ScreenConnect client onto the affected server itself,” said Hammond, referring to the popular exploitation framework Cobalt Strike, used both by security researchers for testing and abused by malicious hackers to break into networks. “We can expect more of these compromises in the very near future.”

Huntress CEO Kyle Hanslovan added that Huntress’ own customer telemetry shows visibility into more than 1,600 vulnerable servers.

“I can’t sugarcoat it — this shit is bad. We’re talking upwards of ten thousand servers that control hundreds of thousands of endpoints,” Hanslovan told TechCrunch, noting that upwards of 8,800 ConnectWise servers remain vulnerable to exploitation.

Hanslovan added that due to the “sheer prevalence of this software and the access afforded by this vulnerability signals we are on the cusp of a ransomware free-for-all.”

ConnectWise has released a patch for the actively exploited vulnerability and is urging on-premise ScreenConnect users to apply the fix immediately. ConnectWise also released a fix for a separate vulnerability affecting its remote desktop software. Lee told TechCrunch that the company has seen no evidence that this flaw has been exploited.

Earlier this year, U.S. government agencies CISA and the National Security Agency [warned](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/26/us-federal-agencies-hacked-remote-access-tools/) that they had observed a “widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software” — including ConnectWise SecureConnect — to target multiple federal civilian executive branch agencies.

The U.S. agencies also observed hackers abusing remote access software from AnyDesk, which was earlier this month forced to reset passwords and revoke certificates after [finding evidence](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/05/remote-access-giant-anydesk-resets-passwords-and-revokes-certificates-after-hack/) of compromised production systems.

In response to inquiries by TechCrunch, Eric Goldstein, CISA executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said: “CISA is aware of a reported vulnerability impacting ConnectWise ScreenConnect and we are working to understand potential exploitation in order to provide necessary guidance and assistance.”

02/19/2024

Products:
ScreenConnect

Severity:
Critical

Priority:
1 - High

**February 27, 2024 update:**

**Cloud partner summary**:

**On-prem partner summary**:

On-prem partners are advised to immediately upgrade to the latest version of ScreenConnect to remediate against reported vulnerabilities.

**Active maintenance**If you are on active maintenance, we strongly recommend upgrading to the most current release of 23.9.8 or later. Using the most current release of ScreenConnect includes security updates, bug fixes, and enhancements not found in older releases.

**Off maintenance****ConnectWise has provided a patched version of 22.4.20001 available to any partner regardless of maintenance status as an interim step to mitigate the vulnerability.** If you are not currently under maintenance, please upgrade your servers to version 22.4.20001 at minimum or to your latest eligible patched version that includes the remediation for CVE-2024-1709.

**(Updated) Addressing license errors:**If a license error arises during the upgrade, please stop the four ScreenConnect services (Session Manager, Security Manager, Web Server, Relay), move the “**License.xml”** file from the installation folder “**C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Data\License.xml**” to another location such as Desktop, and proceed with the upgrade. After the upgrade is complete, the license key will need to be re-added by stopping the four services and dropping the file back into the App\_Data folder.

**February 23, 2024 update:**

ICYMI: ConnectWise has taken an exception step to support partners no longer under maintenance by making them eligible to install [version 22.4](https://screenconnect.product.connectwise.com/communities/26/topics/3980-connectwise-control-224) at no additional cost, which will fix CVE-2024-1709, the critical vulnerability. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends on-premise partners upgrade to remain within maintenance  to gain access to all security and product enhancements.

**February 22, 2024 update:**

ConnectWise has rolled out an additional mitigation step for unpatched, on-premise users that suspends an instance if it is not on version 23.9.8 or later. If your instance is found to be on an outdated version, an alert will be sent with instructions on how to perform the necessary actions to release the server.

To [upgrade your version](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Upgrade_an_on-premises_installation "https://docs.connectwise.com/connectwise_screenconnect_documentation/on-premises/get_started_with_connectwise_screenconnect_on-premise/upgrade_an_on-premises_installation") to our latest 23.9 release, please follow this upgrade path:

**February 21, 2024 update\*:**

**Cloud partner summary**: Cloud partners are remediated against both vulnerabilities reported on February 19. No further action is required from any cloud partner (“screenconnect.com” cloud and “hostedrmm.com”).

**On-prem partner summary**: On-prem partners are advised to immediately upgrade to the latest version of ScreenConnect to remediate against reported vulnerabilities.

Today, ScreenConnect version 23.9.10.8817 was released containing a number of fixes to improve customer experience. It is always recommended to be on the latest version but 23.9.8 is the minimum version that remediated the reported vulnerabilities.

As part of this release, ConnectWise has removed license restrictions, so partners no longer under maintenance can upgrade to the latest version of ScreenConnect.

*\*Please see the February 27, 2024 security bulletin update that clarifies partners off maintenance can upgrade to 22.4.20001 (or a later eligible version) to receive a patch to CVE-2024-1709. To get the current 23.9.8 or later release, partners need to be on active maintenance.*

**February 20, 2024 update:**

**Indicators of compromise**Indicators of compromise (IOCs) look for malicious activity or threats. These indicators can be incorporated into your cybersecurity monitoring platform. They can help you stop a cyberattack that's in progress. Plus, you can use IOCs to find ways to detect and stop ransomware, malware, and other cyberthreats before they cause data breaches.

We've received notifications of suspicious activity that our incident response team has investigated. The following IP addresses were used by threat actors. We are making them available for protection and defense.

* 155.133.5.15
* 155.133.5.14
* 118.69.65.60

We will continue to update with any further information as it becomes available.

**Original Bulletin:**

**Summary**

Vulnerabilities were reported February 13, 2024, through our vulnerability disclosure channel via the ConnectWise Trust Center.

## FAQs

Frequently asked questions

What happened?

On February 13, 2024, an independent researcher ethically and responsibly reported two potential vulnerabilities using the ConnectWise vulnerability disclosure program through the ConnectWise Trust Center, including a potential critical vulnerability that would allow anonymous attackers to exploit an authentication bypass flaw to create admin accounts on publicly exposed instances. Essentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance.

What did ConnectWise do?

Once the vulnerability was validated on February 14, 2024, ConnectWise product security and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all cloud instances of ScreenConnect within 48 hours. We did so without requiring a version update. Then, we upgraded cloud instances to a later version for further hardening. As a result, partners within our hosted cloud environments were quickly secured against this critical vulnerability.

Following industry best practices for patching strategy, an official upgraded package was released on February 19, 2024, for all on-prem ScreenConnect partners, and a security bulletin was posted to the ConnectWise Trust Center strongly urging partners patch their on-prem instances of ScreenConnect. On the same day, ConnectWise initiated contact with CISA, and on February 22, CISA added CVE-2024-1709 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.

In addition, to provide timely information and support to our partners, we mobilized outreach communications through multiple channels, including security bulletins and advisories, partner emails, virtual events, and blogs. These communications emphasize the urgency to patch on-prem instances of ScreenConnect while providing our partners with the latest information, best practices, and support for this critical vulnerability.

![](/globalassets/media/blog/2024/02/screenconnect-response-timeline_4.png)

Who is at risk?

Anyone on a self-hosted instance running ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and prior.

Partners no longer under maintenance are eligible to install version 22.4.20001 at no additional cost, which will fix both vulnerabilities. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends updating to the latest release to get all the current security patches and therefore all partners should upgrade to 23.9.8 or higher as outlined in the upgrade path below.

**Upgrade ScreenConnect to a patched version**

1. To upgrade to version 23.9.8 or later, please note there is a specific upgrade path that must be followed:

1 → 2.5 → 3.1 → 4.4 → 5.4 → 19.2 → 22.8 → 23.3 → 23.9.8+

2. If you are not on maintenance and upgrading to 22.4.20001 (or your latest eligible version), please follow this specified upgrade path:

2.1 → 2.5 → 3.1 → 4.4 → 5.4 → 19.2 → 22.4.20001

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

What is the current status of the vulnerability?

**Cloud partners**
Cloud partners are remediated against both vulnerabilities reported on February 19 (CVE-2024-1709, CVE-2024-1708). No further action is required from any cloud partner (“screenconnect.com” cloud and “hostedrmm.com”), but we recommend to **trust but verify**. Take this opportunity as a reason to review your configuration, user accounts, and access logs to verify that everything aligns with what you would expect.

**On-premise partners**
A patch is available to you if you are a self-hosted or on-premise partner; we urge you to update your servers to version 23.9.8 immediately to apply the patch.

For instruction on updating to the newest release, please reference this doc: [Upgrade an on-premise installation - ConnectWise](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Upgrade_an_on-premises_installation)

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

If you possess enhanced Windows event logs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, thorough investigation should be conducted to identify any suspicious activity, including evidence of commands run from webshells or other indicators of compromise.

In the event of file anomalies or other indicators of compromise are identified, it is highly recommended to seek assistance from external response companies specializing in incident response and digital forensics. These companies possess the expertise necessary to effectively investigate and remediate security concerns.

Review file system, enhanced Windows event logs or EDR solutions for suspicious activity, such as webshell commands or other compromise indicators.

Seek assistance from specialized incident response and forensics firms if potential impacted files are identified.

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

How can partners protect themselves?

There are many things that a partner can do to protect themselves. In this situation, the most important thing you can do is **patch your instances immediately!**

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

What's the state of hosted/cloud partners?

ConnectWise cloud operations and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all ConnectWise hosted cloud instances of ScreenConnect within 48 hours of validation of the critical vulnerability. ConnectWise was able to mitigate the issue for partners in ConnectWise hosted environments without requiring a version update, because of the nature of the critical vulnerability. We next focused on creating a new build that patched both reported vulnerabilities and deployed it to partners in all cloud hosted environments (version 23.9.8). Cloud partners were not required to update agents to remediate the vulnerabilities. Partners on version 23.9.8 or higher are considered patched.

For cloud partners, do we need to make sure that all devices have been patched?

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. As a best practice, partners should update their agents after a server upgrade, but it is not required to mitigate this vulnerability. Check the ConnectWise University for more information on [reinstalling and upgrading an access agent](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Host_page/Reinstall_and_upgrade_an_access_agent).

Why was cloud patched first? Why was there a gap between patching the cloud and notifying on-prem partners?

Once the vulnerability was validated on February 14, 2024, ConnectWise cloud operations and engineering teams worked together to mitigate all ConnectWise hosted cloud instances of ScreenConnect. Due to the nature of the critical vulnerability, ConnectWise was able to mitigate the issue for partners in ConnectWise hosted environments quickly without requiring a version update. In tandem, we focused on creating new builds that patched both reported vulnerabilities for the current stable release and for versions dating back to 2022. The goal was to provide an upgrade path to a patched release to as many on-prem partners as possible. It took more time to update and QA multiple older builds for on-prem, whereas our cloud environments managed by ConnectWise were standardized to a smaller list of more current releases.

Version 23.9.10 was released, do I need to be on that version?

ScreenConnect version 23.9.10 is just the next release of ScreenConnect. The vulnerabilities were patched in versions 23.9.8 or higher. Partners on 23.9.8 or higher are considered patched for CVE-2024-1708 and CVE-2024-1709. New releases in the cloud will be returning to our normal rolling schedule moving forward.

What can I do if I suspect I have been compromised?

If you suspect your ScreenConnect software may be compromised, prioritize securing your systems. Follow your existing incident response playbook to isolate the affected servers and create backups to analyze later. Don't put those servers back online until they're thoroughly investigated, rebuilt, and secured with the latest patches.

Remember, a compromised ScreenConnect server might not be the only point of entry. Your incident response should encompass your entire system to identify and address any broader security vulnerabilities. We encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) .

I’m considering migrating/have migrated my on-prem server to ScreenConnect cloud since the security bulletin. What should I consider as part of a cloud migration?

Whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact before bringing any systems back online, upgrading your server, or migrating your server.  We encourage partners to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

Review the guide thoroughly and pay particular attention to the Internal Users on your on-prem server to verify that there are no unknown internal user accounts. Review file system, enhanced Windows event logs or EDR solutions for suspicious activity, such as web shell commands or other compromise indicators. Please seek assistance from specialized incident response and forensics firms if potential impacted files are identified.

Partners can then follow our instructions to migrate to the cloud: [Migrate to ScreenConnect Cloud from a Windows server - ConnectWise](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Migrate_to_ScreenConnect_Cloud_from_a_Windows_server). Post migration, partners should verify agent counts, uninstall agents, and decommission the on-premises server.  This should include removing DNS records and firewall rules allotted to the on premises ScreenConnect server.

Some of the partners are getting a license revoked error, even after upgrading their server to the latest version and rebooting. What do we do next?

Licenses were paused for servers that have checked in using an unpatched version. You will be able to upgrade to the current/patched versions, and if the license is eligible for the installed version, it will automatically be restored by the license server. However, the key would still need to be valid for the version you're using. If the key is not valid, it will stay as revoked, and you'd need to upgrade the key. To update upgrade your on-prem license, [click here](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/On-premises_licensing/Upgrade_an_on-premises_license).

Do my agents need to be upgraded? Were my agents affected by the vulnerability? Some security tools are flagging ScreenConnect agents as malware.

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. Partners have notified us that certain A/V vendors have flagged agents. These reports should be registered as false positives to your vendors, but we're also working with select vendors to fix the issue.

Why didn’t I receive an email?  Who at my company did receive an email?

We went to great lengths to contact partners and previous partners regarding this issue through multiple channels (e.g., email, Trust Center with RSS feed, blog, media/news outlets, channel advocates, social media, webinars, phone calls, community forums).

We’ve heard reports that messages went to junk or spam folders. To avoid this in the future, please set rules that allow ConnectWise communication to hit your primary inbox—add no-reply@connectwise.com to your safe sender list to ensure these important communications are delivered to your inbox.

In addition, please update your primary contact details by reaching out to your dedicated account manager. You can also ensure your email preferences are correctly configured in our online self-service [ConnectWise Profile and Preference Center](https://connectwise-privacy.my.onetrust.com/ui/#/preferences/multipage/login/91b8f372-b5d4-4ccb-9ce5-b413f14433d6) (learn more [here](/blog/company-updates/connectwise-profile-and-preference-center)).

To ensure you receive the latest security-related communications from ConnectWise, we highly recommend subscribing to the RSS feeds from our Trust Center to ensure you receive real-time notifications on the latest [security advisories](/company/trust/advisories) and [bulletins](/company/trust/security-bulletins).

If you have confirmed that your primary contact information is accurate and you are still not receiving emails from our system, we kindly request that you share the primary contact email with us for further investigation.

How do I get added to future security communications and important notices from ConnectWise?

We encourage you to update your primary contact details by reaching out to your dedicated account manager. You can also ensure your email preferences are correctly configured in our online self-service [ConnectWise Profile and Preference Center](https://connectwise-privacy.my.onetrust.com/ui/#/preferences/multipage/login/91b8f372-b5d4-4ccb-9ce5-b413f14433d6) (learn more [here](/blog/company-updates/connectwise-profile-and-preference-center)).

In addition, to avoid messages potentially going into a junk or spam folder, please set rules such as adding “no-reply@connectwise.com” to your safe sender list to ensure these important ConnectWise communications are delivered to the designated primary contact’s inbox.

And if you have not done so yet, we highly recommend subscribing to the RSS feeds from our Trust Center to ensure you receive real-time notifications on the latest [security advisories](/company/trust/advisories) and [bulletins](/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8).

Why was my cloud-hosted ScreenConnect showing a version older than 23.9.8 when the security advisory said we had already been updated?

We apologize for any confusion. For cloud-hosted partners, including RMM/Command partners, while we communicated that there was no action needed, many believed they were still vulnerable because their ScreenConnect was showing a version older than 23.9.8. We took action to remediate the vulnerability for all cloud partners, but because partners did not have the new version installed, they thought they were still vulnerable. We rolled out full version upgrades to resolve this. Again, we apologize for any confusion and inconvenience, or original message may have caused.

Why did my cloud-hosted ScreenConnect instance have downtime on February 21?

Some of our cloud-hosted partners (including RMM/Command partners) were concerned they were possibly compromised due to a brief downtime on February 21. This was due to an accelerated rollout of the formal patch version (23.9) to put us back on a proper release schedule. The average downtime for this was around 10 minutes.

How do I know what version of ScreenConnect I am eligible for?

Check your Status/Overview page and review the Version Check. Review the Latest Eligible Version row; this will detail the latest version of ScreenConnect that your license permits you to upgrade to.

![image6ytph.png](/contentassets/99bc3b7b471244bea825cd857da8844a/image6ytph.png)

Partners no longer under maintenance are eligible to install version 22.4.20001 at no additional cost, which will fix CVE-2024-1709, the critical vulnerability. However, this should be treated as an interim step. ConnectWise recommends updating to the latest release to get all the current security patches and therefore all partners should upgrade to 23.9.8 or higher using the upgrade path outlined above.

For instructions on how to renew your license, please [click here](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/On-premises_licensing/Upgrade_an_on-premises_license) or contact our sales team at screenconnectsales@connectwise.com.

What happens once I have patched to a remediated version?

**As a reminder and as part of the remediation process for on-prem partners—whether you have patched your server or still need to—it is critical to assess your systems for signs of impact while upgrading and before bringing any systems back online.**

Once you have patched your on-prem instance of ScreenConnect to the latest version, you should review users with access to ScreenConnect, remove any that are not recognized, change passwords, and enable MFA.

If you are using any extensions, please validate them and remove/add them again. Once all steps are completed restart the server.

To assist in the remediation and hardening process, we encourage you to review and follow the [ConnectWise ScreenConnect Remediation and Hardening Guide by Mandiant](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/connectwise-screenconnect-remediation-hardening-guide.pdf) for additional protection.

Do these vulnerabilities directly affect ScreenConnect clients?

ScreenConnect clients (agents) are not directly impacted by this issue. This is because the identified vulnerabilities involve an authentication bypass and path traversal issues within the server software itself (unpatched ScreenConnect instances version 23.9.7 and below), rather than any vulnerabilities within the client software that is installed on end-user devices. As a best practice, partners should update their agents after a server upgrade, but it is not required to mitigate the vulnerability. Check the ConnectWise University for more information on [reinstalling and upgrading an access agent](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/Get_started/Host_page/Reinstall_and_upgrade_an_access_agent).

Is there any connection between the ConnectWise ScreenConnect vulnerability disclosed on February 19, 2024, and the incident at Change Healthcare?

We are unaware of any confirmed connection between the ConnectWise ScreenConnect vulnerability disclosed on February 19, 2024, and the incident at Change Healthcare.

Our internal reviews have yet to identify Change Healthcare as a ScreenConnect customer, and none of our extensive network of MSPs have come forward with any information regarding their association with Change Healthcare.

You can read our official response to this question in its entirety [here](/company/press/releases/2024-02-28-connectwise-addresses-screenconnect-vulnerability-and-clarifies-connection-to-change-healthcare-incident).

What is ConnectWise doing to prevent vulnerabilities or exploits from happening again?

We maintain a robust "shift left" security program with continuous and ongoing investments, such as embedded security champions, threat modeling, code review, automated scanning and fuzzing, and both internal and external dedicated application penetration testing. However, even with all those best practices in place, vulnerabilities can still be discovered. This is true for the software industry, as exemplified by industry events like Patch Tuesday (also known as Update Tuesday), which has been around for over 20 years.

An additional focus is on continuously improving our vulnerability identification and response processes. A key component of this effort is our vulnerability disclosure program found on our [Trust Center](/company/trust). This program highlights our commitment to collaborating with independent researchers, industry organizations, partners, and the greater community across the globe in identifying weaknesses in any technology and helps ensure that reported vulnerabilities are handled ethically and responsibly, playing a crucial role in prioritization for remediation.

The recent vulnerabilities were reported through our vulnerability disclosure program and demonstrates the effectiveness of this program. We continue to focus on preventing vulnerabilities and how we respond, react, and keep you informed when they do occur.

To ensure you receive the latest security-related communications from ConnectWise, we highly recommend subscribing to the RSS feeds from our Trust Center to ensure you receive real-time notifications on the latest [security advisories](/company/trust/advisories) and [bulletins](/company/trust/security-bulletins).

How do I report a security incident?

If you have questions or need to report a security or privacy incident, please visit our [ConnectWise T](/company/trust)rust Center.

### @sfewer-r7 **[sfewer-r7](/sfewer-r7)** commented [Feb 21, 2024](#issue-2146748585) • edited by jheysel-r7 Loading

This ~~(draft)~~ pull request adds an exploit module for the recent authentication bypass vulnerability in ConnectWise ScreenConnect. ~~(No CVE has been assigned at this time.)~~

* Vendor Advisory: <https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8>
* Public PoC: <https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/connectwise-screenconnect_auth-bypass-add-user-poc>
* Technical Analysis: <https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass>

RCE is achieved by leveraging the vulnerability to create a new admin account, and then using these creds to upload an extension (i.e. a plugin) that hosts a Metasploit payload. Currently only `ARCH_CMD` payloads are supported.

Update 1: Support for `ARCH_X64` and `ARCH_X86` payloads has been added, these payloads are executed in the `ScreenConnect.Service.exe` process.

Update 2: Added support for a Linux command target.

Update 3: Move module to the "multi" directory as it now supports a Linux target. Remove `ARCH_X86` as [ScreenConnect only supports](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Server_system_requirements?mt-learningpath=control_on_prem_install) x64 and we don't want to inject x86 shellcode into an x64 process.

## To-Do

* Documentation
* Investigate more payload support

We have a library function that should in theory be able to handle printable characters

```
    cmd = Msf::Post::Windows.escape_cmd_literal(cmd, spaces: false)

```

Looks like `escape_cmd_literal` (shown below) will escape these chars `^ & < > |`  but the above c# code needs to escape a `\` to become `\\`, so I will leave this as it is, thanks.

```
  def self.escape_cmd_literal(string, spaces:)
    string = string.dup
    %w[ ^ & < > | " ].each { |char| string.gsub!(char, "^#{char}") }
    string.gsub!(' ', '" "') if spaces
    string
  end
```

I think this *might* be fine, but we have a library for generating random vars with rex random identifier

```
generator = Rex::RandomIdentifier::Generator.new({ language: :jsp })

```

Looks like we don't have `csharp` or similar as a language though - you can supply your own language keywords

If there is an issue with the potential of generating random strings that are accidentally language keywords here, we can just supply forbidden words and if there's anything to fix here we can circle back to adding the keyword list into rex random identifier itself later:

```
generator = Rex::RandomIdentifier::Generator.new({ forbidden: ['interface', 'class', 'etc' ] })

```

| From a quick test, the path appears to be case insensitive - what would you think of randomizing the case on `SeTuPcoNNECt.aspx`?  Hi [@iagox86](https://github.com/iagox86) - I just tested this on a Windows target and you are correct, the exploit still works if you change the case of `SetupWizard.aspx` . However the exploit fails against a Linux target if you change the case.  As I want to support a Linux target too, and you don't know the platform in advance, I will probably leave it as it is. |

| ...although as we can get a version number, and we know Linux support stopped at 20.3.31734.7751, then any version above this must be Windows, so there is scope to leverage this fact when targeting certain version numbers.  I will have a think and see if this could be reasonably implemented. |

| You could also try randomized then not randomized.  But that doesn't really seem worth it, honestly. The gain is too marginal, although you'll almost certainly bypass a lot of rules if you randomize (I specifically did case insensitive checking in our tag, but others probably don't) |

The advantage is you can use the check routine to confirm vulnerability, but you also know what exploit target to choose based on the platform (Target 0 and 1 for Windows, and 2 for Linux).  ``` msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > set RHOST 192.168.86.50 RHOST => 192.168.86.50 msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > check [*] 192.168.86.50:8040 - The target appears to be vulnerable.

| So my team and I managed to test this Module on a vulnerable version of screenconnect, and this worked perfectly! So thanks for the module guys!  But something that might be more helpful, my team managed to test and confirm this module to run on [ScreenConnect\_21.14.5924.8013\_Release](https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.14.5924.8013_Release.msi). The link in your documentation for testing is no longer up, and it looks like they might have patched all of their recent versions of 23.\*.

In the off chance the user wants to specify a username and password we should try and support that use case by registering the datastore option and making the default values random strings.

This example the username and password will be the same random strings across multiple module runs:

[metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/local/f5\_create\_user.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/cf172d22c88806181cae699b9c9e598994abf360/modules/exploits/linux/local/f5_create_user.rb#L51-L52)

Lines 51 to 52
in
[cf172d2](/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/cf172d22c88806181cae699b9c9e598994abf360)

|  | OptString.new('USERNAME', [true, 'Username to create (default: random)', Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(8)]), |
| --- | --- |
|  | OptString.new('PASSWORD', [true, 'Password for the new user (default: random)', Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(12)]), |

Or you can go this route where you get a different set of random strings each module run:

[metasploit-framework/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp\_woocommerce\_payments\_add\_user.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/d6911f6b13054cfb2f83be6077ed9a27598b3e8c/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_woocommerce_payments_add_user.rb#L95-L98)

in
[d6911f6](/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/d6911f6b13054cfb2f83be6077ed9a27598b3e8c)

|  | username = datastore['USERNAME'] |
| --- | --- |
|  | if datastore['USERNAME'].blank? |
|  | username = Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(5..20) |
|  | end |

Not a blocker - I'm not sure if we prefer randomizing strings like these or if we'd want to use the `Faker` library.

I also noticed lower down when you create `manifest_data`, the fields `Name`, `Author` and `Description` all get randomized. We could use the `Faker` library to generate a random name for the `Author` field but seems slightly futile if `Name` and `Description` will both be random. Just thinking out loud.

Suggested change

|  | 'ctl00$Main$wizard$emailBox' => "#{admin\_username}@#{Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alpha\_lower(8)}.#{Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alpha\_lower(3)}", |
| --- | --- |

This generates a random UUID using Ruby's PRNG `Random` class.

Suggested change

| --- | --- |
|  | plugin\_guid = Faker::Internet.uuid |

Edit: To specify it does not return a uuid wrapped in curly braces. If this suggestion is accepted the # NOTE above should also be removed.

I've been unable to successfully complete the exploit due to the following error: "Unexpected reply after attempting to login with admin credentials." Any troubleshooting ideas?

The only difference I can find in my approach is that I have not been able to login to <http://127.0.0.1:8040/> because I can't find the trial license key to paste. However, I am successfully logged into the <https://username.screenconnect.com/Host#Support/All%20Sessions> console. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

### **[sfewer-r7](/sfewer-r7)** commented [Feb 29, 2024](#issuecomment-1970727946)

| Hi [@canders-crwd](https://github.com/canders-crwd)  I tested `ScreenConnect_23.8.8.8818_Release.msi` (SHA1: `28d2ef64957a9034f694b93789e947e0b5b04201`) and as per [@rad10](https://github.com/rad10) comment above, it appears ConnectWise have backported the patch to 23.\* versions, so exploitation fails if you are targeting an install from these backported versions:  ``` msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > exploit  [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.86.42:4444  [*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable) [+] The target appears to be vulnerable. ConnectWise ScreenConnect 23.8.8 running on Windows. [-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Unexpected reply when initiating setup wizard. [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.  ```  However I think what you are seeing is slightly different from this, your console output shows that an account is created but cannot be used. I expect this is due to the target server being unlicensed. |

# ConnectWise ScreenConnect: Authentication Bypass Deep Dive

James Horseman  |  February 21, 2024  |  [Attack Blogs](https://www.horizon3.ai/category/attack-research/attack-blogs/)
# Introduction

On February 19, 2023, ConnectWise published a [security advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8)for their ScreenConnect remote management tool. In the advisory, they describe two vulnerabilities, an authentication bypass with CVSS 10.0 and a path traversal with CVSS 8.4 (both currently without assigned CVE IDs). In this post we will dive into the technical details of the authentication bypass. You can view our POC [here](https://github.com/horizon3ai/SecureConnect-Auth-Bypass).

Update: On February 21, 2023, the authentication bypass vulnerability was assigned as CVE-2024-1709 and added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog.

# Patch Diffing

Comparing versions 23.9.7.8804 and 23.9.8.8811, we find a small update to `SetupWizard.aspx`. We see that a check was added to make sure that the initial application setup has not been completed if a user it trying to access the SetupWizard. The SetupWizard is responsible for creating an initial user and password, so it makes sense that this page should be locked down after an initial user has been created.

[![SetupWizard.aspx](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SetupWizard.png)](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SetupWizard.png)

Figure 1. SetupWizard.aspx

# The Vulnerability

There is a HTTP request filter in `SetupModule.cs` that has two responsibilities:

* If the application hasn’t been setup, redirect all requests to `SetupWizard.aspx`
* If the application has been setup, deny any requests to `SetupWizard.aspx` or redirect to `Administration.aspx`

[![SetupModule.cs OnBeginRequest](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-12.36.46 PM.png)](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-12.36.46%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Figure 2. SetupModule.cs OnBeginRequest

However, there is an issue with how this code checks if the request URL is `SetupPage.aspx`. The use of `string.Equals` checks for exact equality, so a URL like `<app_url>/SetupWizard.aspx` will match. However, there are other URLs that resolve to `SetupWizard.aspx` that don’t match. If we simply add a forward slash to the end of the URL (`<app_url>/SetupWizard.aspx/`) we get access to the setup wizard, even after the application is already setup.

[![SetupWizard.aspx](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-3.27.35 PM.png)](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-3.27.35%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Figure 3. SetupWizard.aspx

We can observe the differences in responses using Burp Suite. Notice the request path `/SetupWizard.aspx` responds with a 302, but the malicious path `/SetupWizard.aspx/` responds with a 200.

[![SetupWizard.aspx responses](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-12.55.52 PM.png)](https://www.horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-12.55.52%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Figure 4. SetupWizard.aspx responses

# Indicators of Compromise

The application’s Admin -> Audit page displays a list of recent login attempts along with the IP address. You can check this page for any unrecognized users or IP addresses.

As soon as we had sufficient information, we shared it with GreyNoise for which they developed a tag. Check out their tag here: <https://viz.greynoise.io/tags/connectwise-screenconnect-auth-bypass-rce-attempt?days=1>

# Summary

This vulnerability allows an attacker to create their own administrative user on the ScreenConnect server, giving them full control over the server. This vulnerability follows a theme of other recent vulnerabilities that allow attackers to reinitialize applications or create initial users after setup. See our recent writeup for a [CVE-2024-0204](https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2024-0204) as an example.

Unfortunately, this vulnerability has not yet been assigned a CVE. Users of ConnectWise ScreenConnect should patch immediately to prevent attackers from leveraging this vulnerability.

**UPDATE:**Â [Read our full analysis of CVE-2024-1709 & CVE-2024-1708 and detection guidance here.](https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass)

**UPDATE:** We have proactively deployed a temporary hotfix to over 1000 vulnerable systems managed by Huntress. It's crucial people still update to the latest official version ASAP. During research and creation of a Proof-of-Concept exploit to validate the vulnerability, Huntress identified a way to temporarily hot-fix vulnerable systems while administrators work to patch their systems.

UPDATE: Â [Detection guidance from Huntress has been issued](/blog/detection-guidance-for-connectwise-cwe-288-2).

Huntress security researchers successfully created and validated a proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerabilities referenced to in the latest February 19 [ConnectWise ScreenConnect advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8).Â

1. CWE-288 âAuthentication bypass using an alternate path or channel,â base score of 10, and
2. CWE-22 âImproper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (âpath traversalâ),â base score of 8.4

The ConnectWise article indicates the severity as â**criticalâ*vulnerabilities that could allow the ability to execute remote code or directly impact confidential data or critical systems.â***Â

Huntress is in complete agreement with this assessment. They state there is no knowledge of any in-the-wild exploitation, and for this reason, we will not yet share any further details on this threat.

As of 07:00 AM EST, over 8,800 servers are shown as running a vulnerable version on the Censys.io platform.

For Cloud users of ScreenConnect, no action is required on your partâcloud instances have been automatically updated to the latest secure version.

For on-premise users, **we offer our strongest recommendation to patch and update to ScreenConnect version 23.9.8 immediately.Â**

We encourage customers and partners to reach out if they need assistance. If you are not currently using Huntress EDR, sign up for a [free trial](https://www.huntress.com/start-trial), and Huntress will monitor for any related activity.

On February 19, 2024, ConnectWise published a [security advisory](https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8) for ScreenConnect version 23.9.8, referencing two vulnerabilities and software weaknesses. The same day, Huntress researchers worked to understand this threat and successfully recreated a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating its impact.

This write-up will discuss our analysis efforts and the technical details behind this attack, which weâre coining as âSlashAndGrab.â

The ConnectWise advisory indicated that in all versions of ScreenConnect below 23.9.8 there were two vulnerabilities:

1. **CVE-2024-1709**: Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288)
2. **CVE-2024-1708**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (âpath traversalâ)Â (CWE-22)

The first vulnerability was disclosed with a critical base CVSS scoring of 10, the highest possible severity. The authentication bypass would ultimately open the door for the second vulnerability.

ConnectWise made a patch available and expressed that all **on-premise** versions of ScreenConnect 23.9.7 and below must be updated immediatelyâcloud instances were already automatically patched.

At the time of release, the ConnectWise advisory was very sparse on technical details. There was not much information available as to what these vulnerabilities really consisted of, how they might be taken advantage of, or any other threat intelligence or indicators of compromise to hunt for.

Once we recreated the exploit and attack chain, we came to the same conclusion: there should not be public details about the vulnerability until there had been adequate time for the industry to patch. It would be too dangerous for this information to be readily available to threat actors.

But, with other vendors now publicly sharing the proof-of-concept exploit, the cat is out of the bag. We now feel that sharing our analysis shares no more threat than what is already available. So, weâre ready to spill the beans.

**The âexploitâ is trivial and embarrassingly easy.**

Below is a video demonstration of our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, which performs the simple authentication bypass but takes it a step further to showcase remote code execution.

## **Our Analysis**

When the Huntress team was made aware of the ConnectWise advisory, our team began to dig into what changes were made in the patch that could help explain what these vulnerabilities were.

We could simply look for the differences between code present in the new, patched version, and the previous, unpatched version. Creating a local testing environment for both of these states of the ScreenConnect software, we could easily see the delta that might clue us into the potential exploit.

We observed that these files differed:Â

## **CVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass**

Most of these changes observed in the new version were binary files, which require decompilation to compare; however, [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] is a text file. When looking at the differences in this file, it immediately looked promising:

In the newest update, we can see there is a new check to ensure that the instance is set up before allowing the user to use the setup wizard. This piqued our interest as, at face value, version 23.9.7 already blocked access to the setup wizard after authentication. Looking closer into [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.SetupModule**[.highlight] inside of [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Web.dll**[.highlight] sheds more light on the exploitation path.Â

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d558784370931755195cac_VOF-6GVi8aXEkUnXg6QMpJKg-y8tK8X8wOzr8vpiZr_zsnrQ1-UW6sUxmPiI-pnhlH9p0AaCEsGVqrqIPEEjzdtn1RgshZH8XoaYV118B5SJaZlF4D_KSNMJszRFzGhxjQnjBtSdwnhn786MYYrs8PI.png)

In previous versions of ScreenConnect, this handler was registered for the [.highlight]**OnBeginRequest**[.highlight] event, while in 28.9.8 it is registered for the [.highlight]**OnPostMapRequestHandler**[.highlight] event. This was seemingly done so that the [.highlight]**context.Handler**[.highlight] field will be populated. A new check is added to validate if the resolved HTTP handler implements the new [.highlight]**ISetupHandler**[.highlight] interface whereas the old code simply checked that [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] string matched â[.highlight]**/SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight]â. This change implies that there was some way to bypass the string comparison of [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] in previous versions. **If the request path does not match â[.highlight]/SetupWizard.aspx[.highlight],â then the setup wizard will be allowed regardless of the setup state of the instance.**

This would normally not be exploitable, but .Net has weird functionality that allows URL path components after a mapped legitimate URL to be passed along to the application. This information is exposed in [.highlight]**Request.FilePath**[.highlight], [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight] and [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight]. For example, if there is a legitimate path â[.highlight]**/something.aspx**[.highlight]â, then .Net will allow the user to request â[.highlight]**/something.aspx/anythingelse**[.highlight]â and will pass along the trailing bit after the file path via the [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight]. However, [.highlight]**Request.Path**[.highlight] always contains *both*[.highlight]**Request.FilePath**[.highlight] *and* [.highlight]**Request.PathInfo**[.highlight] per [MSDN documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httprequest.path?view=netframework-4.8.1):

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d5587895aab08ada261523_5o-p55Z5UH6spdxDIaiuiwTL9pVNZXaiwYCUp_mSsxn5z2xDpK5Gw_o-o3ftPbQ7VWbSHYopNTqSimVy3lDSLfLGwHVzAfoGW9N1HJWh2dZFb5cpxoqI6tiihUgtb81vYtMTJUT6-f3byU3q8g8krbU.png)

Putting this together, it means we can simply request â[.highlight]**/SetupWizard.aspx/literallyanything**[.highlight]â and we should be allowed to access the setup wizard on already-configured ScreenConnect instances.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d55879cb2af12170f04f97_Es0JkQJKuG-5DjiEiOOfDGEQKAHS8dBwPDRCXqlN72QDQ733637nICPRUkYkJ6TA3JyCaZFTEw5a6dezq4jWGGXwyhFfOG4mpm40MNYMWR7rH-OXO8tepHjgTJbWCQUwRWt0TQ79MJbSTcioXS5mWkQ.png)

The setup wizard is responsible for setting up the initial administrative user and installing a license on the system during initial setup. The user creation portion of this setup happens immediately after clicking the âNextâ button on the setup page, so there is no need to complete the setup wizard fully to exploit the system (i.e. you do not need to replace or have access to a valid license key). **Completing this step will completely overwrite the internal user database. All other local users will be deleted aside from the user you specify in the setup wizard.**

Once you have administrative access to a compromised instance, it is trivial to create and upload a malicious ScreenConnect extension to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is not a vulnerability, but a feature of ScreenConnect, which allows an administrator to create extensions that execute .Net code as [.highlight]**SYSTEM**[.highlight] on the ScreenConnect server.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d5587816961aa1bccf46e7_bCQT10Rn49nJ0hfB4GAkkb3XEvxwdyo-gxNYZzVtE5K9v1nQmjWbCW6OHPdS9wTnTRGJ0KpH_LH0d1YY_Ignr_zFKfRs9BqM1SpJfeox48WDpKIdDgOhJ6d_n947AQK1p4PqR0fxL7-LawYoIVNYcys.png)
## **CVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal**

The second vulnerability referenced in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect advisory presents a risk of ZipSlip attacks. We observed changes to [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Core.dll**[.highlight]:

and [.highlight]**ScreenConnect.Server.dll**[.highlight]:Â

This adds new function arguments to strictly handle file paths when extracting content from a ZIP file. Looking through the code base, we can see these utility functions only seem to be used when handling ScreenConnect extensions. Prior to this patch, a malicious extension could potentially write files anywhere within [.highlight]**C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Extensions**[.highlight] instead of being properly restricted to their extension subdirectory.

While this is another vulnerability fixed in version [.highlight]**23.9.8**[.highlight] that could lead to remote code execution in certain conditions, it relies upon having administrative credentials and access to be able to use the Extensions functionality. This capability is âunlockedâ by the authentication bypass, but is less severe on its own.

In our recreated proof-of-concept exploit, taking advantage of this potential ZipSlip attack vector was not necessary; after gaining administrator access with the authentication bypass, it was already possible to run arbitrary code with the typical Extensions feature set. The primary difference being that malicious code written using this vulnerability does not necessarily need an installed extension to execute. This means that it may go unnoticed more easily within your environment. Any [.highlight]**.aspx**[.highlight] or [.highlight]**.ashx**[.highlight] files within the root of [.highlight]**C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Extensions\**[.highlight] are likely malicious artifacts. ScreenConnect does not place any files within this directory normally.

## **Detection Guidance**

While researching the above vulnerabilities, Huntress identified Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) and developed a set of detections that can be used to notify ScreenConnect users of potential malicious activity.

As a reminder, per Huntressâs previous [post](https://www.huntress.com/blog/detection-guidance-for-connectwise-cwe-288-2), the below listed SIGMA rules that leverage [Windows Event ID 4663](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4663) requires that the Advanced Auditing policy be configured, and an appropriate SACL applied to the directory. Please refer to the previous blog post for how to generate this event.Â Â

## **CVE-2024-1709 - Authentication Bypass**

While replicating the Authentication Bypass exploit, Huntress observed IIS logs for the malicious [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] URL path, which can be used as an indicator of compromise:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65d55878e0bce79d5469d328_3UiSOzyngYMkZ2TqaT488ZZgGjEPTdpHFOHkPvUScU7z6Jt6uD9hGkaoWVJ8fI1IIO0FNuU_UaNbwPZ6Um9h1WGtQhkSWMxcosQz0KFHj3JgrbVAQ7sIzu8kQ-DuLMcQIS-Cj1aTMKfDCygOuW_R_rk.png)

The following Sigma rule will detect requests made to [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] with a trailing path segment. This behavior is never legitimate, and should clearly indicate malicious intent if observed in the wild.

After accessing the Setup Wizard, an attacker will input new credentials to gain access to Screen Connect. Doing so will write a new user database to a temporary XML file. The following Sigma rule can be used to detect the ScreenConnect server writing to a temporary XML file on the server. While this may be an indicator of compromise, this activity is known to also be observed when legitimately modifying local users or their permissions in ScreenConnect, so there is a non-zero false positive rate.

The following YARA rule is similar to the IIS log Sigma rule given above. It will detect IIS log entries that reference [.highlight]**SetupWizard.aspx**[.highlight] with a trailing path component. As mentioned previously, a trailing path component on this file is always associated with malicious activity.

## **CVE-2024-1708 - Path Traversal**

The path traversal exploit allows attackers to write files within the root of the [.highlight]**App\_Extensions**[.highlight] directory. The following Sigma rule should alert on file modifications at the root of the [.highlight]**App\_Extensions**[.highlight] directory while excluding legitimate modifications to extensions themselves.Â
