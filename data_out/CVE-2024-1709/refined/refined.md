Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided documents:

**CVE-2024-1709: Authentication Bypass in ConnectWise ScreenConnect**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper check within the `SetupModule.cs` file when handling requests to `SetupWizard.aspx`. The application uses `string.Equals` which checks for exact equality, but does not account for path variations. It can be bypassed by adding a trailing forward slash `/` to the URL, e.g., `/SetupWizard.aspx/`. This bypass allows access to the setup wizard even after the initial setup is complete.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-288:** Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel.
    *   The use of `string.Equals` for URL path comparison instead of a more robust method.
    *   Failure to normalize or validate URL paths before processing.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
    *   An attacker can create a new administrative user account, gaining full control over the ScreenConnect server.
    *   The exploit overwrites the internal user database deleting all other local accounts.
    *   After gaining administrator access, attackers can upload malicious extensions, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is an HTTP request to a vulnerable ScreenConnect server with the URL path `/SetupWizard.aspx/` or similar variation containing trailing slashes or path components.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the ScreenConnect server.
    *   No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   Minimal technical knowledge is required for exploitation.

**CVE-2024-1708: Path Traversal in ConnectWise ScreenConnect**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability exists due to insufficient checks when extracting files from ZIP archives.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-22:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (Path Traversal).
    *   Lack of proper sanitization and validation of file paths during ZIP extraction.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Allows an attacker with administrative privileges to write files outside the intended extension subdirectories within`C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect\App\_Extensions`.
    *  Can be used to achieve RCE by dropping a .ashx or .aspx web shell in the extensions directory, but requires administrative access to ScreenConnect.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious extension uploaded to the server can exploit the path traversal.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Administrative privileges are required to upload extensions, which are typically obtained after exploiting CVE-2024-1709.

**Additional Technical Details and Observations:**

*   **Metasploit Module:** A Metasploit module was developed to exploit this vulnerability (CVE-2024-1709), enabling remote code execution. This module performs the following steps:
    1.  Bypasses authentication to create a new administrative user.
    2.  Uses the newly created account to upload a malicious extension containing a Metasploit payload.
    3.  Executes the payload in the `ScreenConnect.Service.exe` process or as a Linux command.
*   **File Artifacts:**
    *   Exploitation creates a temporary XML file containing user database information during account creation.
    *   Malicious extensions are created in the Extensions directory.
    *   IIS logs show requests to `/SetupWizard.aspx/` or similar paths.
    *  A `<random_value>.xml` file is created in  `C:\Windows\Temp\ScreenConnect\23.9.7.8804\` but immediately removed after creation. This file can be recovered via disk forensics.
*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   Windows Event ID 4663, configured with SACL on specific directories and log analysis can reveal file modifications related to the exploit.
    *   SIEM systems can be configured to detect the above logs and events.
    *   YARA rules can detect the aforementioned malicious log activity.
    *   Monitoring the user accounts within ScreenConnect for newly created administrative accounts.
*   **Patching:** ConnectWise released version 23.9.8 to address these vulnerabilities and provided a patch for 22.4.20001 as an interim solution, strongly encouraging on-premise users to upgrade their ScreenConnect servers. Cloud instances were automatically patched by ConnectWise.
*   **Exploitation in the wild:** While ConnectWise initially stated there was no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation, reports and evidence quickly emerged confirming that it was being actively exploited.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The authentication bypass (CVE-2024-1709) is the critical vulnerability, which can be exploited easily.
*   The path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-1708) becomes exploitable after successful exploitation of the authentication bypass.
*   Immediate patching is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, as they lead to RCE and complete control of the server.
*   Attackers can chain the exploit with other known ScreenConnect vulnerabilities for persistence and further access on an environment.
*   Detection should focus on monitoring access to the SetupWizard and abnormal file modifications within the ScreenConnect directories and the web server logs.
