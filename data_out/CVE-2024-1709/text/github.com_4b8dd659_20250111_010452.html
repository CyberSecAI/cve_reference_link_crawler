### @sfewer-r7 **[sfewer-r7](/sfewer-r7)** commented [Feb 21, 2024](#issue-2146748585) • edited by jheysel-r7 Loading

This ~~(draft)~~ pull request adds an exploit module for the recent authentication bypass vulnerability in ConnectWise ScreenConnect. ~~(No CVE has been assigned at this time.)~~

* Vendor Advisory: <https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/connectwise-screenconnect-23.9.8>
* Public PoC: <https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/connectwise-screenconnect_auth-bypass-add-user-poc>
* Technical Analysis: <https://www.huntress.com/blog/a-catastrophe-for-control-understanding-the-screenconnect-authentication-bypass>

RCE is achieved by leveraging the vulnerability to create a new admin account, and then using these creds to upload an extension (i.e. a plugin) that hosts a Metasploit payload. Currently only `ARCH_CMD` payloads are supported.

Update 1: Support for `ARCH_X64` and `ARCH_X86` payloads has been added, these payloads are executed in the `ScreenConnect.Service.exe` process.

Update 2: Added support for a Linux command target.

Update 3: Move module to the "multi" directory as it now supports a Linux target. Remove `ARCH_X86` as [ScreenConnect only supports](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_Documentation/On-premises/Get_started_with_ConnectWise_ScreenConnect_On-Premise/Server_system_requirements?mt-learningpath=control_on_prem_install) x64 and we don't want to inject x86 shellcode into an x64 process.

## To-Do

* Documentation
* Investigate more payload support

## Usage

We have a library function that should in theory be able to handle printable characters

```
    cmd = Msf::Post::Windows.escape_cmd_literal(cmd, spaces: false)

Looks like `escape_cmd_literal` (shown below) will escape these chars `^ & < > |`  but the above c# code needs to escape a `\` to become `\\`, so I will leave this as it is, thanks.

```
  def self.escape_cmd_literal(string, spaces:)
    string = string.dup
    %w[ ^ & < > | " ].each { |char| string.gsub!(char, "^#{char}") }
    string.gsub!(' ', '" "') if spaces
    string
  end
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

I think this *might* be fine, but we have a library for generating random vars with rex random identifier

```
generator = Rex::RandomIdentifier::Generator.new({ language: :jsp })

```

Looks like we don't have `csharp` or similar as a language though - you can supply your own language keywords

If there is an issue with the potential of generating random strings that are accidentally language keywords here, we can just supply forbidden words and if there's anything to fix here we can circle back to adding the keyword list into rex random identifier itself later:

```
generator = Rex::RandomIdentifier::Generator.new({ forbidden: ['interface', 'class', 'etc' ] })

```

I implemented this via [2839683](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/18870/commits/2839683af509726f86e4b13aae38b4978dd98b71) by using `Rex::RandomIdentifier::Generator` and a `forbidden` list as you suggested, thanks!

| From a quick test, the path appears to be case insensitive - what would you think of randomizing the case on `SeTuPcoNNECt.aspx`?  Hi [@iagox86](https://github.com/iagox86) - I just tested this on a Windows target and you are correct, the exploit still works if you change the case of `SetupWizard.aspx` . However the exploit fails against a Linux target if you change the case.  As I want to support a Linux target too, and you don't know the platform in advance, I will probably leave it as it is. |

| ...although as we can get a version number, and we know Linux support stopped at 20.3.31734.7751, then any version above this must be Windows, so there is scope to leverage this fact when targeting certain version numbers.  I will have a think and see if this could be reasonably implemented. |

| You could also try randomized then not randomized.  But that doesn't really seem worth it, honestly. The gain is too marginal, although you'll almost certainly bypass a lot of rules if you randomize (I specifically did case insensitive checking in our tag, but others probably don't) |

The advantage is you can use the check routine to confirm vulnerability, but you also know what exploit target to choose based on the platform (Target 0 and 1 for Windows, and 2 for Linux).  ``` msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > set RHOST 192.168.86.50 RHOST => 192.168.86.50 msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > check [*] 192.168.86.50:8040 - The target appears to be vulnerable.

| So my team and I managed to test this Module on a vulnerable version of screenconnect, and this worked perfectly! So thanks for the module guys!  But something that might be more helpful, my team managed to test and confirm this module to run on [ScreenConnect\_21.14.5924.8013\_Release](https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.14.5924.8013_Release.msi). The link in your documentation for testing is no longer up, and it looks like they might have patched all of their recent versions of 23.\*.

In the off chance the user wants to specify a username and password we should try and support that use case by registering the datastore option and making the default values random strings.

This example the username and password will be the same random strings across multiple module runs:

[metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/local/f5\_create\_user.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/cf172d22c88806181cae699b9c9e598994abf360/modules/exploits/linux/local/f5_create_user.rb#L51-L52)

Lines 51 to 52
in
[cf172d2](/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/cf172d22c88806181cae699b9c9e598994abf360)

|  | OptString.new('USERNAME', [true, 'Username to create (default: random)', Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(8)]), |
| --- | --- |
|  | OptString.new('PASSWORD', [true, 'Password for the new user (default: random)', Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(12)]), |

Or you can go this route where you get a different set of random strings each module run:

[metasploit-framework/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp\_woocommerce\_payments\_add\_user.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/d6911f6b13054cfb2f83be6077ed9a27598b3e8c/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_woocommerce_payments_add_user.rb#L95-L98)

in

|  | username = datastore['USERNAME'] |
| --- | --- |
|  | if datastore['USERNAME'].blank? |
|  | username = Rex::Text.rand\_text\_alphanumeric(5..20) |
|  | end |

Not a blocker - I'm not sure if we prefer randomizing strings like these or if we'd want to use the `Faker` library.

I also noticed lower down when you create `manifest_data`, the fields `Name`, `Author` and `Description` all get randomized. We could use the `Faker` library to generate a random name for the `Author` field but seems slightly futile if `Name` and `Description` will both be random. Just thinking out loud.

Suggested change

I've been unable to successfully complete the exploit due to the following error: "Unexpected reply after attempting to login with admin credentials." Any troubleshooting ideas?

The only difference I can find in my approach is that I have not been able to login to <http://127.0.0.1:8040/> because I can't find the trial license key to paste. However, I am successfully logged into the <https://username.screenconnect.com/Host#Support/All%20Sessions> console. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

| Hi [@canders-crwd](https://github.com/canders-crwd)  I tested `ScreenConnect_23.8.8.8818_Release.msi` (SHA1: `28d2ef64957a9034f694b93789e947e0b5b04201`) and as per [@rad10](https://github.com/rad10) comment above, it appears ConnectWise have backported the patch to 23.\* versions, so exploitation fails if you are targeting an install from these backported versions:  ``` msf6 exploit(multi/http/connectwise_screenconnect_rce_cve_2024_1709) > exploit  [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.86.42:4444  [*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable) [+] The target appears to be vulnerable. ConnectWise ScreenConnect 23.8.8 running on Windows. [-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unexpected-reply: Unexpected reply when initiating setup wizard. [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.  ```  However I think what you are seeing is slightly different from this, your console output shows that an account is created but cannot be used. I expect this is due to the target server being unlicensed. |
