Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **Improper Access Control** within AVEVA Edge software. Specifically, it allows unauthenticated arbitrary commands to be executed within the security context of the `StADOSvr.exe` process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** The software fails to properly restrict access to critical functions, enabling unauthorized command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the user account under which the AVEVA Edge runtime is running. In most cases this will be a standard-privileged user. However, if the runtime is configured to run under a high-privileged service account, this could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the system, including the ability to read sensitive information, modify system data and disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network (AV:N).
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** Exploitation requires a low level of effort (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication or user credentials to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable system over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions the affected products: AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1, AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 w/ HF 2020.2.00.40, AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 and all prior versions (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio)
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The advisory recommends updating to AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP2 and restricting access to port TCP/3997.
