| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2004949#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-09-16 13:37:43 UTC  ``` OpenVPN's use of Netfilter makes it susceptible to several attacks that can cause denial-of-service, deanonymization of clients, or redirection of a victim client connection to an attacker controlled server.

Dunno what to say.  Hi Wade, I have two questions I am hoping you can answer. First, what do you think are more common openvpn nat scenarios? Second, what is I:H?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2004949#c13)  Wade Mealing    2023-08-29 13:07:46 UTC  ```  > First, what do you think are more common openvpn nat scenarios?   Commercial NAT systems (used to be cisco pix firewalls, etc).  There was also a configuration that I'm aware of a private network on "the cloud" which had VPN connections out to another cloud and routed between them.  > I:H  Apologies, its been a while.  IIRC it was because you had the ability also modify data on the server to attack the client, it might even be a little more.  I have since changed positions in Red Hat and didnt keep notes on this, sorry about that.   ``` |  |
