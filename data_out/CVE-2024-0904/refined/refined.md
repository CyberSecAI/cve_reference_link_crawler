- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape certain settings, which allows for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings (specifically the license field).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator.
