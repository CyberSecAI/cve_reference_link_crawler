## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Fancy Product Designer < 6.1.81 - Admin+ Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fpd\_genius
2. In the license field, add the PoC: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Click "Register License" and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
