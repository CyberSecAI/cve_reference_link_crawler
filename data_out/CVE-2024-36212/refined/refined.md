The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). This document includes CVE-2024-36212 which is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**CVE-2024-36212 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the system.
*   **Weaknesses:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session, potentially allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network. An attacker would need to inject the malicious script through a vulnerable feature which will be stored within AEM. When a victim views the content where the malicious script is stored, it will execute in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A low-privileged attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script via a vulnerable feature. The exploitation requires a victim to interact with the malicious content, hence user interaction is required.

The document provides a comprehensive list of other vulnerabilities affecting AEM, along with their respective CVE IDs, severity ratings, and CVSS scores. It also mentions dependencies with vulnerabilities and provides acknowledgments to researchers who reported the issues.
