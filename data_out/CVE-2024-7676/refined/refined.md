  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'id' parameter received via the GET method in the Master.php file is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any sanitization or filtering.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being directly used in SQL queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to read arbitrary database information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'id' parameter in the URL when accessing the Master.php file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request with the vulnerable parameter and needs to be logged into the admin panel."
