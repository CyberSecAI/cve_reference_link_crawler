Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in some REST endpoints of the Visual Portfolio WordPress plugin. This allows unauthenticated users to access and manipulate certain plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of authorization checks in specific REST API endpoints. This allows any user, even those not logged in, to access and modify plugin settings.
*   **CSS Injection:**  The lack of authorization allows attackers to inject arbitrary CSS into saved layouts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary CSS Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious CSS code into the website's layouts. This could lead to a variety of issues, including:
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the visual appearance of the website.
    *   **Phishing:** Creating fake login forms or other deceptive elements.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *  **Denial of Service:** Hiding crucial content by making elements invisible.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated REST API Calls:** The attack is carried out by making HTTP POST requests to a specific REST endpoint (`/visual-portfolio/v1/update_layout`) without any authentication.
*   **Exploitation of 'data[vp_custom_css]' parameter:** The 'data[vp_custom_css]' parameter within the POST request allows for the injection of malicious CSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:**  Attackers do not need any specific user privileges or even a user account on the WordPress website to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is Visual Portfolio with versions prior to 2.18.0.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "NO AUTHORISATION" and is related to "Broken Access Control" (OWASP A5).
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject CSS using the REST API endpoint.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
*   The severity is rated as "medium" with a CVSS score of 5.3.
