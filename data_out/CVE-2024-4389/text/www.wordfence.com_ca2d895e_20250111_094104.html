### Description

The Slider and Carousel slider by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the uploadFile function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
