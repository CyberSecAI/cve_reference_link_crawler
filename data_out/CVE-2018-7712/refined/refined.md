Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from assertion failures within the OpenCV library's `validateInputImageSize` function, specifically in the `imgcodecs` module. These assertions check for conditions related to image dimensions and pixel counts during image loading. When these conditions are not met due to malformed or extremely large images, the assertions trigger exceptions, which can lead to program termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Uncontrolled Image Dimensions/Size:** The code does not properly handle cases where an image has extremely large dimensions or a huge pixel count.
-   **Assertion-Based Termination:** The use of `CV_Assert` throws a C++ exception which, if uncaught, causes the program to terminate. Although it's intended to catch programming errors, it's being triggered with potentially user-controlled data, which leads to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious actor can craft a specially formed image file which, when loaded by an application using OpenCV, triggers the assertion failure, causing the application to terminate and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Malicious Image Files:** Attackers can supply crafted image files with dimensions or total pixel counts that exceed the limits defined within the `validateInputImageSize` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a malicious image file as input to an application using the vulnerable OpenCV library. This may occur by getting a user to open a malicious file, or in a server-side scenario.
-   **Knowledge of Library Behavior:** The attacker likely needs some awareness of the limitations of OpenCV's image loading process to craft images that trigger the specific assertions.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The provided content includes example crash logs for different assertion failures with the following:
  -   `pixels <= (1<<30)`: Checks that total pixels are not excessively high.
  -   `size.width <= (1<<20)`: Checks that image width is not too large.
  -   `size.height <= (1<<20)`: Checks that image height is not too large.
-   The provided content includes links to the CVE page on NIST, which indicates the CVEs were disputed.
-   The issue was considered invalid by an OpenCV member, as it's the responsibility of application developers to catch exceptions from libraries.

In summary, CVE-2018-7712 describes a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in OpenCV where malformed images can trigger assertion failures and cause the application to terminate.
