# Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow

Critical

[BeryJu](/BeryJu)
published
GHSA-9qwp-jf7p-vr7h
Dec 23, 2022

## Package

authentik

## Affected versions

< 2022.11.3
< 2022.10.3

## Patched versions

2022.11.4
2022.10.4

## Description

### Summary

Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided.

### Patches

authentik 2022.11.4, 2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0 fix this issue, for other versions the workaround can be used.

### Impact

Only configurations using both invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow.

### Details

The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used.

### Workarounds

As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.

### PoC

1. Create two `enrollment flow` ( `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) in the admin interface (as you normally would)
2. Make `enrollment-invitation-test` assign the `test` group to the user when signed up
3. Make `enrollment-invitation-admin` assign the `admin` group to the user when signed up
4. Generate an invitation URL via the admin interface
5. Bind the `enrollment-invitation-test` to it
6. Use the url to signup but change the `enrollment-invitation-test` part in the URL to `enrollment-invitation-admin`
7. The URL is still valid (even though the admin interface has NOT chosen that flow to be bound to that invitation)
8. Sign up, you're now an admin

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
