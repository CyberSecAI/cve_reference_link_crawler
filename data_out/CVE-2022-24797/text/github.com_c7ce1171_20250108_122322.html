# Exposure of debug and metrics endpoints in Pomerium

Moderate

[travisgroth](/travisgroth)
published
GHSA-q98f-2x4p-prjr
Mar 30, 2022

## Package

gomod

pomerium
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v0.16.0-v0.17.0

## Patched versions

v0.17.1

## Description

### Impact

In distributed service mode, Pomerium's Authenticate service exposes pprof debug and prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This can leak potentially sensitive environmental information or lead to limited denial of service conditions.

### Patches

v0.17.1

### Workarounds

Block access to `/debug` and `/metrics` paths on the authenticate service. This can be done with any L7 proxy, including Pomerium's own proxy service.

### References

[#3212](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/3212)
