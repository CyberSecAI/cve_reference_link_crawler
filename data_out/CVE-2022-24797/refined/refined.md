Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Pomerium Authenticate service, when running in distributed service mode, incorrectly exposed pprof debug and Prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This was due to the debug and metrics endpoints being served on the same listener as the main application logic, instead of being isolated on a separate listener.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of sensitive endpoints: The pprof debug and Prometheus metrics endpoints were unintentionally exposed to untrusted traffic.
- Lack of proper access control: The debug and metrics endpoints did not have proper access controls in place, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: The exposed pprof debug endpoints could leak sensitive environmental information, potentially including internal configurations, memory usage, and other debugging details.
- Limited Denial of Service (DoS): The exposed metrics endpoints could be abused to trigger a DoS condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: An attacker would need network access to the exposed debug and metrics endpoints of the Pomerium Authenticate service. This could be from an internal network or from the public internet, depending on the service's network configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Pomerium Authenticate service.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability existed due to the lack of access controls on the exposed debug and metrics endpoints. Thus, no authentication or authorization was needed for exploitation.
