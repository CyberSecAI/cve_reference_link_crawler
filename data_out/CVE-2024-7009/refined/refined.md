Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the content:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` parameters within the full-text search functionality of Calibre's content server. These parameters are directly embedded into the SQL query string without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the SQLite database context. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` input fields before using them in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from any SQLite database present on the server's filesystem. This includes databases containing user credentials (e.g., `server-users.sqlite`).
    *   **Limited File System Writes:** Attackers can perform limited filesystem writes by using the `ATTACH DATABASE` command with a non-existing filename to create a new database, then writing arbitrary data to a table in the created database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to the `/fts/snippets/{book_ids}` endpoint of Calibre's content server.
    *   **Malicious Query Parameters:** The exploit uses crafted values for the `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` URL parameters to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a low privilege user account with the ability to perform full-text searches on any Calibre library via the content server.
    *   **Knowledge of File Paths:**  The attacker needs to know the file paths of the SQLite databases they want to target, such as the path to `server-users.sqlite`. This might require knowledge of the user's profile name on Windows or other operating-system specific paths.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is an SQL injection issue present in the full-text search functionality of Calibre's content server. The `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` parameters, which are intended to highlight text within search results, are not sanitized before being included in SQL queries. This allows a low-privileged user to inject arbitrary SQL commands, read from other SQLite databases on the file system, and perform limited file write operations. This allows an attacker to compromise the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a CVSS 3.1 score and vector string.
*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability affects all versions of Calibre up to and including 7.15.0.
*   The suggested mitigation is to sanitize the `highlight_start` and `highlight_end` parameters by escaping single quotes or by using parameterized queries.
