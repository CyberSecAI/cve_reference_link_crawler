- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Modified Facet widget in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists because a crafted payload injected into a facet label is not properly sanitized.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker injects a malicious payload into the facet label within the Modified Facet widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and needs user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the XSS, meaning they must convince a user to view the malicious payload after it has been stored.
