Based on the provided commit, the changes relate to the following vulnerabilities:

**1. HTML Input Sanitization:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided HTML inputs.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The `MessageInput.svelte` component was not sanitizing the user-provided message before sending it to the server. This allowed malicious HTML/script to be injected via user input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A user inputs malicious HTML code into the message input field.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Any user of the application can perform this attack.

**Mitigation:**
    *   The commit introduces sanitization of the user input using `DOMPurify.sanitize` in `MessageInput.svelte` before sending the input to the backend.
    *   Additionally, it introduces HTML escaping using `escapeHTML` function, to further mitigate the XSS risk.

**2. CORS Misconfiguration:**

*   **Root Cause:** The backend Flask app had a misconfiguration in its Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings.
*   **Vulnerability:** The initial CORS configuration only allowed requests from `https://localhost:3000`, which could be too restrictive.
*    **Impact:** This could potentially block legitimate requests from other origins, or be exploited if the allowed origin is manipulated.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requests originating from unauthorized origins could be blocked, or in case of manipulation of allowed origins, malicious requests may get through.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker attempting to interact with the API from an unauthorized origin.

**Mitigation:**
    * The commit modifies the CORS configuration to `CORS(app)`, which allows cross-origin requests from any origin.

**3. Path Traversal Vulnerability:**
*   **Root Cause:** The application was vulnerable to path traversal attacks when handling project file operations.
*   **Vulnerability:** User-provided project names were not sanitized before being used to construct file paths, allowing attackers to access or modify arbitrary files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could use specially crafted project names to traverse the file system, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a malicious project name containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Any user able to create, delete, or download project files could exploit this.

**Mitigation:**
  * The commit uses  `secure_filename` from `werkzeug.utils` to sanitize project names, mitigating the path traversal risk in `src/apis/project.py`. The following endpoints were updated:
      * `/api/get-project-files`
      * `/api/create-project`
      * `/api/delete-project`
      * `/api/download-project`
      * `/api/download-project-pdf`
    * Additionally, `src/project.py` was modified to check if the project path is within the allowed base path using  `os.path.commonprefix`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The commit also removes the use of `AgentState.get_project_files` in `devika.py`, and introduces `ProjectManager.get_project_files` to access project files.
* The `state.py` file is updated to remove the `get_project_files` function which was moved to `project.py`.

The commit message "Fix: Sanitizing HTML inputs and Cors misconfiguration" accurately reflects the major security fixes introduced, with the addition of file sanitization to prevent path traversal.
