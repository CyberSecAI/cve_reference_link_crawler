- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the ability of a user creating a "Cloned Website" Canarytoken to insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. This Javascript then executes when the creator browses the management page for their own Canarytoken.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The injected Javascript code executes when the Canarytoken creator views the management page, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's browser session. While it's a self-XSS, the management link could be sent to a victim, causing the Javascript to execute in the victim's browser. However, it is explicitly stated that no sensitive information (e.g., session information) will be disclosed to a malicious actor.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious destination URL in a "Cloned Website" Canarytoken, an attacker (or in this case the creator of the token) can inject JavaScript that will execute when the token management page is visited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create a "Cloned Website" Canarytoken. They could then potentially send the management link to a victim, although the described impact is limited.
