- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in the implementation of the app lock feature within the ownCloud Android application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly enforce the app lock, allowing bypass. Specifically, it did not properly implement the lock screen.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the device can bypass the app lock and gain access to the application's data and functionality. This allows them to view, modify, or delete files stored within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have physical possession of the device with the vulnerable ownCloud Android app installed.
