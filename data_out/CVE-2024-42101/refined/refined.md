The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42101.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing NULL pointer check in the `nouveau_connector_get_modes()` function within the Nouveau DRM driver for NVIDIA GPUs. Specifically, the return value of `drm_mode_duplicate()` is assigned to a `mode` variable without verifying if the duplication was successful. If `drm_mode_duplicate()` fails it returns `NULL` and results in a NULL pointer dereference when `drm_mode_probed_add` attempts to access the members of mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A NULL pointer dereference can cause a kernel crash or denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the `nouveau_connector_get_modes()` function is called, specifically when `drm_mode_duplicate` fails. This is related to display mode handling in the DRM subsystem.
- It is not specified if a local or remote attacker can trigger this issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `nouveau_connector_get_modes` function, which occurs during display mode detection/handling with a Nouveau driven NVIDIA GPU.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix adds a check to ensure the return value of `drm_mode_duplicate()` is not `NULL` before proceeding.
- The fix was introduced in commit `80bec6825b19d95ccdfd3393cf8ec15ff2a749b4`.
- This was introduced in the commit `6ee738610f41` which added the nouveau driver.
