- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the full path of the web application. This information can be used to aid other attacks. The vulnerability itself does not cause direct damage, but can provide useful information to an attacker when combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities or position is required. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
