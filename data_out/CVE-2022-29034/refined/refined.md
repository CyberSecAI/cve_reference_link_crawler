{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's web interface error message pop-up window does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the /services/syslog_client_settings endpoint. Specifically, the `address` parameter is vulnerable. The injected payload is reflected in an error message pop-up window within the web interface.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the affected endpoint. User interaction is required as the victim needs to view the error message pop-up for the XSS to trigger."

  "affected_products": [
    {
      "product": "SINEMA Remote Connect Server",
      "versions": "< V3.1"

  ],
    "remediation": "Update to version V3.1 or later.",
    "additional_notes": "The advisory mentions that dots (`.`) in the injected JavaScript payload are filtered by an IP parser. The provided proof of concept circumvents this by encoding the JavaScript payload in base64 and using `atob()` to decode it. The vulnerability is triggered when setting the syslog server to an illegal IP address.",
