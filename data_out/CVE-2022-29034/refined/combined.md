PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take 'issuercert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case insensitively*, which could lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all, and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn't include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

| CWE | CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference |

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly when parsing the string provided by the application.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively, which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all,
and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer cert’
which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2022-29034)
The application contains a reflected cross-site-scripting vulnerability that
can be used to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2022-29034)
The error occurs when setting the syslog server to an illegal IP address. An
error message will pop up and will reflect the supplied IP address. However,
the popup message does not use the proper JQuery method, and thus allows to
inject JavaScript code. Note that dots can not be used in the JavaScript
payload, as they will get filtered by the IP parser that runs beforehand.
This was circumvented by supplying the JavaScript code in base64.

Following request can be used to trigger the XSS:
