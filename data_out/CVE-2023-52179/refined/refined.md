- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (Subscriber) can perform actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the function in question, however, the severity is rated as low and unlikely to be exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's vulnerable function which lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber to the WordPress site.
