### Description

The Opal Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to featured property modifications in versions up to, and including, 1.6.11. This is due to missing capability checks on the opalestate\_set\_feature\_property() and opalestate\_remove\_feature\_property() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set and remove featured properties.
