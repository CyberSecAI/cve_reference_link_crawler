Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks within the `opalestate_set_feature_property()` and `opalestate_remove_feature_property()` functions in the Opal Estate WordPress plugin. These functions are responsible for setting and removing featured properties, respectively.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper capability checks in the mentioned functions. This means that the plugin does not verify if the user making the request has the necessary permissions to modify featured properties.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin uses a direct reference to the `property_id` within the request, allowing an attacker to manipulate this value to target arbitrary properties.
*   **Lack of CSRF protection:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the CVE description, the blog post from nintechnet shows the vulnerable code and highlights that nonce verification is also missing (see line 183 and 195 in the `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content), thus making these functions also vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification:** Unauthenticated attackers can arbitrarily set or remove featured property status.
*   **Content Manipulation:** This can lead to the modification of the website's displayed content, potentially prioritizing less desirable content, demoting important content or making the website look unprofessional.
*   **Potential for SEO manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the properties to influence search engine rankings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP requests:** Attackers can send direct POST requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints (`wp_ajax_opalestate_set_feature_property` and `wp_ajax_opalestate_remove_feature_property`) without needing to be logged in.
*   **CSRF Attack:** Since nonce verification is missing, the attacker can also craft a CSRF attack that triggers the vulnerable functions.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The `property_id` parameter can be directly modified by the attacker to target any property on the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication is required:** The attacker does not need to have a user account on the WordPress site, as the vulnerability is present for both logged in and logged out requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article states that there is no known patch available and the plugin is closed.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
*   The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content confirms the vulnerable code in the file `inc/ajax-functions.php`.
*   The NinTechNet blog post also includes other vulnerabilities regarding missing nonce checks, which is also present in the described code and relevant to this vulnerability.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, highlighting the specific functions affected, the nature of the missing authorization checks, and the potential impact of exploitation.
