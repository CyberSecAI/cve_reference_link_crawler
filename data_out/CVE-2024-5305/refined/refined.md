Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files. Specifically, the program fails to check the size of the input before copying it into a fixed-size stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when data larger than the buffer's capacity is copied into it, potentially overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The lack of validation on user-supplied data lengths is the root cause of the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (Kofax Power PDF). This can lead to complete control of the application and potentially the system it's running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing the overflowing data. When the target user opens this malicious PDF using Kofax Power PDF, the vulnerability is triggered.
- **Malicious webpage:** The vulnerability can also be triggered if the user visits a webpage that attempts to open or render such a malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim, which can be through email, web downloads, or other methods.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges on the target system to perform this attack.
- User interaction is required, meaning the user must open the malicious PDF file or visit a webpage that attempts to do so.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided advisory gives a clear description of the vulnerability, which is a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation while parsing PDF files.
- It also mentions that a coordinated public release of the advisory was done.
- The advisory provides a link to the vendor's information which might include more specific details.
