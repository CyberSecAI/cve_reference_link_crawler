Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to unsanitized input in the `manage_user.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the `id` parameter received via the GET method into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Data Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read any data from the database, potentially including sensitive information such as user credentials, personal details, and other application data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/index.php` endpoint with the `page` parameter set to `manage_user` and a malicious payload in the `id` parameter, e.g., `/index.php?page=manage_user&id=1' or '1'='1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to construct HTTP requests.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** Based on the provided exploit steps, it seems like the attacker needs to be logged into the backend of the application to exploit this vulnerability. However, the information is not explicit about authentication needs and the vulnerability might also be exploitable without being logged in.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) using SQLmap to demonstrate the exploit.
- The vulnerability is present in Sourcecodester House Rental Management System version 1.0, specifically in the `manage_user.php` file.
- The injection point is the `$_GET['id']` parameter.
