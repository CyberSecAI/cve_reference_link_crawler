{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists between the `.runtime_idle()` callback and the `.remove()` callback in PCI drivers. Specifically, when a driver is being removed, `pm_runtime_get_sync()` is called. However, this function does not guarantee that the `.runtime_idle()` callback will not be running concurrently. If a `.runtime_idle()` callback is active when `pm_runtime_get_sync()` is called, `pm_runtime_get_sync()` will return immediately because the device is in `RPM_ACTIVE` state, without waiting for the `.runtime_idle()` callback to complete. This can lead to a race condition where the `.remove()` callback may proceed while the `.runtime_idle()` callback is still active, resulting in a kernel crash (e.g., an unhandled page fault).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition between power management callbacks",
       "Inadequate synchronization of power management calls"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel crash due to an unhandled page fault.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the removal of a PCI driver with a `.runtime_idle()` callback.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to trigger the removal of a vulnerable PCI device's driver with a  `.runtime_idle()` callback while that callback is already running."
  },
  "fix": "The fix involves adding a call to `pm_runtime_barrier()` after `pm_runtime_get_sync()` in `pci_device_remove()`. `pm_runtime_barrier()` will wait for the `.runtime_idle()` callback to complete before proceeding with the driver removal, thus preventing the race condition.",
  "additional_notes": "The issue was specifically identified in the `rtsx_pcr` PCI driver. The fix is applied to the generic `pci_device_remove()` function, addressing the problem for all PCI drivers that implement `.runtime_idle()` callbacks."
