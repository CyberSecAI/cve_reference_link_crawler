# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1573

## Robustel R1510 web\_server ajax endpoints OS command injection vulnerabilities

##### June 30, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-33326,CVE-2022-33329,CVE-2022-33327,CVE-2022-33325,CVE-2022-33328

### Summary

Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist in the web\_server ajax endpoints functionalities of Robustel R1510 3.3.0. A specially-crafted network packets can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.

### Tested Versions

Robustel R1510 3.3.0

### Product URLs

R1510 - <https://www.robustel.com/en/product/r1510-industrial-cellular-vpn-router/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others

The R1510 has a web server that manages several endpoints. One group of endpoints have the following form `/ajax/<API_endpoint>/`.
Several of those endpoints use unsafe functions with user provided parameters, like the standard `system` function, and a custom one called `sysprintf`.

Here it is `sysprintf`:

```
void sysprintf(char *format_string,char *param_2,char *char*,char *param_4)

{
  [...]

  va_list_ptr = va_list;
  va_list[0] = param_2;
  va_list[1] = char*;
  va_list[2] = param_4;
  vsnprintf(shell_command,0x200,format_string,va_list_ptr);                                             [1]
  system(shell_command);                                                                                [2]
  return;
}

```

At `[1]` a string is formatted, using the first argument of the function as format string and the others parameters as format string arguments. If one of the argument is controllable by an attacker a command injection would occur at `[2]`.

#### CVE-2022-33325 - /ajax/clear\_tools\_log/ command injection

This command injection is in the `/ajax/clear_tools_log/` API.

The function that handles that endpoint is:

```
undefined4 /ajax/clear_tools_log/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

  [...]
      tools_name = (char *)websGetVar(webs,"tools_name",0);                                             [3]
      iVar1 = string_is_not_empty(tools_name);
      if (iVar1 != 0) {
        TOOLS_LOG_FILE_MARK = websGetSessionVar(webs,"_:TOOLS_LOG_FILE_MARK:_","0");
        pcVar5 = (char *)sfmt("rm %s/wlf_%s_%s.log -rf","/tmp/log/tools",tools_name,                    [4]
                              TOOLS_LOG_FILE_MARK);
        iVar1 = system(pcVar5);                                                                         [5]
        [...]

```

At `[3]` the `tools_name` variable is fetched and then, at `[4]`, used to format a string. The formatted string is then used at `[5]` as argument for the system function. This can lead to a command injection.

#### CVE-2022-33326 - /ajax/config\_rollback/ command injection

This command injection is in the `/ajax/config_rollback/` API.

The function that handles that endpoint is:

```
undefined4 /ajax/config_rollback/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

  [...]
        archive_param = websGetVar(webs,"archive",0);                                                   [6]
        iVar4 = dir_exists("/app/config/rollback_archive");
        iVar1 = -1;
        if (iVar4 != 0) {
          sysprintf("mkdir -p %s","/tmp/config_rollback");
          iVar1 = sysprintf("tar -C %s -zxf %s/%s.tgz && uci -c import %s/config.xml && rm %s -rf",
                            "/tmp/config_rollback","/app/config/rollback_archive",archive_param,
                            "/tmp/config_rollback","/tmp/config_rollback");                             [7]
          iVar1 = -(uint)(iVar1 != 0);
        }

```

At `[6]` the `archive` variable is fetched and then used as argument of the `sysprintf` function at `[7]`. This can lead to a command injection.

#### CVE-2022-33327 - /ajax/remove\_sniffer\_raw\_log/ command injection

This command injection is in the `/ajax/remove_sniffer_raw_log/` API.

The function that handles that endpoint is:

```
undefined4 /ajax/remove_sniffer_raw_log/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

  [...]
      file_name = (char *)websGetVar(webs,"file_name",0);                                               [8]
      if ((file_name != (char *)0x0) && (pcVar5 = strstr(file_name,".."), pcVar5 == (char *)0x0)) {
        shell_command = (char *)sfmt("rm %s/%s -rf","/tmp/log/sniffer",file_name);                      [9]
        iVar1 = system(shell_command);                                                                  [10]
        [...]

```

At `[8]` the `file_name` variable is fetched and then, at `[9]`, used to format a string. The formatted string is then used at `[10]` as argument for the system function. This can lead to a command injection.

#### CVE-2022-33328 - /ajax/remove/ command injection

This command injection is in the `/ajax/remove/` API.

The function that handles that endpoint is:

```
undefined4 /ajax/remove/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

  [...]
      file_name = (char *)websGetVar(webs,"file_name",0);                                               [11]
      if ((file_name != (char *)0x0) &&
         (shell_command = strstr(file_name,".."), shell_command == (char *)0x0)) {
        shell_command = (char *)sfmt("rm %s -rf",file_name);                                            [12]
        iVar1 = system(shell_command);                                                                  [13]
        [...]
}

```

At `[11]` the `file_name` variable is fetched and then, at `[12]`, used to format a string. The formatted string is then used at `[13]` as argument for the system function. This can lead to a command injection.

#### CVE-2022-33329 - /ajax/set\_sys\_time/ command injection

This command injection is in the `/ajax/set_sys_time/` API.

The function that handles that endpoint is:

```
undefined4 /ajax/set_sys_time/(Webs *webs)

{
  [...]

  [...]
      date = websGetVar(webs,"date",0);                                                                 [14]
      if ((date != 0) && (iVar3 = string_is_empty(date), iVar3 == 0)) {
        sysprintf("date \"%s\"",date);                                                                  [15]
        [...]
}

```

At `[14]` the `date` variable is fetched and then used at `[15]` as argument of the `sysprintf` function. This can lead to a command injection.
