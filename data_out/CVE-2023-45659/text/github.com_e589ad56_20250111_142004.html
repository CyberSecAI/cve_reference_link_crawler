## Package

engelsystem
(engelsystem)

## Affected versions

all versions before dbb089315ff3d8aabc11445e78fb50765208b27d

## Patched versions

from commit dbb089315ff3d8aabc11445e78fb50765208b27d

## Description

### Impact

If a users' password is compromised and an attacker gained access to a users' account, i.e., logged in and obtained a session, an attackers' session is not terminated if the users' account password is reset.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed in the following commit: [dbb0893](https://github.com/engelsystem/engelsystem/commit/dbb089315ff3d8aabc11445e78fb50765208b27d)

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds available. Users are advised to upgrade to at least [dbb0893](https://github.com/engelsystem/engelsystem/commit/dbb089315ff3d8aabc11445e78fb50765208b27d)

### PoC by Eugene Shein

After setting up an engelsystem instance on `http://localhost:5080/settings/password`, open `http://localhost:5080/settings/password` in 2 browsers (I use Firefox and Chromium)

Log in using these both browser with same login credentials

Change password from the Firefox browser

After password changed, refresh the page on the Chromium browser

Observe that the session will not expire after password resetting

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
