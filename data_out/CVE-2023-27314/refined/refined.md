- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in ONTAP 9 that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a crash of the HTTP service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service issue in the handling of HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to the crashing of the HTTP service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability over the network without needing credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ONTAP 9 system and does not need to be authenticated.
