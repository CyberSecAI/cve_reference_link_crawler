### Conversational Forms

One of the best features of any form builder plugin is its ability to create different types of forms. One of the key features of Fluent Forms is conversational forms. With conversational forms, users get one question at a time, unlike traditional forms. This reduces distraction and results in a higher form completion rate. There are multiple layout options to serve your purpose. There are multiple sharing options for conversational forms, including direct URLs, shortcodes, HTML embedding and more.

[View Conversational Form Demo](https://fluentforms.com/?fluent-form=138)

With Fluent Forms Pro, you can enjoy more advanced functionalities in conversational forms. Users can browse through questions with scroll and key press. They can also customize the fonts, colors, backgrounds, and more to match brand identity.

### Built-in Data Visualization Tool

With Fluent Forms, you can easily analyze form submissions using pie charts, bar charts, or tabular views. Whether you’re using it as a form plugin, or quiz builder, Fluent Forms simplifies data analysis for you. You can graphically see the results of any survey or poll in real-time.

### Email Notification

Get notified every time someone submits a form and also send a confirmation email to the one who fills out the form. To make it more advanced, you can use conditional email notifications to send emails when certain conditions are met.

### Multi-column Form Layout

Stack input fields in multiple columns and make the long, boring form appear compact and smart. This will lead to a lower form abandonment rate. There are six types of column containers to choose from.

### Conditional Logic

Show or hide specific input fields according to users’ behavior so they do not have to be bothered with unnecessary fields. Users can set multiple conditions by selecting input fields and defining rules such as equal, not equal, greater than, less than, includes, not includes and more. Using conditional logic, you can receive email notifications automatically upon form submissions and display different confirmation messages to different users when specific conditions are met.

### Calculator for Advanced Form Calculation

The numeric field of Fluent Forms gives you the power to create smart calculators. Whether it’s a car loan calculator, BMI calculator, simple mortgage calculator, or tax calculator, creating these calculator forms is a no-brainer. You can set minimum and maximum values to define the acceptable range for numerical input fields.

### Create PDF Files from Form Submission

Generate PDF from your submitted entries and let users download the PDF file or send it via email. You can use this feature to generate invoices, create reports, or provide order summaries.

### Conditional Confirmation

Fluent Forms Pro allows you to send customized confirmation messages to your users if they meet specific conditions.

### Advanced Form Styler

In Fluent Forms Pro, you can easily customize your contact forms. In this way, you can attract more visitors with amazing form design and boost form conversion. With Advanced Form Styler, you can adjust the colors and fonts, add box shadows and borders, and set margins and padding. Moreover, you can import styles from previously designed forms in no time.

### Build Quizzes & Surveys

Fluent Forms Pro is not just a contact form builder, but it can also be used as a powerful quiz builder. Fluent Forms as a quiz builder plugin allows you to create fun quizzes, personality quizzes, trivia quizzes, and more. You can assign scores to each question and let people know how they perform right after the form submission or via email notification. You can also run surveys and show survey results.

### Payment Forms

Fluent Forms Pro offers functionalities beyond contact forms, it is a powerful solution that you can use to create payment forms, product order forms, and donation forms. It integrates with popular payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay, Paddle, Square etc. so you can easily accept credit card payments on your website.

### One-Click Migrator

If you are already using Contact Form 7, WPForms, Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms or Gravity Forms and looking to move to Fluent Forms, you can do this with a single click.

### Fluent Forms CLI

Users are given incredible Command Line Interface (CLI) capabilities with Fluent Forms. For those who like to easily take control of their forms, this CLI tool is an amazing one. You can quickly create and manage forms, export or import data, track submissions, set up settings, and even explore plugin integration possibilities with Fluent Forms CLI. It’s a simple, effective approach for WordPress users who prefer the command line to take full advantage of Fluent Forms.

### Enhanced Email Routing & Automation

This form plugin has become the de facto standard for all our sites and our clients’ sites. It works very well, and the integration with FluentSMTP, FluentCRM, and Stripe Payments makes it even better.
The only thing I wish it had was more intuitive reporting associated with Payments. I’d like to be able to simply download a raw transactions list so that I can prepare revenue reports. An API or other programmatic access to the transactions would be even better.
