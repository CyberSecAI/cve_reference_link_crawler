Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-47080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero error in the RDMA subsystem of the Linux kernel. This error occurs because the `user_entry_size` is provided by the user and used as a denominator in a calculation for the number of entries. If the user provides a `user_entry_size` of zero, a divide-by-zero error will occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The code did not validate the `user_entry_size` before using it as a denominator in a division operation. This lack of validation allowed for the possibility of a divide-by-zero error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service. The specific error message is "divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI".

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a `user_entry_size` of zero when calling the `UVERBS_METHOD_QUERY_GID_TABLE` function through the RDMA userspace API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the RDMA userspace API, which is typically available to a user with sufficient privileges on the system.
