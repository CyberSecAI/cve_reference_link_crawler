| It would be pretty cool, if the builds of ofborg would also be downloadable. Then maintainers could get quite a lot more pull requests tested in shorter time.  If there would be a url where a expression with expression tarball could be downloaded, then one could do something like (it should be also possible to provide an actual tarball url for github pull requests)  ``` $ nix-shell 'https://gist.github.com/Mic92/93f65c4d42ac72c8d64397258cada90c/archive/0159f2d6894ea2928e0b05d6ee46349be81681d6.tar.gz' --command 'studio-link' ``` |

| [@7c6f434c](https://github.com/7c6f434c) If this was turned on per-builder, would it make all builders an attractive target? ie: if only the AWS machines were able to produce binaries, would you be uncomfortable running your own? |

| Well, my builder is behind a relatively stupid NAT with now ports forwarded, although who knows‚Ä¶ In any case, I don't care as much about having to wipe the builder, as about not making a promise that I keep an eye on it. That is definitely solved by per-builder approach. If we have good enough reproducibility, maybe cross-checking that two builders have obtained the same hash independently before signing with the key of a second, more limited cache (which shares bulk storage but has different metadata) could also be a good idea? That last part could eventually be done even for things I just happen to have built: if I have a log and a build and confirm that the build is local (the log requirement is useful, because it is easy to forget using binary cache, but not so easy to forget manually putting a log into /nix/var/log, why would anyone do it anyway), I run some ofborg command and if the same hash has already been declared, I am allowed to upload. Of course, 1 and 2 are not the only numbers of independent replications that can be tracked‚Ä¶ |

| It seems best to have all builders under one owner (or a few for redundancy) and then use something like <https://cachix.org/> to provide a binary cache. In the future, hydra might even reuse that if hydra owners == ofborg build owners. |

| That would be great, but note that one should first solve [NixOS/nix#969](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/969) otherwise this raises an important security issue, basically allowing any attacker (=person making the PR) to execute arbitrary code on the machine of the reviewer. The issue right now is that the cache is shared between all PR on Ofborg (which makes sense), but combined with [NixOS/nix#969](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/969) this can be quite dangerous as it is possible to send a malicious (not reviewed) PR containing a malicious code inserted in any program with some hash `malicioushash`, and then send in a reviewed PR the right PR, except that the hash is `malicioushash` instead of the valid hash. This way, the reviewer will run the malicious binary, even if the PR actually seems points to a valid source. |

| [@doronbehar](https://github.com/doronbehar) Sure, I even made a small example ^^   1. First, the attacker creates a clone of the source of the program, say that is officially located in `http://foo.com/example.com/` (this is the URL I used in my tests, it does not exists so if Ofborg does not complain, it means that it used the attacker URL), and adds some malicious code inside (say, that executes `rm -rf $HOME` when starting), say that the malicious URL is at `http://example.com/` (this is what I used in my example, this one exists). 2. Then the attacker creates a dummy PR like I did here <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/307709/files>. The exact content of the PR does not really matter, nobody will even need to review it, so the attacker can write a big *Work in progress* at the beginning to be sure nobody will check the content. What matters is that it should download the malicious code with something like `fetchurl` (the hash used here is `sha256-6o+sfGX7WJsNU1YPUlH3T56bJDR43Laz6nm142RJyNk=` in my test) , and Ofborg should also test it (like it did automatically in my case). This step has basically one goal : pollute the cache of Ofborg with the malicious code. 3. Then, the attacker creates another PR like I did here <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/307725/files> This PR is supposed to contain exactly the code for an honest PR, except that the hash used is not the true hash coming from the upstream project, but the hash used in step 2, `sha256-6o+sfGX7WJsNU1YPUlH3T56bJDR43Laz6nm142RJyNk=` in my example. As you can see, Ofborg will pass all tests (even if the "official URL" does not even exist), meaning that it used the cache from the first PR.   As of today, if a reviewer tries to review this last PR, they will get an error since the hash does not match the one obtained from the official URL. But if Ofborg & reviewers share the same cache (or even worse, if Hydra and Ofborg share the same cache, this would allow the attack to be executed on any user of the program and not just the reviewer), then the reviewer will basically download the version built by Ofborg, i.e. the malicious one. Just trying to run the program (which is expected from most reviewers) will execute the `rm -rf $HOME` (or maybe something more subtle like installing a keylogger)‚Ä¶ not something I'd love to have, especially from an innocent looking PR.  I just sent an email to the security team with other potential attacks related to #969 that can already be executed now (but in a slightly more convoluted manner), let's see what they say. |

Yes exactly, that was basically part of what I wrote in the email to the security maintainers ^^ (with some other attacks, e.g. relying on obfuscated automatically generated files)  So what I think we need is some CI check that will try to download any fixed output derivation that is new and verify it gets the same hash.  Why should this be a CI check? The attacks would still be possible if I just use a fork of nixpkgs without going through CI‚Ä¶ and maybe the reviewers would not wait for the CI to finish before testing the PR themself. Can't we directly modify nix's way of handling fix-output derivation, by basically re-running them whenever an unseen derivation is seen? (seems quite straightforward no?) |

Sounds not to hard to me too, but the question is, what would you consider an "unseen derivation"? Would you simply make Nix evaluation reevaluate all FODs that are not found in the local cache? Would you consider Hydra's cache safe? |

That would indeed be the safest option, but I'm thinking that it might be quite inefficient, as it means that we need to download the source of all the transitive dependencies before even considering downloading something from `cache.nixos.org`‚Ä¶ One can maybe add an option `--paranoid` for this behavior, and we can maybe enabled for `cache.nixos.org` (this should anyway not add too much overhead since it already have downloaded anything basically), but this seems quite hard to enforce on the end user‚Ä¶ I'm trying to see if we can imagine a solution that is both safe & with a minimal overhead.  Would you simply make Nix evaluation reevaluate all FODs that are not found in the local cache? Would you consider Hydra's cache safe?  That's a good question. So I think we **should** trust caches like `cache.nixos.org` (at least once they implement a fix for this issue, since anyway malicious caches could do anything), but I don't think that the current information that is shared by caches is enough. Indeed, for now, the cache says something like "I have a derivation whose hash is `foohash` but I don't know how it was generated"‚Ä¶ which is exactly the same information as what NixOs already tells you, which is, as we saw before, not secure.  So, in my opinion, I think that both users & cache should keep a table `derivation path -> hash`, and caches should share this table with users. This way, when a user wants to install a program:   1. first, whenever it finds a FOD (dependency, source‚Ä¶), it will check in its local table if `derivation -> hash` is present. If it is present, but not correct, abort. If it is present and correct, goto step 4 2. If it is not present, check on the cache if `derivation -> hash` is present. Again, check correctness if present and goto step 4 3. If it is still not present, execute the FOD locally, and check if the hash is correct, otherwise abort. 4. Once all dependencies have been checked, the rest is as usual: compute as usual the final hash of the program, and ask to the binary cache if is it present. If so, download it, otherwise build it.   Note that one may make this algorithm more efficient (so far it uses many rounds of communication with the server which is not great) by sending a single message to the server with the list of all FOD that could not be checked locally, with their expected hash. If the server sees a single hash mismatch, it aborts, and otherwise sends back the list of FOD that could not be checked.  Hope it make sense! |

| So what I think we need is some CI check that will try to download any fixed output derivation that is new and verify it gets the same hash.  I am currently working on such a thing. |
