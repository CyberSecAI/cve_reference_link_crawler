Root cause of vulnerability:
A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line in the virtual terminal driver.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The `scr_memcpyw` function is used to shift characters in the line buffer when deleting characters. However, if the destination buffer overlaps with the source buffer, `memcpy` does not guarantee correct behavior. This can lead to data corruption if the `scr_memcpyw` is optimized to `memcpy`.

Impact of exploitation:
Memory corruption, which can lead to data corruption in the virtual terminal's line buffer. The corruption may not be deterministic because it depends on the hardware acceleration used by `memcpy`.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by deleting characters in a long line within the virtual terminal. This can be done by a local user with access to the virtual terminal.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
A local user with the ability to interact with a virtual terminal.
