- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The URL field in Kirby CMS copies the entered URL into the link target of the link button without proper validation or sanitization. This allows a malicious user to inject `javascript:` URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Self Cross-site Scripting (Self-XSS), also called reflected XSS. The vulnerability is present in the URL field, which allows users to input URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A user with access to the Kirby panel can be tricked into executing malicious JavaScript code within their own context by clicking a crafted link button. This can lead to attackers potentially gaining access to the system or escalating their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to use social engineering to trick a user into entering a malicious `javascript:` URL into a URL field within the Kirby CMS panel and then get the user to click the link icon (`Ctrl+Click`/`Cmd+Click`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires knowledge of the content structure of the target Kirby site and requires the attacker to social engineer a user with access to the Kirby Panel. This attack cannot be automated.
