**Description**

`util-thash.c` initializes a random factor, however, this is not used. I suspect the intention was to introduce some randomness.

# datasets: missing hashtable random seed leads to potential DoS

High

[victorjulien](/victorjulien)
published
GHSA-64ww-4f6x-863p
Oct 16, 2024

## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

< 7.0.7

## Patched versions

7.0.7

## Description

### Impact

Missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to datasets having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset file loading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performance issues during traffic handling.

### Patches

This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.

### Workarounds

Avoid loading datasets from untrusted sources. Avoid dataset rules that track traffic in rules.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
