The provided content details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebEdition CMS version 9.2.2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Title`, `Description`, and `Keywords` fields when creating or editing a WebEdition page. The CMS fails to properly encode or escape these inputs before storing them in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable fields gets stored and is executed when the page is viewed or previewed by other users.
- Lack of input sanitization: The CMS doesn't sanitize or encode user-provided data in the `Title`, `Description`, and `Keywords` fields before saving to the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
-  Session hijacking through cookie theft.
-  Account takeover by redirecting to a malicious page or manipulating user actions within the application.
- Defacement of the web page.
-  Potential for further attacks within the application based on the level of access of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker injects a malicious script using the `Title`, `Description`, and `Keywords` fields during creation or editing of a WebEdition page.
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a user previews the crafted page in the CMS interface or directly accesses a related temp file through a specific URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who can create or modify pages within the WebEdition CMS.
-  Basic knowledge of HTML/JavaScript is needed to craft the XSS payload.
-  Access to the administrative panel or interface where content creation/editing takes place.
