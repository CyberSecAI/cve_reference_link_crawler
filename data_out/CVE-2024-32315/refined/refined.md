The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda FH1202 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `decodePwd` function, called within the `formWanParameterSetting` function, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. This occurs because the function copies user-supplied input (`adslPwd`) into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `decodePwd` function.
- Lack of input validation on the size of the `adslPwd` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution is possible by overwriting return addresses on the stack.
- The device can be crashed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/WanParameterSetting` endpoint.
- The attacker must set `wanType` to 2 and `connect` to 1 to reach the vulnerable code path.
- The `adslPwd` parameter within the POST request must contain a string large enough to overflow the buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated based on the provided info.
