Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4209

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:**
*   Plugin: Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP â€“ Page Builder Features
*   Versions: <= 3.2.36

**Root Cause:**
*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the countdown timer block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately clean user-provided data before storing it in the database.
*   **Missing Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly encode the stored data when it's rendered on a page, allowing JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post using the countdown timer block.
*   When a user views the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
