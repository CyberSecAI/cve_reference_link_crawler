{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Deserialization of untrusted data in ShardingSphere-Agent.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses SnakeYAML to deserialize a YAML configuration file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code by utilizing `java.net.URLClassLoader` to load a JAR from a specified URL and `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` to execute code loaded via the crafted class loader.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the target machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker modifies the ShardingSphere Agent YAML configuration file to include malicious instructions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs permission to modify the ShardingSphere Agent YAML configuration file and the target machine must be able to access the specified URL hosting the malicious JAR file."
