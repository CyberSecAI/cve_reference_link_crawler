|  | > [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | > \*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in the com.dropbox.android |
|  | > application 98.2.2 for Android. The Passcode feature allows |
|  | > authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain |
|  | > method's return value to true. In other words, an attacker could |
|  | > authenticate with an arbitrary passcode. NOTE: the vendor indicates |
|  | > that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their |
|  | > threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has |
|  | > occurred. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > Exploitation Narrative for bypass local authentication on Passcode |
|  | > |
|  | > 1. We noticed that information regarding the passcode authentication |
|  | > is disclosed through Android system log which could be identified |
|  | > using "adb logcat" command while the application was running. |
|  | > |
|  | > 2. Once the Passcode authentication method was called (By entering |
|  | > invalid Passcode), the application class would be shown through system |
|  | > log which is "com.dropbox.android.activity.lock.LockCodeActivity". |
|  | > |
|  | > 3. De-compiling process was used to determine application logic |
|  | > through source code. Even the application was minified (Seems to be |
|  | > using Proguard), We still can analyse the logic of Passcode |
|  | > authentication on the "b" method and found that the return type is Boolean |
|  | > type. |
|  | > |
|  | > 4. Frida script was created to hook into "b" method in order to force |
|  | > the return value to be "true". |
|  | > |
|  | > Recommendation |
|  | > |
|  | > \* Remove logging on Passcode authentication method from |
|  | > com.dropbox.android.activity.lock.LockCodeActivity |
|  | > |
|  | > \* Consider code obfuscation not only using Proguard due to it is just |
|  | > minify not obfuscating |
