- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application did not properly sanitize user-controlled input within the SAML login error message, allowing for the injection of HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the error message on the SAML login page would render clickable HTML links injected via a crafted URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, would display a clickable HTML link within the SAML login error message. This could be leveraged for phishing attacks, deceiving users into clicking malicious links.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, injects HTML into the SAML error message displayed on the login page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that will be used to access the SAML login page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required to trigger the attack.
