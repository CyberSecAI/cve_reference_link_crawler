Based on the commit message "Fix rsa oaep key length check before decryption" and the code diff, the following vulnerability information can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient key length check before RSA OAEP decryption. Specifically, the code was checking if the size of the input gibberish is greater than the key size which is good. However the code was also missing a check that the size of the key should be large enough to hold the two hashes and padding needed in RSA OAEP. 

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate key size validation during RSA OAEP decryption. The code was missing a check that the size of the key should be large enough to hold the two hashes and padding needed in RSA OAEP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If the key size is too small to hold the required data, decryption might lead to unexpected behavior such as buffer overflows or other memory-related issues, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure or potentially a successful decryption with wrong padding, leading to information leakage if it happens in an implementation where an attacker has control on the encrypted data and can run trial decryption attempts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could supply a ciphertext encrypted with RSA-OAEP using a key size that's too small to perform the decryption, triggering the vulnerability during the decryption process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply ciphertexts to the vulnerable decryption routine. This would typically be the case if the vulnerable code is part of a protocol that accepts encrypted data for processing.
