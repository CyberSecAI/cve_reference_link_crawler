SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities were identiﬁed in the webserver of Q200 devices. These include Cross Site
Request Forgery (CSRF), session ﬁxation, missing secure ﬂags in HTTP cookies and memory corruption
issues due to missing input validation that could lead to remote code execution.

Siemens has released an update for POWER METER SICAM Q200 family and recommends to update to
the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

POWER METER SICAM Q200 family:
All versions < V2.70

Update to V2.70 or later version
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109743592/
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at Q200 devices
• Restrict access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

POWER METER SICAM Q200 is a multifunctional device for detecting, reporting, and analyzing measured
values and events.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43398

Affected devices do not renew the session cookie after login/logout and also accept user deﬁned
session cookies. An attacker could overwrite the stored session cookie of a user. After the victim
logged in, the attacker is given access to the user’s account through the activated session.

CWE-384: Session Fixation

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43439

Affected devices do not properly validate the Language-parameter in requests to the web interface on
port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an
automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43545

Affected devices do not properly validate the RecordType-parameter in requests to the web interface
on port 443/tcp. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to crash the device (followed by an
automatic reboot) or to execute arbitrary code on the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-30901

The web interface of the affected devices are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. By
tricking an authenticated victim user to click a malicious link, an attacker could perform arbitrary
actions on the device on behalf of the victim user.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-31238

Affected devices are missing cookie protection ﬂags when using the default settings. An attacker who
gains access to a session token can use it to impersonate a legitimate application user.
