This is likely due to the execution of a branch instruction (ex: 'call') with a bad argument, but it could also be due to execution continuing past the end of a memory region or another cause. Regardless this likely indicates that the program counter contents are tainted and can be contro lled by an attacker.

| TIFFICC is just A SAMPLE on how to use the library, it is not sanitized in any way, nor discussed in the manuals.  You should not use samples for disclosing CVE, as this is like calling the functions with bogus parameters.  If you have a profile that can break the library (which could be used for real exploits) I will be glad to help in fixing it. |

| Hi [@mm2](https://github.com/mm2) , I understand that you do not agree with this vulnerability as it is very unlikely but do you plan to contact MITRE and dispute/reject it ? because this is assigned with [CVE-2018-11555](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11555)  Thanks in advance ! :) |
