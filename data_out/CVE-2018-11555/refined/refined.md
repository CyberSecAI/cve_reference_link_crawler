The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11555.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The primary root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the Little CMS library, particularly within the `tificc` utility, which is a sample program provided with the library. This allows for crafted ICC profiles and image data to trigger various memory-related errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The identified vulnerabilities include:
   * **Out-of-bounds write:** In `PrecalculatedXFORM`, an out-of-bounds write occurs due to incorrect handling of pixel data, leading to a segmentation fault when writing to an invalid memory location.
   * **Invalid memory access:** Multiple issues involving invalid memory access such as reading from/writing to invalid addresses, or using pointers without validation (NULL pointer dereference), exist in functions such as `cmsEvalToneCurve16`, `AllocateToneCurveStruct`, `cmsReadHeader`, `Pack3Bytes`, `cmsPipelineCheckAndRetreiveStages`, `UnrollDoubleTo16`, `PackPlanarBytes`, `EvaluateCurves`, `FastIdentity16`, `Unroll1ByteReversed`, and `UnrollAnyWords`.
   * **Heap overflow:** A heap overflow is triggered due to a lack of input validation leading to a memory corruption during memory allocation

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
   * **Segmentation faults:** Causing the program to crash.
   * **Code execution:** In some instances, such as the out-of-bounds write in `PrecalculatedXFORM`, the attacker can potentially control the program counter and execute arbitrary code.
   * **Memory corruption:** Leading to unpredictable program behavior and possible further exploitable conditions.
   * **Denial of service:** Repeated crashes can be used to prevent a system from processing images.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors generally involve:
   * **Crafted ICC profiles:** Providing malicious ICC profiles to the tificc utility triggers parsing issues.
   * **Malicious image data:** Supplying carefully crafted image data to the transform functions of the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   * The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted ICC profile or a specially crafted input image to the Little CMS library, typically through the `tificc` utility.
   * No special position or privileges are necessary to trigger the identified issues

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported with a specific commit `684dfb8` of Little CMS.
*   The project maintainer has disputed the validity of the vulnerability, stating that `tificc` is a sample utility and not meant to be sanitized for security. However, the assigned CVE implies that the underlying library is vulnerable through this attack vector.
*   The provided content includes 15 different Proof-of-Concept (POC) files, each demonstrating a different way the Little CMS library can crash. These POCs cover a wide range of issues including out of bound writes, null pointer dereferences and heap overflows.
