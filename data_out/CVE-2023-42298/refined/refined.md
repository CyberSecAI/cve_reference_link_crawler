- **Root cause:** An integer overflow occurs in the `Q_DecCoordOnUnitSphere` function within `bifs/unquantize.c` at line 298.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is an integer overflow. Specifically, a shift exponent is too large for a 32-bit integer, causing undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This integer overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file. An attacker can provide a specially crafted `poc.zip` file containing the malicious input that causes the integer overflow when processed by `MP4Box`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file (poc file) to be processed by the vulnerable application. Local access is required for this attack.
