**Improvements?**

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where remote updater would read the entire update into memory, leading to potential out of memory errors when updating the core.
* Fixed error when setting global calendar permissions in the Dashboard.
* Fixed issue where reset users weren’t properly notified when logging in that their passwords needed to be changed (thanks hissy)
* Fixed: reCAPTCHA timout after 2min (thanks JeffPaetkau)
* Fixed: fatal error on upgrade french version 8.5.5 to 8.5.6, "2 plural forms instead of 3" (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed error with rich text conversation editor not working (Thanks hissy)
* Fixed issue with URLs being case sensitive in some internationalization cases (thanks dimger)
* Fixes to topic attribute search index content (thanks hissy)
* Maintenance mode now returns the 503 HTTP error code when running (thanks hissy)
* Fix Call to a member function isDefault() on null" error on the site upgraded from 5.7 when using the migration tool (thanks hissy)
* Fixed issue where rich text attribute type wasn’t showing a full toolbar (note: in the future we want to make this an option, and strongly recommend users use this smaller, sanitized toolbar – but it should be an option, not the default.)
* If a file has a password in the file manager, you will not be able to view it inline in the rich text editor.
* Fixed: Changing database charset in dashboard throws error: call to a member function add() on null (thanks myq)

## Library Updates

* Bump CKEditor from 4.16.1 to 4.16.2 (thanks hissy)

## Security Fixes

* Fixed CVE-2021-22966 - Privilege escalation from Editor to Admin using Groups in Concrete CMS versions 8.5.6 and below. If a group is granted "view" permissions on the bulkupdate page, then users in that group can escalate to being an administrator with a specially crafted curl. Fixed by adding a bulk update permission security check. Concrete CMS Security team CVSS scoring: 7.1 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H Credit for discovery: Adrian Tiron from [FORTBRIDGE](https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/) This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-40101: Admin users must now provide their password when changing another user’s password from the Dashboard.Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 6.4 AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Credit for discovery: "S1lky”. This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22968: A bypass of adding remote files in Concrete CMS File manager lead to remote code execution. We added a check for the allowed file extensions before downloading files to a tmp directory. Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N Thanks both Joe and Adrian Tiron from [FORTBRIDGE](https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/)for reporting! This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22951: “Unauthorized individuals could view password protected files using view\_inline”. Concrete CMS now checks to see if a file has a password in view\_inline and if it does we don’t render the file. Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 5.3 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N Credit for discovery: "Solar Security Research Team". This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* FixedCVE-2021-40107: Stored XSS in comment section/FileManger via "view\_inline" option.Thanks "Solar Security Research Team". We now check to see if a file has a password in view\_inline and, if it does, we don’t render the file. Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 5.3: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22967: insecure indirect object reference (IDOR); an unauthenticated user was able to access restricted files by attaching them to a message in a conversation. To remediate this, we added a check to see if a user has permissions to view files before attaching the files to a message in "add / edit message”. The Concrete CMS security team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 4.3 AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N Thanks Adrian H for reporting! This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22969 : SSRF mitigation bypass using DNS Rebind attack giving an attacker the ability to fetch cloud IAAS (ex AWS) IAM keys. To fix this, Concrete CMS no longer allows downloads from the local network and specifies the validated IP when downloading rather than relying on DNS. The Concrete CMS team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N . Discoverer: Adrian Tiron from [FORTBRIDGE](https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/) Please note that Cloud IAAS provider mis-configurations are not Concrete CMS vulnerabilities. A mitigation for this vulnerability is to make sure that the IMDS configurations are according to a cloud provider's best practices. This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22970: Concrete allowed local IP importing causing the system to be vulnerable to a. SSRF attacks on the private LAN servers and b. SSRF Mitigation Bypass through DNS Rebinding. Concrete now disables all local IPs through the remote file uploading interface. Concrete CMS security team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N This CVE is shared with HackerOne Reports #1364797 (Thanks Adrian Tiron from [FORTBRIDGE](https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/) and #1360016 (Thanks Bipul Jaiswal) This fix is also in Concrete v 9.0.1
