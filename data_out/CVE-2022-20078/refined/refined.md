- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using a shared resource without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition in the `vow` component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the race condition can lead to memory corruption and privilege escalation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the race condition, which requires local access and System execution privileges, although user interaction is not needed.
