  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation of the 'pin_host' parameter within the WPS settings of the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind command injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulation of the 'pin_host' parameter within the router's WPS settings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the router's management interface to modify the 'pin_host' parameter."
