RHSA-2017:0177 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-01-19
Updated:
2017-01-19
# RHSA-2017:0177 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.6.0-sun security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

An update for java-1.6.0-sun is now available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 6 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update upgrades Oracle Java SE 6 to version 6 Update 141.

Security Fix(es):

* This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-5546, CVE-2016-5548, CVE-2016-5552, CVE-2017-3231, CVE-2017-3241, CVE-2017-3252, CVE-2017-3253, CVE-2017-3259, CVE-2017-3261, CVE-2017-3272)

This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by adding 3DES cipher suites to the list of legacy algorithms (defined using the jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms security property) so they are only used if connecting TLS/SSL client and server do not share any other non-legacy cipher suite.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for this update to take effect.
