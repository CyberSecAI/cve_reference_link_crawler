- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Otter Blocks plugin does not properly sanitize the `mainHeadings` attribute of its blocks before rendering them, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a post that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the post, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Contributor+ role can insert malicious code into the `mainHeading` attribute of an Otter Blocks review block in a post. The XSS is triggered when the post is viewed or previewed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least Contributor role on the WordPress site to create or edit posts.
