{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the injection of malicious scripts into the application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low complexity (AC:L) and a user with low privileges (PR:L), and relies on the victim's interaction with a malicious script (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C) due to the stored nature of the XSS.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts and have a user interact with that script, implying the attacker needs to have low privileged access to inject and a victim to interact with the injected script within the application."
