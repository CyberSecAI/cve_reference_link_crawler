Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization for the `$location_x` and `$location_y` parameters within the `tpl_kaoqin_locationchange.html` file. These parameters are directly inserted into a JavaScript context within the `qq.maps.LatLng()` constructor without proper escaping, allowing for injection of malicious code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected JavaScript code executes in the context of the victim's browser when they load the vulnerable page, which is `tpl_kaoqin_locationchange.html`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
        *   Stealing session cookies.
        *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        *   Modifying the content of the web page.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user within the application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include the malicious JavaScript code in the `location_x` and/or `location_y` parameters. The vulnerable page `tpl_kaoqin_locationchange.html` is accessed via a HTTP GET request, so the URL parameters will be reflected in the response.
    *   Example URLs provided:
        *   `http(s)://ip:port/?a=locationchange&m=kaoqin&d=main&location_y=118.167806&scale=12&callback=backshow1717123083601_5578&location_x=);alert(document.cookie);%3C!--`
        *   `http(s)://ip:port/?a=locationchange&m=kaoqin&d=main&location_y=);alert(document.cookie);%3C!--&scale=12&callback=backshow1717123083601_5578&location_y=118.167806`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send URLs to victims. This could be done through social engineering, phishing, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject the malicious URL.
    *   The attacker doesn't need any specific position within the network. They just need a way to have a victim open a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `Xinhu RockOA v2.6.3`.
*   The vulnerable code is located at `xinhu/webmain/main/kaoqin/tpl_kaoqin_locationchange.html#L21`
*   The specific vulnerable lines of code are: `var center = new qq.maps.LatLng(<?=$location_x?>,<?=$location_y?>);`
