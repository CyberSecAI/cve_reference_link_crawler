- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack buffer within the handling of the AppChargingControl BLE command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow. Insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability via the BLE interface. Although authentication is required, the authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be network-adjacent and able to send malicious BLE commands. They must also be able to bypass the authentication mechanism.
