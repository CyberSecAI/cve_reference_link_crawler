- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An overly restrictive account lockout mechanism in KNX devices using KNX Connection Authorization Option 1, where the BCU key can be set, and the device cannot be reset without the existing key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Overly restrictive account lockout mechanism (CWE-645).
    - Lack of a secure method to reset the BCU key.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Loss of access to the device.
    - Potential inability to reset the device.
    - Denial of service through device lockout.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remotely over the network if the device is network-connected.
    - Physically, if the attacker has physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the KNX installation.
    - Physical access to the device.
    - Ability to interface with the KNX installation.
