Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for a previous command injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-24433). The initial fix only addressed the `git fetch` command but did not account for the `--upload-pack` option being used with the `git clone` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Argument Injection:** The `simple-git` library fails to properly sanitize user-provided arguments when executing `git clone` commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious arguments, specifically using `--upload-pack` to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Incomplete Patching:** The previous vulnerability fix did not cover all potential attack vectors using the `--upload-pack` option, leaving `git clone` vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application that uses the vulnerable version of `simple-git`. This can lead to:
  - **Confidentiality Loss:** Accessing sensitive data.
  - **Integrity Loss:** Modifying system files.
  - **Availability Loss:** Causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `simple-git` library is used to perform a `git clone` operation and attacker-controlled arguments are passed to the command, particularly using the `--upload-pack` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the `simple-git` library's `clone` function.
- No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack is remotely exploitable.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in versions of `simple-git` prior to 3.5.0 and `org.webjars.npm:simple-git` prior to 3.14.0.
- The exploit involves passing a malicious `--upload-pack` argument within the `git clone` command.
- Example exploit:
  ```javascript
  const simpleGit = require('simple-git')
  const git2 = simpleGit()
  git2.clone('file:///tmp/zero123', '/tmp/example-new-repo', ['--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn']);
  ```
  This code, when run, would create a file named `/tmp/pwn`.

**Mitigation:**

- Upgrade `simple-git` to version 3.5.0 or higher.
- Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:simple-git` to version 3.14.0 or higher.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.1 (High) by Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) by NVD.
- The exploit has a proof of concept available.
- The vulnerability is a type of argument injection, specifically related to improper neutralization of argument delimiters.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-88.
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in commit `2040de601c894363050fef9f28af367b169a56c5` in the `git-js` repository.
