- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zabbix frontend allows HTML code to be inserted into the "Attribution text" field of the geomap configuration when the "Other" tile provider is selected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization/lack of input sanitization in the "Attribution text" field, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious code injected into the "Attribution text" field is executed when a user views the map, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can inject malicious HTML code into the "Attribution text" field within the geomap configuration under "Administration → General → Geographical maps". The malicious code is then executed when a user views a map utilizing the configured geomap.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to configure geomaps in the Zabbix frontend (likely requiring administrative privileges) to inject malicious HTML code.
