Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Byobu extension for Flarum handles user preferences related to blocking private discussions. Specifically, the extension did not properly respect a user's setting to prevent others from initiating private discussions with them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce user-defined preferences for blocking private discussions. This allows unauthorized actions to occur, violating the intended access control mechanism.
- **Logic Error:** The code logic incorrectly evaluated user's block setting, which allowed bypassing the check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Users can initiate private discussions with other users who have explicitly chosen to block such interactions.
- **Unwanted Communication:** Users might receive unwanted messages or communication from other users they intended to block.
- **Low Severity:** According to the provided information, the severity is considered low, with a CVSS score of 3.5

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote (logically and physically).
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with low privileges.
- **User Interaction Required**: The attacker needs to interact with the application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege User Account:**  The attacker must have an account on the affected Flarum forum.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the username of the user to bypass privacy settings.
- **Basic Forum Interaction:** The attacker interacts with the standard functionality of the forum.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Byobu version 1.1.7.
- The fix was implemented by correctly checking the user's preference.
- There are no known workarounds other than upgrading.
- The patched version requires Flarum Core v1.2.0 or later.
