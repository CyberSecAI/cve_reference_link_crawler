The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-24400.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A flaw exists in the TETRA authentication algorithm that allows attackers to set the Derived Cypher Key (DCK) to 0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the authentication algorithm of the TETRA standard, specifically in how the DCK is handled.
- Attackers can manipulate the authentication process to force the DCK to be zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Loss of authenticity**: Setting the DCK to 0 compromises the integrity of communications, because it affects the session key generation.
- **Partial loss of confidentiality**: Since the key generation is affected it may also have a partial impact on confidentiality.
- The vulnerability does *not* allow for full man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- Allows for uplink interception.
- Allows access to post-authentication protocol functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is active. This means the attacker actively needs to manipulate the communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to actively interact with the TETRA network to exploit the vulnerability.
