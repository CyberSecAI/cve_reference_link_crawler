The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1065.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the authentication process of Abacus ERP software, specifically in how multi-factor authentication (MFA) is handled. The backend does not validate the MFA status, relying solely on the frontend.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **MFA bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the second factor authentication.
- **Frontend validation:** The verification of the MFA request is only performed on the frontend of the application and not on the backend.
- **Missing backend verification:** The lack of backend verification allows an attacker to skip the MFA status check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** An attacker with a valid username/password can gain full access to the system without needing to complete the MFA process.
- **Weakened security:** Bypassing MFA significantly reduces the overall security of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed over the network by sending a series of crafted HTTP requests to the web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials (username/password) for a user on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker doesn't need to interact with the user's mobile device or intercept any communication.
