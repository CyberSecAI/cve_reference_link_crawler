- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient security configuration in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to resources outside the web UI's filesystem mountpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain read access to files outside of the web UI's designated filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and can be remote.
