*\*Note: Product list table contents subject to change.*

*\*\* Note: Users of Autodesk Advance Steel, Autodesk Civil 3D, and the specialized toolsets of AutoCAD need to install either the AutoCAD product update(s) listed above or a more recent product version. These security fixes are not included in the updates specific to individual toolsets.*

*\*\*\* Note: Users of Map 3D 2022 need both AutoCAD 2022.1.2 and the Map 3D 2022.0.2 updates.*

### Recommendations

Autodesk recommends that customers using the affected products listed above should apply the available hotfix via the Autodesk Desktop App or the[Accounts Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/).

An update is not available for 32bit AutoCAD 2019. Customers using this version should plan to upgrade to 64bit AutoCAD 2019 or a newer AutoCAD version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/dwg-trueview/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Where-to-download-previous-versions-of-DWG-TrueView.html)for more information on DWG^TM^ TrueView about previous version support.

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the [Autodesk forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/previous-version-support/bd-p/6051) for more information about previous version support.
