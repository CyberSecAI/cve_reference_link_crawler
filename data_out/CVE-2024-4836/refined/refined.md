Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4836

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within Edito CMS, allowing unauthorized users to download sensitive configuration files and other local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties:**  The core weakness is that the web services managed by Edito CMS do not properly restrict access to configuration files and other local files, allowing external users to retrieve them without proper authorization. This could lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  An attacker can download configuration files, which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials (login details). This can potentially lead to a complete compromise of the web application and the data it manages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through direct web requests to download configuration files or other local files. The specific paths and filenames are not provided in the content, but the vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to retrieve these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges. They only need to send specific web requests to access these files.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Edito CMS web server.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- Edito CMS versions 3.5 through 3.25 are affected.
- Versions released after January 10, 2014 are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor provides a modified configuration template to disable access to sensitive files. Applying this template would mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska, who coordinated the disclosure.
- The issue was resolved in releases after January 10, 2014.
