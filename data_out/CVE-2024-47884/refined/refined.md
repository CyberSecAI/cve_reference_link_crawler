The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47884.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `foxmarks` handles temporary files when copying the Firefox database. It creates a temporary file in the `/tmp` directory to copy the Firefox database to, but after copying the database, it's permissions are copied with it resulting in an insecure file with `0o644` permissions, instead of the default `0o600` for `NamedTempFile`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Temporary File creation: The application uses `NamedTempFile` to create a temporary file in `/tmp` but does not ensure that it maintains secure permissions after the file copy.
- Copying file permissions: The `std::fs::copy` operation copies the file's content as well as permissions, inheriting the original database file's `0o644` permissions. This results in the temporary file being readable by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data: A malicious user can read the temporary copy of Firefox's database containing bookmarks, history, input history, visit counters, use counters, view counters, and other potentially confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where `foxmarks` is running.
- Execution of `foxmarks` commands: The vulnerability is triggered when the targeted user executes `foxmarks bookmarks` or `foxmarks history`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privilege access: The attacker requires low privilege access to the system.
- No user interaction required: No user interaction is needed besides running vulnerable commands by the targeted user.
