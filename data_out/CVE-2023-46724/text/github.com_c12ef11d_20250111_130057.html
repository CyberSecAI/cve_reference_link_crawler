# SQUID-2023:4 Denial of Service in SSL Certificate validation

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-73m6-jm96-c6r3
Nov 1, 2023

## Package

squid

## Affected versions

3.3.0.1-5.9, 6.0-6.3

## Patched versions

6.4

## Description

Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index

bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack against SSL Certificate validation.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of

Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with

a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate

chain.

This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump.

CVSS Score of 8.6

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.4.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_4.patch>

#### Squid 6:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_4.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid older than 3.3.0.1 are not vulnerable.

All Squid-3.3 up to and including 3.4.14 compiled without

--enable-ssl are not vulnerable.

All Squid-3.3 up to and including 3.4.14 compiled using

--enable-ssl are vulnerable.

All Squid-3.5 up to and including 3.5.28 compiled without

--with-openssl are not vulnerable.

All Squid-3.5 up to and including 3.5.28 compiled using

--with-openssl are vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.16 compiled without

--with-openssl are not vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.16 compiled using

--with-openssl are vulnerable.

Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 compiled without

--with-openssl are not vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 compiled using

--with-openssl are vulnerable.

All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.3 compiled without

--with-openssl are not vulnerable.

All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.3 compiled using

--with-openssl are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

Either,

Disable use of SSL-Bump features:

* Remove all ssl-bump options from http\_port and https\_port
* Remove all ssl\_bump directives from squid.conf

Or,

Rebuild Squid using --without-openssl.

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
