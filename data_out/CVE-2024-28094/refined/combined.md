# Learning and engagement made easy for K–12 schools

A single platform to connect, communicate, and collaborate with parents, teachers, students, and your broader school community.

Schoolbox is a platform to support the development of the whole student; their academic growth, extracurricular involvement and wellbeing.

"Schoolbox is an interactive environment for collaboration over resources. It's a connection point for staff, students and parents."

Judy Burriss, Director of ICT, Toorak College

"Schoolbox was selected because it is easy to use, has a powerful content management system and is support by a company that shares our passion for education."

Richard Jones, IT Manager, Shore School

"Schoolbox provides an online environment that is extensively customisable to meet the College branding, extends and enhances the learning opportunities for students and facilitates numerous communications approaches to keep our families informed."

Brett Bastian, Director of ICT, Genazzano FCJ College

learning management in schoolbox

## Understanding an LMS

Where we’re faced with a generation of learners with readily available information, easy access and a connected lifestyle, the learning experience needs to equip these students with skills to transform knowledge into wisdom. Having a learning management system (LMS) in schools is the first step to giving teachers the tools they need to optimise their teaching strategies and enhance the learning experience of K–12 students in the 21st century.

The Schoolbox LMS is designed with the modern learner in mind.

## Engaging Parents and Students

The digital age has given our learners the ability to access information readily and instantaneously. So, imagine the learning experience when vital elements like communication and collaboration are extended beyond the classroom.

Schoolbox recognises these advantages for today’s K–12 learners and on top of the Learning Management System, we also provide teachers with a School Portal solution to keep their students connected even after the bell has rung.
