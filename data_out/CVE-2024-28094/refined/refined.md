Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The chat functionality in Schoolbox application versions prior to 23.1.3 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This indicates a lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** This type of SQL injection doesn't directly display the results of the injected query in the application's response. Instead, attackers infer information by observing changes in the application's behavior or timing. This makes it harder to detect but still exploitable.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Parameterization:** The application fails to properly handle user-provided data in the chat feature before using it in SQL queries, opening the door for injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Read Database Records:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially including user information, personal details, and system configurations.
*   **Modify Database Records:** Attackers can alter data stored in the database, leading to data corruption, manipulation of application functionality, or defacement.
*   **Delete Database Records:** Attackers can remove records from the database, causing data loss and potential disruption to the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is the **chat functionality** of the Schoolbox application.
*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the chat interface which will then be processed by the applicationâ€™s backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers must have an authenticated account within the Schoolbox application to access the chat functionality and exploit this vulnerability. This indicates that the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Akshay Raj, on behalf of The Missing Link Security.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 23.1.3 of Schoolbox application.
