{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `skip` function within the `parse_data` functionality. This function, when processing list properties, calls `read_property_ascii` with a `listSize` value initialized to 0. When the input stream does not contain data, the `ply_read_ascii` call within does not modify `listSize`, leaving it at 0. This leads to a zero-sized buffer being allocated in a later step of `read`. Subsequently, when `parse_data` is called for the second time to populate the data, it does not validate the buffer size, causing a heap buffer overflow due to writing data into the zero-sized buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)",
    "Lack of input validation (specifically, failing to check if the istream extraction was successful in `skip` function)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the heap buffer overflow. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain control over the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted .ply file. An attacker can provide a malicious .ply file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of libigl.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .ply file to a vulnerable application that uses libigl. The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position or perform any authentication."
