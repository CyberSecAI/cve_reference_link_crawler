Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24867:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ldap_pass` variable, containing the LDAP password, was not being filtered out when configuration data was passed to JavaScript. This exposed the password in the page's source code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The LDAP password was unintentionally included in the configuration data exposed in the HTML source code, leading to a plaintext password exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who views the source code of a GLPI page can obtain the LDAP password.
- This password can be used to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP server, potentially compromising user accounts and sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to access the source code of any page on a vulnerable GLPI instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the web page of a vulnerable GLPI installation. No special user privileges are required to view source code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability existed in GLPI versions prior to 10.0.0.
- The fix involved adding `ldap_pass` to the list of filtered fields in the `Config.php` file.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Low" severity
- The vulnerable code is located in `src/Html.php` (line 1652 & 6343) and `src/Config.php` (line 3711), where the configuration variables are populated and filtered.
- The report includes a dump of the GLPI setup information, showing the plaintext LDAP password.
- The advisory is tracked under GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-4r49-52q9-5fgr`.
