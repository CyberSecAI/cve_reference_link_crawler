Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-2902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling D3D9 shader objects in Oracle VirtualBox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists, where data is written past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current VirtualBox process. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, requiring the victim to interact with malicious content.
- User interaction is needed; the victim must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to create a malicious page or file that exploits the D3D9 shader object handling flaw. They do not need to be authenticated, but they need to trick the user into interacting with the malicious content.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported by "anhdaden of STAR Labs" through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Oracle issued an update to correct this vulnerability as part of their April 2020 Critical Patch Update.
