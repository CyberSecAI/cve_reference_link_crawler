Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4085

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Tabellen von faustball.com" WordPress plugin's admin settings. User-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being stored, and not properly escaped when output to the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before saving it to the database or using it to generate content. Specifically, the code was using `sanitize_text_field` but not escaping output of the values when rendered in HTML.
- **Missing Output Escaping:**  The plugin is not using `esc_textarea` to escape user-provided values, which are used to render form elements, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Injection:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** When a user (potentially another admin or a visitor if the settings are output somewhere visible) accesses a page where the injected script is rendered, the script will execute in their browser.
- **Potential Account Takeover/Malicious Actions:** The attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies/session data, redirecting to malicious websites, or performing administrative tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Settings:**  The vulnerability is located within the plugin's admin settings page, making it accessible to logged-in users with the necessary permissions.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when the page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with administrator-level permissions or higher.
- **Access to Admin Settings:** The attacker must have access to the admin area where the plugin's settings are configured.
- **Multi-site Installations or `unfiltered_html` Disabled:** The vulnerability primarily impacts multi-site installations or those where unfiltered\_html is disabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was fixed by changing the output of the admin form fields. In particular, the fix replaced the double tildes `~~` around `sanitize_text_field` with `esc_textarea`.
*   The vulnerable versions of the plugin are up to and including 2.0.4.
*   The patched version of the plugin is 2.1.0.
* The changelog entry indicates this patch was intended as a security fix and included "Additional measures against XSS".

In summary, the vulnerability allows an authenticated administrator to inject malicious scripts through the admin panel due to the plugin not properly escaping values from database before rendering the page. This results in stored XSS that can be used to perform malicious actions.
