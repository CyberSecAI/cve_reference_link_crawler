- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The wp-mpdf plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website, which will be executed when users visit the site. This could lead to various consequences, including user redirection, unauthorized actions, and potentially further compromise of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious scripts via user inputs. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no login is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or credentials. The attack can be performed remotely.
