Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the missing "gcing" flag on pages during block migration in the F2FS filesystem. This flag is necessary to ensure that migrated data is correctly persisted during checkpoint operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Flag:** The core issue is the omission of the `set_page_private_gcing` call when migrating data blocks. This omission leads to pages not being marked for garbage collection (gcing) during migration.
- **Out-of-Order Persistency:**  Without the gcing flag, there's a risk of out-of-order persistency between data and metadata (nodes) during checkpoints. This means the metadata might be updated to reflect the migration before the data has been fully written to storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Corruption:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is data corruption. If a system experiences a sudden power off reset (SPOR) after a block migration, but before the data is fully persisted, the inconsistency between the migrated data and the updated node information can lead to a corrupted filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Block Migration:** The vulnerability is triggered by operations involving block migration, such as defragmentation or compression.
- **Unclean Shutdown:** Exploitation involves triggering a system crash or power loss after block migration but before the checkpoint operation completes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **System User:**  The attacker would need to have the ability to initiate actions that lead to block migrations on a F2FS volume (e.g., by triggering defragmentation or compression).
- **Unclean Shutdown Trigger:** The attacker needs to have the ability to cause an unclean shutdown (e.g., power loss) at a specific time, after the migration operation, but prior to the checkpoint completing. This may not require any special access for a local attacker.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code diffs show the fix implemented:
- The `set_page_private_gcing` function is called alongside `set_page_dirty` within the `set_cluster_dirty` function (fs/f2fs/compress.c).
- The `set_page_private_gcing` function is also called alongside `set_page_dirty` in `__clone_blkaddrs` and `redirty_blocks` functions (fs/f2fs/file.c).
- The patches ensure that when a page is dirtied during block migration, it's also marked for garbage collection, which is needed to ensure all data related to that change is persisted to storage before it's considered committed by F2FS.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability is a data corruption issue caused by a missing flag during F2FS block migration. The fix involves adding `set_page_private_gcing` to ensure data consistency and prevent potential data loss after an unexpected system reset. This is a classic case of a race condition between data and metadata.
