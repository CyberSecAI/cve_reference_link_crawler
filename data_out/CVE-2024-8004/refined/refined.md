  "cveId": "CVE-2024-8004",
  "description": "A stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator from Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2022x through Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2024x allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in user's browser session.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, which allows malicious script code to be injected into the application's database. When this data is retrieved and displayed to other users, the injected script is executed in their browser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in a victim's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web page, or other malicious actions.",
    "attackVectors": "The attacker injects malicious script code into a field or data within the ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator application. When another user views the page/data containing the malicious script, their browser executes the code.",
     "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to input data into the affected application. This might be achieved with standard user permissions to add or edit items."
