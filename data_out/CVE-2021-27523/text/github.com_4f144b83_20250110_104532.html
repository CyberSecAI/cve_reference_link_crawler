### **[testivy](/testivy)** commented [Feb 18, 2021](#issue-810996702)

| Dear Author, I’m testivy. I found that the latest version 0.2.0 of falcon dashboard has a bypass problem of the registeration.As the link below: <http://book.open-falcon.com/en_0_2/quick_install/frontend.html#dashboard-user-management> when we try to change the value of item "signup\_disable" to "true" in the API configuration file "cfg.json" then reboot API for a purpose to restrict the register function meaning that this is only for "sign in" not for "sign up". I found in the code that I can bypass it under the "/auth/register " interface. In this condition, I can bypass the registeration restriction and do as below: Call the user added interface and add a new user (POST `https://127.0.0.1:8081/auth/register name=test&cnname=test&email=test@test.cn&password=xxx&repeat_password=xxx`), then use the newly added account to log in to the dashboard for viewing ,modifing, and adding .  **Vulnerability details** This problem mainly occurs in `_dashboard/rrd/view/auth/auth.py_`  ``` @app.route("/auth/register", methods=["GET", "POST"]) def auth_register():     if request.method == "GET":         if g.user:             return redirect("/auth/login")         return render_template("auth/register.html", **locals())      if request.method == "POST":         ret = {"msg":""}          name = request.form.get("name", "").strip()         cnname = request.form.get("cnname", "").strip()         email = request.form.get("email", "").strip()         password = request.form.get("password", "")         repeat_password = request.form.get("repeat_password", "")   ```  As we can see, the above if branches: in **if request.method == "GET"** will judge the g.user otherwise redirect to "/auth/login" ,But when the request.method == "POST",the system will get request param to add a account by "name,cnname,email,password and repeat\_password" to the backend. Under the certain circumstances,we can directly call the "auth/register" interface with post method to add a new user.  **Loopholes Reproduce** 1.`curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8081/auth/register' --data 'name=test&cnname=test&email=test%40test.cn&password=test1234&repeat_password=test1234'` As we can see, register restriction has been bypassed and a new account has been added to the dashboard management without logging in. The response is as below: {`"msg":""}`  2.View the console [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13583188/108346350-3e9b1880-721a-11eb-91e3-6ac06f5da827.png)  Visit the index page <http://127.0.0.1:8081/>, then log in to the new account, and you will can do anything.  Best Regards |
