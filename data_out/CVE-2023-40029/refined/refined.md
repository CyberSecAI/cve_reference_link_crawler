Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-40029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way Argo CD manages cluster secrets. When a cluster secret is created or updated using `kubectl apply`, the full secret body, including potentially sensitive information, is stored in the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation.  A feature introduced in PR #7139 allowed the management of cluster labels and annotations, which inadvertently exposed this annotation when retrieving cluster details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation stores the full secret body, which can include sensitive data such as bearer tokens used for authentication.
*   **Insecure handling of annotations:** ArgoCD did not filter out the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation when retrieving cluster details via the API.
*   **RBAC dependency:** Access to the sensitive information was only restricted by the `clusters, get` RBAC permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** An attacker with `clusters, get` RBAC access could retrieve the full content of cluster secrets, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Leaked authentication tokens could be used to gain unauthorized access to the targeted Kubernetes clusters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API access:** An attacker with the `clusters, get` RBAC permission can use the Argo CD API to retrieve cluster details, including the vulnerable annotation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to Argo CD.
*   **Authorization:** The attacker must have the `clusters, get` RBAC permission in Argo CD.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced with the implementation of PR #7139, which added support for labels and annotations to cluster secrets.
*   The fix involves preventing the display and editing of the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation through the API and ensuring that this annotation is dropped when converting secrets to cluster objects.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.9, indicating a critical severity.
*   The vulnerability affects Argo CD versions 2.2.0 through 2.6.14, 2.7.113, and 2.8.2.
*   Patched versions include 2.8.3, 2.7.14, and 2.6.15.

This vulnerability highlights a case where a seemingly benign feature (managing cluster labels and annotations) inadvertently introduced a security risk due to the way Kubernetes stores applied configurations.
