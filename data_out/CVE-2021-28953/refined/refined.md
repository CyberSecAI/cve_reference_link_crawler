Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the C/C++ Advanced Lint extension for VS Code's behavior of executing third-party command-line tools based on configurations set in the workspace. This allows a malicious workspace to specify arbitrary executables to run.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension does not sufficiently restrict the source of configuration settings for the linting tools. It allows workspace settings to override user settings without proper validation.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to configure the executable paths for the linter tools opens a path for attackers to execute their own malicious binaries on the victim's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, allowing the attacker to potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Workspace:** An attacker can create a malicious workspace that contains specially crafted configuration settings for the C/C++ Advanced Lint extension.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the victim to open the malicious workspace folder in VS Code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious workspace folder.
- The attacker must trick the victim into opening the crafted workspace in VS Code.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.0 of the extension, and upgrading to this version or higher is the recommended mitigation.
- The extension now defaults to reading settings from user settings to mitigate risk.
- There is a "Toggle Workspace Trust Flag" command which can be used to indicate trusted workspaces that can use workspace settings.
- The extension's documentation explicitly highlights the security risk of using workspace settings and the potential to run arbitrary binaries, if a random repository is opened.
