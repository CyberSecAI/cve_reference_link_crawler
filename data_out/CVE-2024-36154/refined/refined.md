Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE-2024-36154:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). The vulnerability is due to the application not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before storing it, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79). The application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data which is later displayed in a web page.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. If an attacker successfully injects and stores malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed when other users view the page, leading to potential compromise of their sessions, or malicious actions performed on their behalf.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. The attacker can inject malicious code remotely into the system through a vulnerable input field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to insert malicious scripts into the application. The CVSS vector indicates that a low-privileged user can perform the attack by convincing a user to trigger it (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C)
