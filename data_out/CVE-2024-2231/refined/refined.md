- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization check on a function that allows any authenticated user to join a private group.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that leads to broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a subscriber level account can join private groups without proper authorization.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `wpqa_accept_invite` and a `group_id` parameter. This can be performed by making a request from the developer console of the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber or higher level user with an authenticated session to exploit this vulnerability.
