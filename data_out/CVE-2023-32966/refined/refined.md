- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Jazz Popups plugin, in versions 1.8.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted request, typically by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while they are still logged into the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into executing it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
