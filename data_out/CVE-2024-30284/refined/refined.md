Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-30284:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Use After Free (CWE-416)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free error. This occurs when an application attempts to use memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the affected system, leading to full control of the system.
*  **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L), and no privileges are required(PR:N) but user interaction(UI:R) is needed for exploitation, and the vulnerability scope is unchanged (S:U).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs user interaction to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file).

The document also provides CVSS v3.1 vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` and a base score of 7.8. The document confirms the vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC on Windows and macOS.
