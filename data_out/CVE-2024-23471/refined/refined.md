Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-23471:

**Vulnerability:** SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) CreateFile Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the CreateFile function of the SolarWinds Access Rights Manager.
*   **Weakness:** The software improperly handles file paths, allowing for directory traversal. This allows a malicious user to specify file locations outside the intended directory by manipulating path inputs.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the ARM application. This grants them the ability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to complete system compromise and potential for data theft, service disruption, or further malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack involves exploiting the `CreateFile` functionality by providing a crafted file path that traverses directories, enabling the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information comes from the release notes for SolarWinds Access Rights Manager version 2024.3.
* This vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.6.
* The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by an anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
