- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free (CWE-416)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe Aero.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires user interaction (UI:R) but no privileges (PR:N) to trigger the vulnerability. The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
