sctp: use call\_rcu to free endpoint[ Upstream commit 5ec7d18d1813a5bead0b495045606c93873aecbb ]This patch is to delay the endpoint free by calling call\_rcu() to fixanother use-after-free issue in sctp\_sock\_dump(): BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in \_\_lock\_acquire+0x36d9/0x4c20 Call Trace: \_\_lock\_acquire+0x36d9/0x4c20 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3218 lock\_acquire+0x1ed/0x520 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3844 \_\_raw\_spin\_lock\_bh include/linux/spinlock\_api\_smp.h:135 [inline] \_raw\_spin\_lock\_bh+0x31/0x40 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:168 spin\_lock\_bh include/linux/spinlock.h:334 [inline] \_\_lock\_sock+0x203/0x350 net/core/sock.c:2253 lock\_sock\_nested+0xfe/0x120 net/core/sock.c:2774 lock\_sock include/net/sock.h:1492 [inline] sctp\_sock\_dump+0x122/0xb20 net/sctp/diag.c:324 sctp\_for\_each\_transport+0x2b5/0x370 net/sctp/socket.c:5091 sctp\_diag\_dump+0x3ac/0x660 net/sctp/diag.c:527 \_\_inet\_diag\_dump+0xa8/0x140 net/ipv4/inet\_diag.c:1049 inet\_diag\_dump+0x9b/0x110 net/ipv4/inet\_diag.c:1065 netlink\_dump+0x606/0x1080 net/netlink/af\_netlink.c:2244 \_\_netlink\_dump\_start+0x59a/0x7c0 net/netlink/af\_netlink.c:2352 netlink\_dump\_start include/linux/netlink.h:216 [inline] inet\_diag\_handler\_cmd+0x2ce/0x3f0 net/ipv4/inet\_diag.c:1170 \_\_sock\_diag\_cmd net/core/sock\_diag.c:232 [inline] sock\_diag\_rcv\_msg+0x31d/0x410 net/core/sock\_diag.c:263 netlink\_rcv\_skb+0x172/0x440 net/netlink/af\_netlink.c:2477 sock\_diag\_rcv+0x2a/0x40 net/core/sock\_diag.c:274This issue occurs when asoc is peeled off and the old sk is freed aftergetting it by asoc->base.sk and before calling lock\_sock(sk).To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive whencalling lock\_sock(). This patch uses call\_rcu() and moves sock\_put andep free into sctp\_endpoint\_destroy\_rcu(), so that it's safe to try tohold the ep under rcu\_read\_lock in sctp\_transport\_traverse\_process().If sctp\_endpoint\_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still aliveand we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu\_read\_unlock, andwe should skip it.In sctp\_sock\_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different fromtsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled offbefore calling lock\_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep isthe same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,and due to lock\_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release\_sock.Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as theport release happens in sctp\_endpoint\_destroy() before calling call\_rcu().Also, freeing endpoint by call\_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk byasoc->base.sk in sctp\_assocs\_seq\_show() and sctp\_rcv().Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.v1->v2: - improve the changelog. - add kfree(ep) into sctp\_endpoint\_destroy\_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.Reported-by: syzbot+9276d76e83e3bcde6c99@syzkaller.appspotmail.comReported-by: Lee Jones Fixes: d25adbeb0cdb ("sctp: fix an use-after-free issue in sctp\_sock\_dump")Signed-off-by: Xin Long Signed-off-by: David S.
