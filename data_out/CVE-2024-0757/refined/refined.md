- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper filtering of file extensions allowed to be imported, enabling the upload of malicious code within zip files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the plugin fails to prevent the upload of PHP code in a phar archive within a ZIP file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a malicious zip file containing a PHP-based phar archive via the e-Learning block in a WordPress post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with the capability to create and edit posts ('Author+' role). The attacker needs to upload a specially crafted zip file containing a phar archive.
