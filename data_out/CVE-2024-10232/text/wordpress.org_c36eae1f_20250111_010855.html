Atomchat is by far the best Chat app in the market today. I have been using Atomchat for 2 years and I have nothing but good things to say about the product and the support team. Yes, the best part about Atomchat is their support, admin and technical. They really go out of their way to make sure you are getting the best out of their product. Management and support engineers are worldclass, very professional and knowledgeable. I reccommend Atomchat 100%.

コメットチャット代替の選択肢としても、ウェブサイトへのグルチャ導入としても、少なくともスモールビジネス向けには最右翼だと思います。
年間５万で必要にして十分なこの機能は価格破壊レベルです。
１２万ほどでスマホアプリもご提供いただけるとか、日本では０がいくつ増えるのかと。
デフォルトでは日本語対応が今ひとつですが、開発陣にはざっと訳したデータを提供したので、徐々に日本語環境への対応も進んでいくと思います。文字あふれなどもカスタムcssの機能があり手元で対応可能、見た目のカスタマイズ性についても文句なしです。
スタッフの話によればコメットチャットの一部分？からのスピンオフなようで、ソースにもその名残がみてとれます。つまり素性はよいものである、という理解です（私は）。（名称変更で直接の関わりないようです）
また、不具合に対しての対応は真摯そのものです。試用期間中でも要望に応えてくれる開発陣のその姿勢が印象的でした。
インドが拠点なようで、日本との時差があまりなくコミュニケーションが取りやすかったのもよかった。
蛇足ながら、WordPressで使うとするならBuddyPressとの相性が抜群です。実際私もそうしています。BuddyPress専用ではないために若干のクセはあるものの、私にはじゅうぶんに許容できるレベルでした（バックエンドの運用でじゅうぶんになんとかなるレベル）
あとは『何にどう使うか』のこちら側の問題にできる、そういうプラグインだと感じています。

I’ve been using Atom Chat on my Buddypress dating site for over a year now and I really like it. I have tried few other Buddypress chat plugins and either users complained about bugs or there were compatibility issues such as member avatars not displaying up which is kind of important on a dating site. I decided to try Atom Chat even though it was more pricey. I was able to negotiate a good deal for my site as my user base is smaller than their plans allow for. I have not heard any complaints about the service from my members. I even use it sometimes when members chat me with some questions although it is mainly used for member to member interactions and not support.
I use the Atom Chat in connection with PMPro membership plugin. Atom Chat allows to configure the chat visibility based on member PMPro level or whether they even have a membership level.
What stands out with Atom Chat is the option to chat via video, or voice, in addition to the regular live chat, so members don’t have to step out of the comfort zone and give out phone number or social media until they are ready, and can still see each other and talk. This is a great option for a dating community.
The chat look and feel can be modified via dashboard and the support staff was helpful to figure out some installation kinks. Overall it’s a great plugin.

Very easy to set up and use, but not being able to turn off notification sounds is a real problem, especially when embedding chat next to a live event that people are trying to listen to! There is the option to upload a custom sound file, so we tried uploading recording of 1 second of silence, but it only worked intermittently.
Tried contacting support about this multiple times, but no response. The lack of response to support requests in itself makes this not a workable solution for our event.
