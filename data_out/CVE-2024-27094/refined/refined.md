{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Base64.encode` function in OpenZeppelin Contracts iterates over the input `bytes` in 3-byte chunks. When the input length is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read memory beyond the input buffer, leading to the inclusion of potentially 'dirty' (non-zero) data in the encoded output.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of memory boundaries when processing data.",
      "Potential for reading uninitialized or unexpected memory values."
    ],
    "impact": "The encoded output can be corrupted by 'dirty' memory, where up to 4 bits of extra data may be introduced into the Base64 encoded string, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the encoded data is interpreted incorrectly.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the memory layout of contracts by placing non-zero data just after the input `bytes`.",
      "Setting a memory pointer to a non-empty memory location before allocating input."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the memory layout such that non-zero data is present immediately after the input data that is passed to the `Base64.encode` function"
