Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Cosign's unbounded loop when fetching attestations from a remote registry. Specifically, the `FetchAttestations` function iterates through all attestations returned by the registry without any limit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unbounded Loop:** Cosign loops through all attestations fetched from the remote registry, leading to a potential denial-of-service.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Limit:**  The number of attestations is not validated or limited before being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause Cosign to enter a long or infinite loop, preventing other users from verifying their data or completing their admission requests. This can also act as a rollback attack preventing upgrades by keeping Cosign stuck.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive processing of numerous attestations can consume significant resources, impacting the availability of the Cosign service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Registry:** An attacker can compromise a registry and modify it to return a large number of attestations.
- **Attacker-Controlled Registry:** An attacker can host their own registry and make a request to it, returning a large number of attestations in response to Cosign.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to either control or have the ability to manipulate a remote registry.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause Cosign to fetch attestations from the malicious registry, whether through an image reference they control or by manipulating the registry used by the organization.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system running Cosign.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `pkg/cosign/fetch.go` file in the `FetchAttestations` function.
- The fix introduces a limit (`maxAllowedSigsOrAtts`) of 100 for the maximum number of signatures or attestations that Cosign will process.
- The provided content also includes a test case (`TestExcessiveAttestations`) that validates the fix by attempting to fetch more than the allowed number of attestations and confirming that an error is returned.
- The CVSS score of 3.1 indicates a "Low" severity.

The vulnerability can be triggered when using Cosign in a context that involves fetching attestations from an untrusted registry, such as within a Kubernetes cluster using Kyverno.
