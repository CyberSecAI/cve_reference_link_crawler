The provided content details a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Eblog Blog System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the comment section of blog posts. Specifically, the `description` argument is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: Malicious JavaScript code injected into the comment is stored in the system and executed when other users view the comment/post.
- Lack of input sanitization: The system does not sanitize or encode user input, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed within a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Session hijacking: Attackers can steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- Defacement/malicious redirects: Attackers can deface the website or redirect users to malicious pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within a comment in a blog post. This can be done by crafting a POST request to the `/post/reply/` endpoint.
- When other users view the comment, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to post a comment on the blog to inject the malicious payload, which in this case is `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
- No special privileges are required. An attacker with a regular user account can exploit this vulnerability.
