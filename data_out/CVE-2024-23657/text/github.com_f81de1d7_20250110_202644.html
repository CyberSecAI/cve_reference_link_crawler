# Path Traversal: '../filedir' in Nuxt Devtools

High

[danielroe](/danielroe)
published
GHSA-rcvg-rgf7-pppv
Aug 5, 2024

## Package

npm

@nuxt/devtools
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.3.9

## Patched versions

>= 1.3.9

## Description

### Summary

Nuxt Devtools is missing authentication on the `getTextAssetContent` RPC function which is vulnerable to path traversal. Combined with a lack of Origin checks on the WebSocket handler, an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability.

In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE.

### Details

The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for path traversals [(source)](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools/blob/c4f2b68281203fc3f61ffc97d9c6623fbfde46bb/packages/devtools/src/server-rpc/assets.ts#L88C48-L88C48), this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket.

The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request [(source)](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools/blob/c4f2b68281203fc3f61ffc97d9c6623fbfde46bb/packages/devtools/src/server-rpc/index.ts#L109) leading to [CSWSH](https://portswigger.net/web-security/websockets/cross-site-websocket-hijacking). This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly.

Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user [(source)](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools/blob/c4f2b68281203fc3f61ffc97d9c6623fbfde46bb/packages/devtools/src/dev-auth.ts#L14).

In the scenario that:

* The user has a Nuxt3 Project running
* Devtools is enabled and running
* The project is placed within the users home directory.
* The user visits a malicious webpage
* User has authenticated with devtools at least once

The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* [`writeStaticAssets` function](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools/blob/c4f2b68281203fc3f61ffc97d9c6623fbfde46bb/packages/devtools/src/server-rpc/assets.ts#L96C11-L96C28) to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed.

### PoC

POC will exploit the Devtools server on localhost:3000 (you may need to manually restart the server as the restart hook does not always work).

POC: <https://devtools-exploit.pages.dev>

1. Create a new project with nuxt.new.
2. Place the project inside your home directory.
3. Run `pnpm run dev`.
4. Open the POC page.

The POC will:

* Identify devtools version.
* Leak your devtools token.
* Create a new server handler with an insecure eval.

### Impact

* All new Nuxt projects by default (devtools is enabled) are vulnerable to arbitrary file read.
* Certain Nuxt configurations are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
