### Description

The Frontend File Manager (versions < 4.0), N-Media Post Front-end Form (versions < 1.1) plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the `nm\_filemanager\_upload\_file` and `nm\_postfront\_upload\_file` AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

Wordfence blocked **9,051 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
