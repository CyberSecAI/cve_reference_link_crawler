This is exactly what my client needed for their private Custom Admin Dashboard!
The requirement was:
1. Custom Upload and Download folder location
2. User restrictions by role (edit, delete, upload, download, create directories, etc.)
3. Front-end Access
4. Amazon AWS S3 support
5. Watermark Files
6. BuddyPress integration
7. Share files by folder and by user
8. Multi domain license
I was happy to buy the 50 Site Enterprise version!
Thank you Najeeb!
