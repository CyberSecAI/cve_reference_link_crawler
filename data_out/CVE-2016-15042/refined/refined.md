Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-15042

**Vulnerable Software:**

*   **N-Media Post Front-end Form** WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.0)
*   **Frontend File Manager** WordPress plugin (versions < 4.0)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Both plugins suffer from a lack of proper file type validation during file uploads. This allows attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server, bypassing intended restrictions.
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient server-side validation of file extensions. In the case of 'Front end file upload and manager Plugin', the plugin relies on `wp_check_filetype()` which does not return the correct file extension for non-whitelisted file extensions (like .php), making it seem like no extension is present. This bypasses the plugin's extension check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files of any type, including executable files, to the web server.
*   **Missing File Type Validation:** The plugins fail to properly validate user-supplied file types, relying on client-side checks or flawed server-side checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious code (e.g., PHP scripts), attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Privilege Escalation:** Successful code execution can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, privilege escalation, and complete compromise of the server and website.
*   **Website Defacement/Malware Injection:** Attackers can use uploaded files to deface the website or inject malware to infect visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers exploit the `nm_filemanager_upload_file` and `nm_postfront_upload_file` AJAX actions by sending crafted POST requests with a file in the request body.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable AJAX actions are accessible to unauthenticated users, allowing anyone to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**More Details from the Content:**

*   **Exploit details:**  The provided proof of concept HTML code demonstrates how to construct a POST request to upload a file through the vulnerable AJAX actions.
*   **Timeline:**  The content from pluginvulnerabilities.com details the timeline of the vulnerability disclosure process, including the dates of the developer notification, the plugin removal from the directory, and the fix releases.
*   **Wordfence stats:** Wordfence mentioned that they blocked over 9,000 attacks targeting this vulnerability in a 24 hour period, showing the severity of the vulnerability.

In summary, this CVE describes a critical arbitrary file upload vulnerability in two WordPress plugins due to insufficient file type validation. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, and website compromise.
