{
  "CVE-2024-4985": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper verification of cryptographic signatures in SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper verification of cryptographic signatures when using SAML SSO with encrypted assertions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the instance.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker would require direct network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance and a signed SAML response or metadata document.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need direct network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, and a forged SAML response with site administrator privileges. Instances utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions are not impacted."
