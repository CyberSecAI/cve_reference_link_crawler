**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause isn't specified in the advisory. It is related to how PeopleSoft Integration Broker handles incoming requests over HTTP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from an unspecified issue within the PeopleSoft Integration Broker component, potentially related to insecure handling or parsing of data. It suggests a flaw in the way the Integration Broker processes HTTP requests, which can be manipulated to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality and/or integrity within the PeopleSoft system. Specifically, a successful attack could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information (high confidentiality impact), or the ability to modify data (low integrity impact). The potential for an availability impact is listed as 'none', but other components may have an associated vulnerability that could contribute to a loss in availability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is over the network via HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the PeopleSoft Integration Broker over HTTP. They would also need the privileges necessary to exploit the vulnerability. The advisory doesn't detail specifics about these privileges, beyond that they are required and that exploitation doesn't require user interaction.
