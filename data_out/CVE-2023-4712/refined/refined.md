{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability in the `txtRoleName` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `/SysManage/AddUpdateRole.aspx` endpoint, specifically the `txtRoleName` parameter via an HTTP POST request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific authentication or network position is mentioned, implying the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication."
