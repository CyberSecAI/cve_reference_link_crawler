Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-26252:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `pspdf_prepare_page()` function within the `ps-pdf.cxx` file of the htmldoc software. This occurs due to improper handling of page numbers when preparing PDF output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory region. This can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the application due to the memory corruption, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running htmldoc, gaining unauthorized control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted HTML file to htmldoc for conversion to PDF. The specific conditions within the HTML that cause the page number handling error are not described.
- **Command Line:** The vulnerable code is accessed when running `htmldoc` with the `-f` option specifying a PDF output file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `htmldoc` command with a specially crafted HTML file. This generally implies local access to the system or the ability to provide input to the service.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need knowledge of the specific conditions to trigger the heap-buffer-overflow within the `pspdf_prepare_page()` function using the html input file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
- The issue was fixed by changes related to issue #414 and was resolved in htmldoc version 1.9.15.
- A fix was implemented by modifying `ps-pdf.cxx` to validate the page number before using it as index, which was committed with commit ID `369b2ea1fd0d0537ba707f20a2f047b6afd2fbdc`.
- The vulnerability is present in htmldoc version 1.9.12.
