In May my company started researching and testing commercial and open source applications to power a social network site. We used popular free plugins, we bought addons to extend the plugins but it all felt a little too pieced together. So we went to popular code marketplaces and bought, tested, and cried about disappointing applications. One after another.Then we found Peepso. They provided us with a free edition to try before we bought. That is just smart business. Once we tried the free edition we had to buy the premium addition. 24 hours later, we owned five licenses. When we thought we had a problem, the support team immediately resolved the issue and explained how we could avoid it in the future (user error 100%).We are 110% pleased with Peepso code and customer service.

Important Update: Changes to PeepSo Free Bundle
We want to inform you about an upcoming change to the PeepSo Free Bundle. Previously, this bundle included four plugins: Photos, Media, Chat, and Friends, along with our Gecko theme. Due to our current development schedule, we regret to inform you that the Chat and Friends plugins will no longer be part of the PeepSo Free Bundle. These plugins will stop functioning within the next 36 hours.
very sad indeed

PeepSo support does not seem to exist on WordPress. And whatever you ask them on their official channel, they say they do not provide support for free products beyond their online documentation and YouTube channel. I asked them two very simple questions I obviously could not find in their documentation, like whether their plugin has a shortcode for VIP icons and what meta-names for country and gender their plugin is using so I can overwrite them with Profile Builder plugin. They could not answer these simple questions which makes me think they are not familiar enough with their product and they only want you to buy their paid bundle. I guess their support would be the same even with the paid bundle so you should better stay away from them.
