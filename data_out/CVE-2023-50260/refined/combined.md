# Vulnerability in host\_deny AR script allows arbitrary command execution

High

[vikman90](/vikman90)
published
GHSA-mjq2-xf8g-68vw
Apr 19, 2024

## Package

wazuh-agent

## Affected versions

>= 4.2.0

## Patched versions

>= 4.7.2

wazuh-manager

>= 4.2.0

>= 4.7.2

## Description

### Summary

A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file, which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system.

### Details

This vulnerability is part of the active response feature, which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts.

By default, active responses are limited to a set of [pre defined executables](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/active-response/default-active-response-scripts.html). This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response.

However, the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file (<https://linux.die.net/man/5/hosts.deny>) to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers.

Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive.

```
int main (int argc, char **argv) {                       // src/active-response/host-deny.c
...
    // Get srcip
    const char *srcip = get_srcip_from_json(input_json);        // (1) `host-deny` takes a `srcip` from JSON message
...
    memset(hosts_deny_rule, '\0', COMMANDSIZE_4096);
    memset(hosts_deny_path, '\0', COMMANDSIZE_4096);
    if (!strcmp("FreeBSD", uname_buffer.sysname)) {
        snprintf(hosts_deny_rule, COMMANDSIZE_4096 -1, "ALL : %s : deny", srcip);
        strcpy(hosts_deny_path, FREEBSD_HOSTS_DENY_PATH);
    } else {
        snprintf(hosts_deny_rule, COMMANDSIZE_4096 -1, "ALL:%s", srcip);
        strcpy(hosts_deny_path, DEFAULT_HOSTS_DENY_PATH);
    }
...
        if (fprintf(host_deny_fp, "%s\n", hosts_deny_rule) <= 0) {        // (2) adds the line `ALL:[srcip]` to the `/etc/hosts.deny`
                                                                                  // The `srcip` is not checked before written to `/etc/hosts.deny`
                                                                                  // "ALL:ALL : spawn /usr/bin/whoami >> /tmp/PoC" is added to the `hosts.deny` file
            memset(log_msg, '\0', OS_MAXSTR);
            snprintf(log_msg, OS_MAXSTR -1, "Unable to write rule '%s' on '%s'", hosts_deny_rule, hosts_deny_path);
            write_debug_file(argv[0], log_msg);
        }
...
```
### PoC

The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So, it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root.

### Impact

This vulnerability is related to command injection, so the impact is high.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
