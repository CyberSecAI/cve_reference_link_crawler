Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-46158:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NEU files in Siemens Simcenter Femap. Specifically, the software fails to validate the length of the user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: Due to the missing length validation, an attacker can provide oversized input, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.
- Out-of-bounds write: In some cases, the vulnerability is described as an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated data structure when parsing NEU files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially taking full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious NEU File: An attacker can craft a malicious NEU file containing oversized or specially crafted data to trigger the overflow during parsing.
- Malicious Web Page: The target user needs to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page to be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious NEU file or trick the user into visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are needed for the attack other than the ability to get the victim to open a specially crafted file.
- User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page).

**Additional Notes:**
- Siemens has released an update to address this vulnerability in Simcenter Femap V2022.1 or later.
- The vulnerability is associated with multiple ZDI identifiers (ZDI-22-311, ZDI-22-312, and ZDI-22-313) which points to a number of distinct instances of the same underlying issue within the parsing logic for NEU files.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow).
- Other vulnerabilities in the same software are also listed and have similar attack vectors related to parsing .NEU files with issues ranging from memory corruption to out-of-bounds writes, all leading to potential RCE.
