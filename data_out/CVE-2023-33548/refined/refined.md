{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web UI of the ASUS RT-AC51U wireless router fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the WPA Pre-Shared Key field, allowing injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML when a user views the page with the unsanitized password. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement of the router's web UI, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the WPA Pre-Shared Key field within the router's administrator web UI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the administrator web UI of the wireless router to modify the WPA Pre-Shared Key."
