The content is related to CVE-2024-29499.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed in the context of an authenticated user. Specifically, the `/anchor/admin/users/delete/2` endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform actions, such as deleting user accounts, within the application without the victim's consent or knowledge.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker uses a crafted HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/anchor/admin/users/delete/2`.  This form, when submitted by a logged-in user, executes the request on the server as if the user initiated it, without the user's direct intent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page they control, which contains the CSRF exploit code.
