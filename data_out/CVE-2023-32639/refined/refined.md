Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper restriction of XML external entity references (XXE) within the Applicant Programme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Injection (CWE-611):** The application fails to properly sanitize or disable the processing of external entities within XML data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** By processing a specially crafted XML file, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the system where the vulnerable software is running. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, or data files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable software in order to provide the crafted XML file.
- **User Interaction:** The user of the application is required to open or process a malicious XML file provided by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the application with a malicious crafted XML file.
- The attacker does not require special privileges to perform the attack, other than the ability to interact with the application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects "Applicant Programme Ver.7.06 and earlier".
- A patch has been released as "Applicant Programme Ver7.07" to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Toyama Taku and Sakaki Ryutaro of NEC Corporation.
- The CVSS v3 score is 2.5 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a low severity vulnerability.
- The CVSS v2 score is 1.2 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).

This information provides a clear understanding of the XXE vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
