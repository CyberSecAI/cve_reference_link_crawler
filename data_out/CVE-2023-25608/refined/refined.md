Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Incomplete filtering of special elements within the command-line interpreter of FortiAP, FortiAP-W2, FortiAP-U, and FortiAP-C devices. This inadequate filtering allows for the injection of malicious command arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-792**: Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements, the vulnerability arises from the insufficient sanitization or filtering of user-supplied input, specifically when processing commands in the CLI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the affected system.
- **Information Disclosure**: The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information that might be stored in the files read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-Line Interpreter**: The vulnerability is present in the CLI of the affected Fortinet products.
- **Crafted Command Arguments**: Attackers exploit this by injecting specially crafted arguments into CLI commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the CLI of the FortiAP device.
- **Local Access**: The CVSS vector indicates that local access is required for the attack.
