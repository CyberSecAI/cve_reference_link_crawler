Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46655:

**Root Cause:**
The CloudBees CD Plugin, versions 1.1.32 and earlier, when preparing to publish files in the 'CloudBees CD - Publish Artifact' post-build step, follows symbolic links to locations outside of the intended temporary directory on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The plugin copies files from an agent workspace to a temporary directory on the controller. Because the plugin follows symbolic links, an attacker can craft symlinks within the agent workspace pointing to arbitrary locations on the Jenkins controller. The plugin then includes these files in the list to be published.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with the ability to configure Jenkins jobs can force the Jenkins controller to publish arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system to a previously configured CloudBees CD server, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with "Item/Configure" permission can create malicious symlinks within an agent workspace which will be processed during a build.
- The CloudBees CD Plugin's "Publish Artifact" post-build step will copy these symlinked files from the agent workspace to the temporary directory on the Jenkins controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have "Item/Configure" permission on a Jenkins job.
- The attacker must have a configured CloudBees CD server which the Jenkins server will publish the files to.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the file collection process prior to the actual publish action.
- The fix in CloudBees CD Plugin version 1.1.33 ensures that only files located within the expected directory are published.
