Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SANnav application printing its encrypted key within the PostgreSQL startup logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive data (encryption key) in logs.
- Less-protected path to acquire the encryption key compared to intended methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A privileged user can gain access to the SANnav encrypted key.
- This could potentially allow attackers to decrypt sensitive information or compromise the system further.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Accessing the PostgreSQL startup logs on the system hosting the SANnav application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have privileged access to the system running the SANnav application.
- The attacker must have the ability to read the PostgreSQL startup logs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found during internal penetration testing.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
- The vulnerability affects Brocade SANnav versions before 2.3.1 and 2.3.0a.
- The fix is available in Brocade SANnav v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a and later releases.
