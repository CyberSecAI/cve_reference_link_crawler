The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `aeson` library, which is used for parsing JSON in Haskell. This vulnerability is due to the usage of a non-collision-resistant hash function, FNV, within the `hashable` library that `aeson` depends on.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The `aeson` library uses `HashMap` from the `unordered-containers` library to deal with JSON Objects.
- `unordered-containers` relies on the `hashable` library for hashing.
- The `hashable` library uses the FNV hash function, which is known to be non-collision resistant.
- This allows attackers to craft malicious JSON objects with many keys that have the same hash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Non-collision-resistant hash function:** The FNV hash function used by the `hashable` library is susceptible to collisions.
- **Linear chaining for collision resolution:** The `unordered-containers` library uses linear chaining to resolve hash collisions, which has a time complexity of O(n) for insertions when there are many collisions. This makes the insertion of many colliding keys slow.
- **Fixed salt:** The hash function uses a fixed default salt, making it easy to generate collisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted JSON object with many colliding keys, an attacker can force a Haskell application using `aeson` to spend excessive time inserting elements into a `HashMap`, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious JSON Input:** An attacker sends a JSON object with many keys that produce hash collisions. This could be done through any application that parses JSON, such as a web server accepting JSON payloads.
- The attack is not limited to web servers, it applies to any application that builds up `Data.HashMap.Strict.HashMap`, `Data.HashMap.Lazy.HashMap`, `Data.HashSet.HashSet`, or `Data.Aeson.Value` from arbitrary user-provided content

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary JSON data to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to generate strings that produce hash collisions using the FNV algorithm with the specific salt used by hashable.

**Additional Information:**

- The blog post provides a detailed explanation of how to generate the colliding strings by modifying the `fnv-collider` tool.
- The author also provides example code for a vulnerable server and a program to construct a malicious JSON object
- The blog post mentions potential solutions, such as using a collision-resistant hash, random salt on startup, collisionless containers, or `Map` instead of `HashMap`.
