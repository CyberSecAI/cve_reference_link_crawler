- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling requests to the `branchList` component of PGYER codefever.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-78). The application is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via a crafted request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted request to the `branchList` component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction. They only require network access to the vulnerable component.
