Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Jan application's API endpoint `/v1/app/readFileSync` directly uses user-supplied input as a file path without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, which is then read by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read any file on the server's filesystem that the application process has permissions to access.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user input before using it to construct a file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive information, such as configuration files, user data, credentials, or any other data stored on the server.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposed information could be used to further compromise the server or related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to the `/v1/app/readFileSync` endpoint.
- **Manipulated File Path:** The attacker manipulates the request body to include an arbitrary file path, such as `/../../../../../../etc/passwd`, bypassing intended directory access restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Jan application's API interface.
- **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable API endpoint (`/v1/app/readFileSync`) and its request format.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not indicate that authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**

- The content also mentions the `/v1/app/existsSync` endpoint, which can be used to verify if a file exists on the server. This could help an attacker to confirm paths before attempting to read them.
- The provided PoC shows a sample HTTP POST request with the necessary parameters to exploit the arbitrary file read vulnerability.
- The affected version is noted as `0.4.12 Latest`.
