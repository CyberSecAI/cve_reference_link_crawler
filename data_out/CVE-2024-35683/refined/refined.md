- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions due to the lack of proper access control checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The specific impact varies depending on the function affected, but it generally allows unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploitable by any unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No special position or capabilities are needed, as the vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user.
