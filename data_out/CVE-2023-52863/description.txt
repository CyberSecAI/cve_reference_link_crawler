In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (axi-fan-control) Fix possible NULL pointer dereference

axi_fan_control_irq_handler(), dependent on the private
axi_fan_control_data structure, might be called before the hwmon
device is registered. That will cause an "Unable to handle kernel
NULL pointer dereference" error.
