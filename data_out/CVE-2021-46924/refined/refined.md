Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-46924**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   The `st21nfca` driver for the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA NFC chip allocates memory for `phy->pending_skb` during device probe, but fails to free it when errors occur during probe or when the device is removed. This results in a memory leak.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Memory Leak:** The driver lacks proper cleanup of the allocated `phy->pending_skb` memory in error handling paths within the `st21nfca_hci_i2c_probe` function and in the `st21nfca_hci_i2c_remove` function.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   A memory leak can lead to system instability and potentially denial of service if the memory is exhausted. The provided backtrace shows a memory allocation that was not freed, indicating that this is a real issue.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by normal device probing and removal. No specific external trigger is required. The memory leak will occur when the driver is initialized and fails during the probe, or when the device is removed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to cause the `st21nfca` driver to be loaded and unloaded repeatedly. This could potentially be done with root access, or by a user with the privileges to load and unload kernel modules.

**Summary of the Fix:**

The provided patches address the memory leak by adding the following:

1.  **Error Handling:**  In the `st21nfca_hci_i2c_probe` function, if an error occurs at any point before the successful call to `st21nfca_hci_probe`, the code now jumps to an `out_free` label where `kfree_skb(phy->pending_skb)` is called before returning the error.
2.  **Removal Handling**: In `st21nfca_hci_i2c_remove`, the code now checks if `phy->pending_skb` is allocated before calling `kfree_skb()` to free it.

This ensures that the allocated memory for `pending_skb` is always freed when the probe fails or when the device is removed, preventing the memory leak.
