Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-1058:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software's guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin.
- It stems from the lack of validation of input data size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is that the software does not properly validate the size of input data before processing it. This lack of validation is a common software weakness that can lead to various exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Tampering:** A malicious actor could provide crafted input data that, due to the lack of size validation, could overwrite memory locations and alter data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing large or malformed inputs, an attacker could cause the software to crash or become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have local user privileges on a system running the vulnerable vGPU software.
- **Ability to Interact with vGPU driver:** The attacker would need to be able to send data to the vulnerable driver or plugin to exploit the insufficient input validation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in both Windows and Linux guest drivers for vGPU.
- The vulnerability is rated with a base score of 7.8 which is considered high.
- The impacted software includes:
    - NVIDIA vGPU software (guest driver)
    - NVIDIA vGPU software (Virtual GPU Manager)
