Package        : wireshark
Version        : 2.6.20-0+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-4181 CVE-2021-4184 CVE-2021-4185 CVE-2021-22191
                 CVE-2022-0581 CVE-2022-0582 CVE-2022-0583 CVE-2022-0585
                 CVE-2022-0586

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, a network
traffic analyzer. An attacker could cause a denial of service (infinite loop or
application crash) via packet injection or a crafted capture file. Improper URL
handling in Wireshark could also allow remote code execution. A double-click
will no longer automatically open the URL in pcap(ng) files and instead copy it
to the clipboard where it can be inspected and pasted to the browser's address
bar.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.6.20-0+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.

For the detailed security status of wireshark please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wireshark>
