The provided content relates to a security fix for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in SOGo, specifically addressing WSTG-INPV-02. The vulnerability was fixed in commit `1e0f5f00890f751e84d67be4f139dd7f00faa5f3`.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input within strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application did not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled data before displaying it in the UI, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. This is explicitly mentioned as a fix for "WSTG-INPV-02", which refers to the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide for Input Validation.
- The code specifically targets and attempts to neutralize the following attack vectors:
    - HTML tag injection using `<` and `>`
    - `javascript:` protocol injection
    - `onmouseover` event handler injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code could be executed within the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive data
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through user-provided input fields that are not properly sanitized before being rendered in the application's UI, specifically within "folders and mail title / content".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into input fields or other data that is subsequently rendered in the application's UI. This may involve:
  - Manipulating input forms or parameters.
  - Exploiting stored XSS vulnerabilities, where malicious content is stored in the database and rendered to other users.
  - Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to inject malicious code.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `stringWithoutHTMLInjection` method in `NSString+Utilities.m`. The changes include:
- Using `NSRegularExpression` to remove potentially harmful patterns like `javascript:` and `onmouseover`.
- Adding a check for email addresses enclosed in `<>`, to not mistakenly remove them as HTML tags, improving the fix.
- Implementing HTML tag stripping logic using `NSScanner`.

The commit message `fix(security): Security fix for WSTG-INPV-02. Add XSS protection on folders and mail title / content` further confirms that the fix addresses XSS vulnerability by adding sanitization.
