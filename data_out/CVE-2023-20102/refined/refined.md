- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-provided data that is parsed into system memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data, leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the *administrator* user.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, remote attacker with access to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Secure Network Analytics product.
