- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of a dangerous function named `updateManagerPassword` within the Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an authentication bypass due to the exposure of the `updateManagerPassword` function. This function can be accessed without requiring authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication, potentially gaining full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or specific user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They simply need network access to the vulnerable application.
