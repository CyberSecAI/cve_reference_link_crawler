Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-5521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of JavaScript code embedded within SVG image files uploaded to the OpenCMS platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious code is saved on the server and executed when a user accesses the affected resource (in this case, the uploaded SVG image).
- **Unfiltered SVG uploads:** The system allows users with "gallery editor" or "VFS resource manager" roles to upload SVG files without adequate sanitization or filtering of potentially malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an SVG image. When another user accesses or views this image, the injected JavaScript code will be executed within their browser session.
- This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirection to malicious sites, or other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.
- The impact is rated as medium severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the upload of a specially crafted SVG image containing malicious JavaScript.
- Users with "gallery editor" or "VFS resource manager" privileges can upload such malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the roles of "gallery editor" or "VFS resource manager" within the OpenCMS platform, granting them permission to upload files, specifically SVG images.
- No other specific attacker positioning is mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The vendor will not fix the vulnerability related to SVG images because they stated that filtering JavaScript code of .svg files could bring unwanted effects.
- This vulnerability affects OpenCMS version 16.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.4, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- The CWE is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
- It has been fixed in version 17, but only the cross site scripting vulnerability via the title field.
