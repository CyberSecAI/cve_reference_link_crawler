{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "PF queue pile fragmentation due to flow director VSI queue being placed right after main VSI.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "When XDP is configured on a system with a large number of CPUs and an X722 NIC, the main VSI is unable to resize its queue allocation for XDP, resulting in no queues allocated when XDP is turned on.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the kernel, leading to a crash. The system becomes unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when XDP is configured on a system with a large number of CPUs and an X722 NIC, specifically when a flow director VSI queue is placed right after the main VSI, leading to queue pile fragmentation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to configure XDP and have control over the network configuration."
