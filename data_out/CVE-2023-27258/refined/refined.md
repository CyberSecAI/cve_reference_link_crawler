- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication in the `GetStudentGroupStudents` method of IDAttend's IDWeb application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of authentication allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can extract sensitive student and teacher data.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the unauthenticated access to the `GetStudentGroupStudents` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication required, implying network access to the affected application is sufficient.
