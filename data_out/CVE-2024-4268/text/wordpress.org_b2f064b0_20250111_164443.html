Install this, ditch the Elementor and page builder cr@p, and make your website simpler, faster, and reliable.
Edit: after years of use, it gave me many troubles with various updates.
The latest one was the numbered box that turned out to ruin all the formatting, and who knows how long it had been that way in the Start Here page and I didn’t notice.
Had to rework the whole page :S
