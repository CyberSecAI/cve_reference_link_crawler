  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin's blocks were vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher could inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts would execute whenever a user accessed the compromised page, leading to potential information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability could be exploited by injecting malicious code through various blocks provided by the plugin."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. The attacker would then need to insert malicious code into a page using a vulnerable block."
