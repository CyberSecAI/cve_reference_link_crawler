- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy in Cisco Finesse.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The nginx configurations used for the VPN-less reverse proxy in Cisco Finesse do not properly filter IP addresses, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition. This affects both new and existing users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable reverse proxy, which is accessible through a load balancer. No authentication is needed.
