I searched for this for a long time. It has always appeared before me, but I never tried it because of the many negative (and unanswered) reviews. This time I decided to give it a try. It works very well and does a good job. I will never look at the comments anymore üôÇ

It‚Äôs the only plugin that did what I wanted to do. But on the front end it works fine but then I‚Äôm unable to access my backend, so I have to either disable it or restore my site. And no one has got back to me on the support forum: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/invalid-header-26/

The plugin has a bug, which makes disabled language localization!
For example in the file ‚Äúdatatypes.php‚Äù line 3, contains the code :
‚Äúreturn \_\_(‚ÄúPost Field Core‚Äù) ‚Äù . As such, the translation into other languages is not working‚Ä¶
For proper operation you must change the line to:
‚Äúreturn \_\_(‚ÄúPost Field Core‚Äù,‚Äùwp\_custom\_fields\_search‚Äù) ‚Äù , and so with all the phrases!
