Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP Custom Fields Search plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly handle user-supplied attributes within the `wpcfs-preset` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected by an attacker are saved within the WordPress database and executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user views a page containing the injected script, the script will execute in their browser.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `wpcfs-preset` shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the shortcode's attributes.
*   The injected code is stored in the database and executed when the shortcode is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access. This level of access is required to create or edit posts/pages where the shortcode can be inserted.
*  The attacker needs the ability to insert shortcodes into pages/posts.

**Additional Notes**
* The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin directory due to this security issue.
* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.35.
* There is no patch available. It is advised to uninstall the plugin.
