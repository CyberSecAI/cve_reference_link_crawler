```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses `flask.send_file` or `os.path.join` with untrusted input, which allows an attacker to perform path traversal attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Traversal (CWE-22)",
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
     "Use of unsafe function `os.path.join`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, potentially including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information such as passwords, login credentials, and other secrets.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `filename` or `path` parameters, which are attacker-controlled, with sequences like `../` or absolute file paths.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified `filename` or `path` parameters to the vulnerable endpoints. This does not require any special position."
