- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ELEX WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts Plugin <= 2.1.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Displaying unwanted advertisements or content.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker does not need any privilege to perform the attack (Unauthenticated).
