{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assertion in the code generation for `range(start, start + N)` loops when `start` is a signed integer. The assertion uses a less-than-or-equal-to (`le`) comparison, which interprets signed integers as unsigned. When `start` is negative, its 255th bit is set, causing it to be interpreted as a very large unsigned number and thus making the assertion always fail, leading to a revert.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect assertion during code generation for `range()` loops with signed integer start values. Specifically, using `le` instead of `sle` for the comparison when start is signed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The execution of a contract will always revert if a `range(start, start + N)` loop is encountered with a negative `start` value, disrupting the expected functionality of the contract.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through calling a smart contract that contains a `range(start, start + N)` loop where `start` is a signed integer, and where the attacker can control the input value such that it is negative.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to call a smart contract containing a vulnerable `range()` loop, and must be able to provide a negative value for the `start` variable in the range."
