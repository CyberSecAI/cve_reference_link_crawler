# range(start, start + N) reverts for negative numbers

Low

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=0.3.8, <=0.3.10

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Summary

When looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert.

### Details

This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range (`stmt.parse_For_range()`):

[vyper/vyper/codegen/stmt.py](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/codegen/stmt.py#L286-L287)

Lines 286 to 287
in
[9136169](/vyperlang/vyper/commit/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba)

|  | \_, hi = start.typ.int\_bounds |
| --- | --- |
|  | start = clamp("le", start, hi + 1 - rounds) |

This assertion was introduced in [3de1415](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868) to fix [GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj "GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj"). The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail.

### PoC

```
@external
def foo():
    x:int256 = min_value(int256)
    # revert when it should not since we have the following assertion that fails:
    # [assert, [le, min_value(int256), max_value(int256) + 1 - 10]],
    for i in range(x, x + 10):
        pass
```
### Patches

patched in v0.4.0, specifically, [#3679](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3679) disallows this form of `range()`.

### Impact

Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32481

No CWEs
