```
for loops of the form `for i in range(x, x+N)`, the range of the
iterator is not checked, leading to potential overflow. the following
example demonstrates the potential for overflow:

```
[@external](https://github.com/external)
def test() -> uint16:
    x:uint8 = 255
    a:uint8 = 0
    for i in range(x, x+2):
        a = i
    return convert(a,uint16)  # returns 256
```

this commit fixes the issue by adding a range check before entering the
loop body.
```
