- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication. A remote attacker can efficiently guess an administrative account's authentication token by observing certain system properties.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can bypass administrative authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, leading to full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack over network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to observe certain system properties remotely. They don't need prior authentication.
