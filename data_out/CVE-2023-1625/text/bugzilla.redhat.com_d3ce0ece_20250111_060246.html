| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2181621#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-03-24 19:33:35 UTC  ``` An information leak was discovered in openstack heat. [https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/heat/+/868166](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/heat/%2B/868166) <https://github.com/openstack/heat/commit/a49526c278e52823080c7f3fcb72785b93fd4dcb>  The get stack environment API doesn't mask hidden parameter values. A malicious system user can get sensitive data by this API even though encrypt_parameters_and_properties option is set to true. All VMs deployed by this heat template may be compromised.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2181621#c1)  Nick Tait    2023-03-24 19:33:49 UTC  ``` Created openstack-heat tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 2181623](show_bug.cgi?id=2181623 "NEW - CVE-2023-1625 openstack-heat: information leak in API [openstack-rdo]")]   ``` |  |
