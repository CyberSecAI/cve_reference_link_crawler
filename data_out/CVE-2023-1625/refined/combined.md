### Bug Description

[Impact]

This is a potential security vulnerability. The upstream story has been marked as 'Vulnerability or Security-related' and is awaiting security triage: <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2010484>

[Test Case]

After a stack is created using:

openstack stack create --parameter password=test123 -t simple\_instance.yaml -e params.yaml my\_simple\_stack

where 'simple\_instance.yaml' defines a simple VM with a 'hidden'

parameter as below:

password:

    type: string

    hidden: true

    description: The password

'hidden' is honored when you run:

openstack stack show my\_simple\_stack | grep password

| | password: '\*\*\*\*\*\*'

but that's not the case for the below command as the API returns the

'hidden' parameter in plain text:

openstack stack environment show my\_simple\_stack3 | grep password

  password: test123

This behavior is observed in Focal/Ussuri and Jammy/Yoga and happens

regardless of the user role used. Namely two users with either reader

or member (admin role as well but this may be by design) face the same

issue. For example, if user1 created the stack, both user1 and user2

(a user with either reader or admin role assigned) face the same issue

described above.

Also it doesn't matter if heat.conf contains

'encrypt\_parameters\_and\_properties = true', the issue is observed

regardles of the value for this parameter.

Reproducer:

-----------

1. Create a simple stack where a 'hidden' parameter is used

2. Run 'openstack stack show <stack-id>', the hidden parameter will

appear masked.

3. Run 'openstack stack environment show <stack-id>' the hidden

parameter will appear in plain text.

4. Add 'encrypt\_parameters\_and\_properties = true' to heat.conf and

restart the heat services

5. Repeat steps 1-3, issue should be reproduced

6. Set option in step 4 as 'false' and repeat steps 1-3, issue should

be reproduced

[Regression Potential]

This changes the behavior of the API. If software depends on a hidden parameter being returned, the code will need to update the parameter to not be hidden.

I have tested the following versions: 1:18.0.0-0ubuntu1.1 for jammy, 1:19.0.0-0ubuntu1.1 for kinetic. The 'stack environment show' command honors the 'hidden' parameter as expected.
