Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-1625:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `get_environment` API in OpenStack Heat not properly masking or hiding parameter values that were intended to be hidden. Specifically, when a stack is created with a "hidden" parameter, the `openstack stack show` command masks it as `******`, but the `openstack stack environment show` command reveals it in plain text. This occurs regardless of the `encrypt_parameters_and_properties` setting in the `heat.conf` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the information leak of sensitive data through the `stack environment show` API. Parameters marked as "hidden" were not being masked, exposing their values.
*   **Bypass of Intended Security Controls:** The "hidden" parameter flag and the `encrypt_parameters_and_properties` configuration were not being honored by the `get_environment` API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An authenticated user, even with limited privileges (reader or member roles), could potentially obtain sensitive information such as passwords or other secrets, which should have remained hidden.
*   **Compromise of Deployed VMs:** The exposed information could be used to compromise VMs deployed by heat templates.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the OpenStack Heat API, specifically the `get_environment` function called by the `openstack stack environment show` command.
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenStack environment to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **OpenStack Account:** The attacker must have a valid OpenStack account with sufficient privileges to execute the `openstack stack environment show` command. This includes users with reader or member roles.
*   **Knowledge of Stack ID:** The attacker needs to know the stack ID of the deployment that contains hidden parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was present in multiple OpenStack releases, including those used in Ubuntu Focal/Ussuri, Jammy/Yoga, Kinetic, and Lunar.
*   The fix involves modifying the `get_environment` function to mask hidden parameters before returning the environment. This was addressed in the commit  `a49526c278e52823080c7f3fcb72785b93fd4dcb`.
*   The fix was backported to older releases in Ubuntu via SRU (Stable Release Updates).
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but it is still a significant security concern.
