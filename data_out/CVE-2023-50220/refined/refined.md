Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `Base64Element` class in Inductive Automation Ignition. This lack of validation leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is that the application deserializes data without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `Base64Element` class does not adequately validate user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **System-Level Privileges:** The attacker can execute code within the context of the `SYSTEM` user, gaining complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **User-Supplied Data:** The attack relies on injecting malicious data that will be processed by the vulnerable `Base64Element` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the targeted Inductive Automation Ignition server.

**Summary**
CVE-2023-50220 is a critical vulnerability in Inductive Automation Ignition that allows authenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the deserialization of untrusted data in the `Base64Element` class due to improper input validation.
