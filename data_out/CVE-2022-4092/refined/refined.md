Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   GitLab's rendering service for plain text files was not escaping HTML tags. Specifically, the `plain_unsafe` method in `app/services/markup/rendering_service.rb` simply wrapped the file content in `<pre class="plain-readme">` tags without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The lack of HTML escaping allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into a README file.
*   **Form Tag Allowed:** The subsequent sanitization process using Dumpurify and `v-safe-html` did not remove `<form>` tags, which made it possible to create a fake login form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** By injecting a fake login form into the README file, an attacker could trick users into submitting their usernames and passwords to a malicious external site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **README File Modification:** An attacker could create or modify a `README` file in a GitLab project with malicious HTML content.  It is important to note that the file name must be `README` and cannot have an extension like `README.md`
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on the user visiting the project page where the malicious `README` is rendered. The injected form is designed to mimic the legitimate GitLab login page and appears after a 3 second delay.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Project Access:** The attacker needs write access to a GitLab project to create or modify a README file within it.
*   **External Server:** The attacker must set up a server to receive the stolen credentials entered into the form.  In this case the example provided used `https://yvvdwf.me/gl`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The injected code uses CSS keyframes to animate the fake login form, making it more deceptive.
*   The attacker's injected login form is visually similar to the legitimate GitLab login page.
*   The exploit uses a redirect target set by the form action, which sends the captured credentials to an external location.
*   The report highlights that the exploit is easily done, and the default loading of the `README` file in a project main view makes it easy to trick users.
*   A video of the exploit is also provided.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to be present on GitLab.com.
