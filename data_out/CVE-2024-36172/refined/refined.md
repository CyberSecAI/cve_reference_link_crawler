The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-36172.

**CVE-2024-36172:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to improper handling of user-supplied input when rendering content.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session. This can result in the attacker gaining control over the user's account, stealing sensitive information, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious script into a field that is later rendered without proper sanitization/encoding in the application. This can be done by submitting crafted data through a form or other input mechanisms in the AEM application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to submit malicious input into the vulnerable AEM application, which requires a low-privileged authenticated user. The user interaction needed is that a victim opens the crafted content in the application for the XSS payload to trigger.
