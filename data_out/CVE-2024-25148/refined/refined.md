- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `doAsUserId` URL parameter, used for user impersonation, can be inadvertently included when creating links using the WYSIWYG editor in Liferay Portal and DXP. This occurs while the user is impersonating another user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the leakage of the `doAsUserId` parameter within created links. This leakage can lead to unauthorized user impersonation if the linked content is accessed by another user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who has access to a link containing the leaked `doAsUserId` parameter can impersonate the user specified in the URL parameter. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions as the impersonated user within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a logged-in user creating content using the WYSIWYG editor while impersonating another user. The leaked `doAsUserId` URL parameter within the generated links can be exploited when another user accesses the content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to:
    -  Be a logged-in user with permissions to create content using the WYSIWYG editor.
    - Be able to impersonate another user.
    -  Have another user access the created link containing the leaked `doAsUserId` parameter.
