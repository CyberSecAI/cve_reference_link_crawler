- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiManager VM appliance lacks an integrity check of the root file system at boot time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of file system integrity verification on boot. This allows for modification of the VM image before it's started without detection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with read/write access to the VM image before it boots can inject malicious implants into the image, leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through direct access to the VM image (e.g., on a hypervisor or storage) before the VM is started up.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires read/write access to the VM image file before the VM is booted up.
