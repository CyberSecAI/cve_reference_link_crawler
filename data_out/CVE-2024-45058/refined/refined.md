Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to verify if a user has sufficient privileges to modify their own user type. Any user with the permission to view user type configurations can exploit this flaw to elevate their privileges to an administrator by manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter during a user update.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Broken Access Control (CWE-269):** The primary weakness is the insufficient authorization check, allowing users to perform actions they shouldn't be permitted to do.
-   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** Although not explicitly stated, the lack of proper input validation for the `nivel_usuario_` parameter allows the attacker to inject an arbitrary user type.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to administrator.
-   **Account Takeover:** With admin rights, an attacker can take over accounts, modify administrative tasks, and perform other malicious actions.
-   **Data Modification and Loss:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete sensitive data.
-   **System Compromise:** The entire system is vulnerable to compromise due to unauthorized access and control.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
-   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low-level user access with permission to view user type configurations.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in version 2.9 of the i-Educar software.
-   The vulnerable code is located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, specifically around line 446.
-   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how a low-privilege user can change their user type to "Administrator" by sending a POST request with the `nivel_usuario_` parameter set to the administrator's ID (1 in this case).
-   The fix was implemented in commit `c25910c`, which adds a `canChange` function that validates if the current user has the required permissions to change the user type.
-   The `canChange` method allows modification if:
    1.  The user making the change is an admin.
    2.  The user being changed doesn't exist.
    3.  The user being changed is not an admin.
-   The fix implements an access control check, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.
-   CVSS v3 score is 8.1 (High).

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.
