Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10112

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Simple News` plugin for WordPress, specifically due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `news` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize input, allowing attackers to inject malicious web scripts into pages through the `news` shortcode's attributes. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.
- These injected scripts execute in the browser of any user accessing the page containing the shortcode, enabling malicious actions such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Defacing the website or displaying misleading content.
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of logged-in users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `news` shortcode in the Simple News plugin.
- Attackers inject malicious scripts through the shortcode's attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have at least "contributor-level" access to the WordPress site. This is because contributors are allowed to create or edit posts, which can contain shortcodes.
- **Ability to add/edit posts or pages:** The attacker needs the capability to add/edit content (where shortcodes can be added) on the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected versions of the plugin are up to and including version 2.8.
- There is no known patch available.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin directory, due to this security issue.
