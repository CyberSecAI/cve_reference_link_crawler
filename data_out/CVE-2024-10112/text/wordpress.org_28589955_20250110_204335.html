This plugin is perfect for people who are looking for a simple, clear news structure to style themselves. Decide how many columns or which grid you want and style the divs using CSS as you want them. Everything else is mostly overloaded. Thank you Morten!
PS: Tested with WP 6.4.3

Does not adhere to the theme, determines its own broad.

I love this plugin ‚Äì it is easy to use and looks great on the website I am building; I had a quick query on laying it out, which I sent yesterday and within minutes received a response. Really recommend this if you are looking to display news items on your site.

### [News section on a blog](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/news-section-on-a-blog/)

A news section that is shown in a widget (can use also short codes to show on posts/pages). Write own news, shown the excerpt with a link to the full news. It‚Äôs separated category from the blog posts, so it doesn‚Äôt get mixed into newest articles. Exactly what I needed. Great support ‚Äì got response within 24 hours.
