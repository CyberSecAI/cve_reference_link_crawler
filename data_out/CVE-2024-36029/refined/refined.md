{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sdhci-msm driver does not set the host->runtime_suspended flag, leading to potential crashes when the LED device is accessed while the controller is runtime suspended.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The driver fails to properly manage the runtime_suspended flag, which is used to gate access to the LED device during suspend states."
    ],
    "impact": "A crash can occur when accessing the LED device while the controller is suspended, potentially disrupting system functionality.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the LED device when the controller is runtime suspended."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger the access of the LED device while the controller is in a runtime suspended state, likely an internal operation.  No specific user privileges are mentioned."
