- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `makeCurRemoteApList` function within the `Rc` program due to the use of `strcpy` to copy the `ApCliSsid` parameter without any bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack buffer overflow due to the usage of strcpy with a user controlled value without validation
    - The vulnerable parameter is obtained from the system via nvram_get and is directly used by strcpy
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/apply.cgi` with an overly long `ApCliSsid` parameter.
    - Specifically, the vulnerability is reachable through the `apclient_scan.asp` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, and have knowledge of the authentication scheme.
    - Attacker needs to know the target's IP address or have the device exposed to a routable network.
