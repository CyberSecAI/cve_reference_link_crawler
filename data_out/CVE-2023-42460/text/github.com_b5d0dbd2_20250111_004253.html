### @charles-cooper **[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)** commented [Sep 26, 2023](#issue-1913971563) • edited Loading

### What I did

tracking for [GHSA-cx2q-hfxr-rj97](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-cx2q-hfxr-rj97 "GHSA-cx2q-hfxr-rj97")

### How I did it

### How to verify it

### Commit message

```
    `_abi_decode()` does not validate input when it is nested in certain
    expressions. the following example gets correctly validated (bounds
    checked):

    ```vyper
        x: uint8 = _abi_decode(slice(msg.data, 4, 32), uint8)
    ```

    however, the following example is not bounds checked:

    ```vyper
    @external
    def abi_decode(x: uint256) -> uint256:
        a: uint256 = convert(
            _abi_decode(
                slice(msg.data, 4, 32),
                (uint8)
            ),
            uint256
        )
        return a  # abi_decode(256) returns: 256
    ```

    the issue is caused because the `ABIDecode()` builtin tags its output
    with `encoding=Encoding.ABI`, but this does not result in validation
    until that itself is passed to `make_setter` (which is called for
    instance when generating an assignment or return statement).

    the issue can be triggered by constructing an example where the output
    of `ABIDecode()` is not internally passed to `make_setter` or other
    input validating routine.

    this commit fixes the issue by calling `make_setter` in `ABIDecode()`
    before returning the output buffer, which causes validation to be
    performed. note that this causes a performance regression in the common
    (and majority of) cases where `make_setter` is immediately called on the
    result of `ABIDecode()` because a redundant memory copy ends up being
    generated (like in the aforementioned examples: in a plain assignment or
    return statement). however, fixing this performance regression is left
    to future work in the optimizer.

```
