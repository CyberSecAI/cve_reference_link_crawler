# CVE-2022-34009

[CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Web Application Pen Testing](https://gainsec.com/category/web-application-pen-testing/)

I (Jon Gaines) was testing an open source web application called Fossil SCM to help teach a friend of mine (Tyler Fryxell) one night a few months ago and discovered a Denial of Service (DoS).

I disclosed it to the developers and submitted a CVE assignment request!

It was approved!

Here is some information I will share about the vulnerability.

I discovered it on a Fossil instance running on a Windows machines with Windows Defender running as the anti-virus. It was a fresh install but completely up to date.

The problem is was when you submit a ticket with malicious strings (I used this whole text found [HERE](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/J-GainSec/4a2e968c6587758e9dbdeac152c4ae1d/raw/7b62a4e54e94bffe04bf6952190fb509a4edeb37/fossil-dos.txt)). Although you might be able to just use an EICAR string (found [HERE](https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt)) I’ll have to test that in the future.

Note that an anonymous user can create and submit this ticket. What happens is the application writes the ticket to a temporary file located at

```
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\fossil_server_*
```

This results in Windows Defender flagging the file and (the application attempting to write the ticket again to a temporary file over and over again) crashing the application, making it inaccessible.

I tested it against version 2.18.

More information can be found [HERE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-34009)

Stay tuned as I have a bunch more new CVEs incoming!
