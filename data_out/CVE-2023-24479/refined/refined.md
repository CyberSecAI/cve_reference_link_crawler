- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `parse_nvram_file` function within the `httpd` service of the Yifan YF325 router does not require authentication to reach the `nvram_restore` function. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious nvram configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass, improper access control (CWE-284). The `nvram.cgi` endpoint is accessible before authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the `nvram_restore` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands by changing the admin credentials of the device and obtain root access.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted network request to the `nvram.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device. No prior authentication is required.
