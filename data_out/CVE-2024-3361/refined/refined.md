Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `category` parameter in `admin/books/deweydecimal.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can access, delete, or alter sensitive data without authorization. This includes:
    - Customer information
    - Personal data
    - Trade secrets
    - Intellectual property

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to `admin/books/deweydecimal.php`, by manipulating the `category` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and have access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker may need to be logged in to access the vulnerable page.
- The provided exploit uses sqlmap tool to demonstrate the exploit, indicating an attacker needs to be able to use such a tool, or replicate the requests.
- The attacker needs to know that the `category` parameter is vulnerable.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is:
```php
$category = $_POST['category'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM `tblcategory` WHERE `Category`='{$category}'";
```
- This code directly inserts the user-provided `$category` value into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.
- The provided sqlmap output shows various types of SQL injection being successful.
- The vulnerability can be confirmed with sqlmap by providing a request containing the vulnerable parameter `category`.
