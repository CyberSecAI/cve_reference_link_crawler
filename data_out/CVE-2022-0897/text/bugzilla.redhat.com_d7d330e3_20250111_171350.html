| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2063883#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-03-14 15:03:03 UTC  ``` The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method iterates over the driver->nwfilters, accessing virNWFilterObj instances. However, it fails to acquire the driver mutex, thus there is no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying the driver->nwfilters object. An unprivileged user could exploit this issue via libvirt API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to crash the libvirtd/virtnwfilterd daemon.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2063883#c2)  Daniel Berrangé    2022-03-17 14:30:38 UTC  ``` The upstream patch is now public, merged as <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/a4947e8f63c3e6b7b067b444f3d6cf674c0d7f36>  commit a4947e8f63c3e6b7b067b444f3d6cf674c0d7f36 Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange> Date:   Tue Mar 8 17:28:38 2022 +0000      nwfilter: fix crash when counting number of network filters          The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method iterates over the     driver->nwfilters, accessing virNWFilterObj instances. As such     it needs to be protected against concurrent modification of     the driver->nwfilters object.          This API allows unprivileged users to connect, so users with     read-only access to libvirt can cause a denial of service     crash if they are able to race with a call of virNWFilterUndefine.     Since network filters are usually statically defined, this is     considered a low severity problem.          This is assigned [CVE-2022-0897](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0897).          Reviewed-by: Eric Blake <eblake>     Signed-off-by: Daniel P.
