The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47624.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a reference count leak in the `rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change` function within the Linux kernel's SunRPC subsystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reference counting error: When the third argument 'buf' passed to the function does not match the strings "offline", "online", or "remove", the function returns -EINVAL without decrementing the reference counts of an `rpc_xprt` object and an `rpc_xprt_switch` object. These objects were previously obtained using  `rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt()` and `rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch()`, respectively.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Reference count leak: The failure to decrement the reference count of the objects leads to a memory leak. This could cause resource exhaustion over time if triggered repeatedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by writing a string other than "offline", "online", or "remove" to the `state` attribute of a sysfs entry for a given RPC transport.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the capability to write to the sysfs attributes related to RPC transports. This usually requires some form of privileged access or the ability to control or influence the sysfs operations.
