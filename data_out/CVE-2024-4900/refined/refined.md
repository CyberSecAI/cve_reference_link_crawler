Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Open Redirect

**Root Cause:** The SEOPress plugin fails to validate and properly escape user-controlled input within one of its Post settings. Specifically, the "Facebook Title" field under the Social settings allows a contributor-level user to inject a malicious payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin doesn't sanitize or validate user input in the "Facebook Title" field.
*   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The injected payload is not properly encoded, allowing it to be interpreted as HTML code, including the `HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"` meta tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker can redirect any user who views a malicious post to an arbitrary external website. This can be used for phishing attacks, spreading malware, or other malicious activities.
*   **Potential for Phishing:** By redirecting to a fake login page mimicking the original site, attackers can steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Payload Injection:** A contributor-level user crafts a malicious payload containing the `HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"` meta tag.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker creates a post containing the injected payload, hoping that other users will view the post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor or higher Role:** The attacker must have at least a contributor role on the WordPress website to create a post and modify the "Facebook Title" field.

**Technical Details:**
*   The malicious payload is injected into the "Social > Facebook Title" field.
*   The specific payload used for exploitation is: `0;https://wpscan.com/" HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" a="a`.
*   When a user views the post containing this payload, the `HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"` meta tag causes the browser to redirect to `https://wpscan.com`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) and is part of OWASP top 10 A1: Injection.
* The issue was fixed in version 7.8 of the plugin.
* The CVSS score is 2.7 (Low). This low score is likely due to the fact that it requires contributor level access and is not a direct RCE.
