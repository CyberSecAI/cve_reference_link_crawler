The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28435.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the application's processing of SVG files, specifically the `xlink:href` attribute within the `<image>` tag and the `onload` event handler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists due to the application's fetching of resources specified in a user-controlled SVG file. The `xlink:href` attribute of the `<image>` tag allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL.
- The SVG `onload` event allows arbitrary JavaScript execution, which, in this case, modifies the SVG element but can potentially be used for other purposes in different contexts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make the application send unintended HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs. This can be used to scan internal networks, extract sensitive data from internal services, or potentially conduct further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the file upload functionality of the application.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the uploaded SVG file is opened or rendered by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the application's file upload functionality, which, in this case, is within the "people's tab" and "files tab" as mentioned in the PoC.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SVG file with a specific structure.
