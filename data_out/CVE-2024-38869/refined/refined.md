- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Misconfigured API scope parameters for technician roles in ManageEngine Endpoint Central.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control mechanisms allowed technicians to bypass their designated scope limitations when deploying configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Technicians with limited scope were able to deploy configurations to remote offices or systems that they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via API calls using the technician's account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a technician with an account within the affected ManageEngine Endpoint Central installation. They also need to be aware of the API call structure that would be used to exploit the vulnerability.
