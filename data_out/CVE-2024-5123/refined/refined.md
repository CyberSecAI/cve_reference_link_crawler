Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Event Registration System fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, specifically within the search bar functionality. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- Stealing Cookie-Based Authentication Credentials: This can lead to the theft of sensitive authentication cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
- Other Attacks: The attacker can potentially use the injected script to launch further attacks, such as redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User Input: The attack vector is through the search bar on the `/registrar/` page, where an attacker can input malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Application: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Event Registration System.
- Input Capability: The attacker needs to be able to input data into the search bar.
- No Authentication Required: The PoC suggests the vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Location: The search bar on `/event/registrar/` page.
- Payload Example: The provided PoC uses the payload `'"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- Software Affected: SourceCodester Event Registration System 1.0.
- Environment: Tested on Kali Linux + PHP 8.2.12, Apache 2.4.58
