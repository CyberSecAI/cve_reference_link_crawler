- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A gadget chain exists that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism for deserialization. This chain relies only on the JDK and not any third-party libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate blacklist protection mechanism for deserialization, allowing bypass via a gadget chain.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Command Execution (RCE) is possible.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered during deserialization of SOFA Hessian protocol data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted payload containing the malicious gadget chain to an application using vulnerable versions of sofa-hessian.
