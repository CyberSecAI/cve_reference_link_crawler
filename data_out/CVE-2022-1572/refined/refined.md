- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTML2WP plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in an AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user (including subscribers) to trigger the action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF checks on an AJAX action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=html_actions` and specific parameters, an attacker can trigger the file deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, even a subscriber, to exploit the vulnerability. They must also be able to send POST requests to the server.
