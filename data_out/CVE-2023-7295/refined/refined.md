Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7295

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `search_term` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `search_term` parameter, before displaying it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the page. If a user clicks a malicious link crafted by the attacker, the injected script will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `search_term` parameter in the URL.
- Attackers can create malicious links that contain JavaScript code within the `search_term` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Video Grid plugin versions up to and including 1.21.
- The patched version is 1.22, which includes fixes for input sanitization.
- The provided diff from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows that multiple parameters, including `search_term`, `order_by`, `order_pos`, `vNonce`, and `action`, are now sanitized using functions like `sanitize_text_field`, `esc_url_raw`, and `esc_html` and `intval`.
