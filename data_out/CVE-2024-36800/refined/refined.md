Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `SEMCMS_Download.php` file, specifically when handling the `ID` parameter. The application directly includes the unsanitized `ID` parameter into an SQL query without adequate filtering.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Although the application implements a filter function `input_check_sql()` that attempts to block common SQL keywords and characters, it can be bypassed. The filter function uses a regular expression to match against potentially malicious strings, but it fails to account for techniques like using `OR` conditions with boolean expressions to extract information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, other confidential data), and potentially modify or delete data. The provided example demonstrates how an attacker can use boolean-based SQL injection to determine the length of the database name and then extract the database name character by character.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `ID` GET parameter in `SEMCMS_Download.php` when the `type` parameter is set to `edit`.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require an account to exploit the vulnerability. They can directly send the malicious crafted requests to the affected endpoint. The provided python script shows an example of exploiting this vulnerability and extracting the database name, including logging into the application admin panel first to get valid cookies for authentication.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The `input_check_sql` function is intended to be a global SQL query string filtering function. It uses a regular expression to match common SQL keywords. However, it is bypassed using boolean logic.
* The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting SQL boolean conditions into the ID parameter, such as `-1 or 1` or `-1 or 0`, to observe different application behavior, thus confirming the vulnerability.
*   The provided Python script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to extract the database name. The script first logs into the admin panel and then uses the boolean based SQL injection to extract the database name.
