Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `pdf_new_array()` function within the MuPDF library. Specifically, the leak occurs within the `pdf_add_cid_font_widths` function when processing CID fonts.
- The issue arises when a run_obj is not properly released, particularly when the current code matches the number of glyphs in the font face (`curr_code == face->num_glyphs`). In such cases, the `run_obj` should be published (added to the widths array) and dropped, but this wasn't happening before the fix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Unreleased memory allocated for objects in `pdf_new_array()`, specifically `run_obj`, leads to a gradual consumption of memory when processing a malicious PDF file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly processing a maliciously crafted PDF could cause the application or system to run out of memory, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Application Instability:** Memory exhaustion can lead to application crashes and unpredictable behavior, affecting the reliability of the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file that contains a CID font that triggers the code path with the memory leak.
- The attack vector is the processing of the malicious PDF using MuPDF tools such as `mutool convert`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply a malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a PDF file to be processed by software using the vulnerable MuPDF library. This could be done by:
    - Embedding the file on a website or in an email.
    - By directly providing a PDF file to be processed locally.

**Additional Information**
- The issue is resolved in commit `05720b4ee3dbae57e65546dc2eecc3021c08eeea`.
- The fix introduces logic to publish and drop the run_obj within `pdf_add_cid_font_widths` when `curr_code == face->num_glyphs`
- The vulnerability was found using a fuzzer (`AFL++`) tool.
