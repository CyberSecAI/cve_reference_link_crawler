- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Device Theme Switcher WordPress plugin, versions 3.0.2 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force higher-privileged users (such as administrators) to perform unwanted actions on the website without their knowledge or consent by tricking them into submitting a crafted request. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable actions within the plugin, but in general could lead to unauthorized theme changes or other administrative modifications.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request (e.g., a malicious link or form) that is triggered when a victim with an active session visits a malicious website or opens a malicious email. The attacker needs to trick a user to trigger a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user to trigger it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the website.
