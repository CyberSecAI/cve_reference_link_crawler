```text
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (specifically, the password) into an SQL query without any sanitization or use of parameterized queries/prepared statements.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could manipulate the SQL query to potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or perform other malicious actions.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability is located in the login functionality at `/prison/Account/login.php`, where the password field is vulnerable.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to interact with the login form to inject malicious SQL code into the password field.
