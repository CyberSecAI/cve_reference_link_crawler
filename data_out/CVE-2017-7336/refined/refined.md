- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiWLM application has a hardcoded password for the "upgrade" user account. This account is used to transfer files to and from FortiWLC controllers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the "upgrade" account credentials could transfer files to any connected or previously connected FortiWLC controllers as an administrator. This could lead to further security issues by gaining unauthorized access and control of the controllers.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs to obtain the hardcoded credentials, likely through reverse engineering or some other means, as the credentials are not publicly available.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the hardcoded credentials for the "upgrade" user, and network access to the FortiWLM and the connected controllers.
