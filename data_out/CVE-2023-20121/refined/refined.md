- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of parameters sent to a specific CLI command within the restricted shell of Cisco EPNM, Cisco ISE, and Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-77) in the restricted shell.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can escape the restricted shell and gain *root* privileges on the underlying operating system. Note that for EPNM and Prime Infrastructure, root access is only gained when the vulnerability is exploited by an admin role.
- **Attack vectors**: By logging into a device and issuing a crafted CLI command within the restricted shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated shell user, either an administrative or a *read-only* role account.
