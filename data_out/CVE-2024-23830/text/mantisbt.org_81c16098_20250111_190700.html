| Summary | 0019381: CVE-2024-23830: Host header attack vulnerability | | | | |
| Description | Advisory: MantisBT 1.2.19 - Host header attack vulnerability Author: Pier-Luc Maltais Affected Software: MantisBT 1.2.19 Vendor URL: <https://www.mantisbt.org/> Vulnerability Description: MantisBT 1.2.19 is vulnerable to an Host header attack that can be exploited by an unauthenticated user to hijack another user account. Technical Details: This exploit use the Host header attack to poison the link in the password reset mail. You need to know the victim username and e-mail. You also need a remote host that you control to catch the verification hash needed for password reset.   1. Access the password reset feature and fill the form with the    victim username and e-mail.  <http://{VULNERABLE_MANTIS}/mantisbt/lost_pwd_page.php> 2. Using an intercepting proxy like Burp, change the Host header    with your evil host.  Original request :  POST /mantisbt/lost\_pwd\_page.php HTTP/1.1    Host : {VULNERABLE\_MANTIS}    [...]  Modified request :  POST /mantisbt/lost\_pwd\_page.php HTTP/1.1    Host : evil.com    [...] 3. When the user receive the e-mail, the link is poisoned with    the evil host.  [...]    visit the following URL to change your password:    <http://evil.com/mantisbt/verify.php?id=1&confirm_hash=81ece020dfcd6d53e02c5323583cdead>    [...] 4. Now, when the victim click on the link to reset his password,    his verification hash will be sent to our evil host. All we    have to do is access the verify.php page with his hash, so    we can change his password and hijack his account.  <http://{VULNERABLE_MANTIS}/mantisbt/verify.php?id=1&confirm_hash=81ece020dfcd6d53e02c5323583cdead>  Solution: Use $\_SERVER['SERVER\_NAME'] (server controlled) instead of $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] (client controlled) Disclosure Timeline: 16/02/2015 - Found the vulnerability 17/02/2015 - Wrote this advisory 17/02/2015 - Contacted developers on MantisBT forum 18/02/2015 - Opened an issue in the bug tracker References: [1] <http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html> [2] <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2297403/http-host-vs-server-name/2297421#2297421> | | | | |

I'm not so keen on using SERVER\_NAME only as that may not work in all situations since it is dependent on the web server's setup.  Maybe a better approach would be to get rid of the unsafe use of HTTP\_HOST in the detection mechanism or trigger a warning if it's being used, and let the admin set the (canonical) path in config\_inc.php. Another option would be to introduce a new setting to validate the path (similar to what Drupal did), but maybe that's overkill.  I need to think some more about this.

We could completely remove access of $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] in master 1.3.x, and wait for feedback of users. Another option for 1.3.x is to change order of the $t\_host assignment, set a global variable if $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] is used, check for the variable in admin/check and login\_page.php (if $g\_admin\_checks is set) and provide a warning if the variable is set.  ```  $g_http_host_used = false; if( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'] ) ) { # Support ProxyPass $t_hosts = explode( ',', $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'] ); $t_host = $t_hosts[0]; } else if( isset( $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ) ) { $t_host = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . $t_port; } else if( isset( $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] ) ) { $t_host = $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] . $t_port; } else if( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] ) ) { $t_host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']; $g_http_host_used = true; }  ```  Furthermore we would have to describe the configuration of the web server in this case and describe also the right setting for $g\_path in config\_inc.php if configuration of the web server is not possible or does not work.  Not sure if we could do the same for 1.2.x and risk breaking existing installations. Especially because we are hardly able to test all possible combinations of supported PHP versions and different web servers and versions.  Every kind of potentially breaking change would have to be described in installation/upgrade guide and would have to be part of the release announcement of 1.2.20.  BTW, I found that the code block in master starting with if( !isset( $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] )) { <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/blame/master/config_defaults_inc.php#L187> is dead code. It's in a block that starts with if( isset ( $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] ) ) { |

Am I missing something? |

| [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)   [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)  2015-02-19 03:12  developer    [~0048872](view.php?id=19381#c48872 "Direct link to note") | [@vboctor](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=3081)  The MantisBT host is not compromised.  The issue is that we rely on the client-provided HTTP\_HOST to build $g\_path, allowing an attacker to initiate a password reset process for any user for which they know the id and password, and by inserting "evil.com" instead of "mantisbt.org", the e-mail we send to the user will point them back to "evil.com" thus letting the attacker retrieve the verification key and using it to hijack the user's account.  Obviously this requires the user to actually click the link without verifying it.  [@atrol](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=11111)  Thanks for your feedback. Your suggestion goes along the lines of what I was thinking.  Good catch also with the dead code block.  @Pier-Luc  You mentioned a blog in your forum post [1], does that need to be referenced in the CVE ? If so please provide the URL.  One more question, about the use of HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST - I have not actually tested this, but would assume that this can be spoofed in the same way you described above, right ?

I added the X-Forwarded-Host header line in the request :  POST /mantisbt/lost\_pwd.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.101.90 X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com [...]  and the link was poisonned with evil.com.

We need to consider backwards compatibility before releasing anything, which makes fixing this not so trivial.  If I may make a comment, it would have been nice(r) to announce this deadline of yours up front. That being said, what are your plans moving forward - assuming we're not able to release a fix shortly ? |

I really don't want to go full disclosure. If I give you two more weeks, will you be able to release a patch? If not, I will relase the advisory on my blog, post it on exploit-db, share it on twitter, etc.  This vulnerability put your users informations at risk and it is your responsability to mitigate that risk, even if it's done in your spare time. |

For the record, it is also my responsibility to take care of my family, and do the job my employer pays me for. It's all a question of priorities...  Using open-source software implies accepting some risks, and an unpatched vulnerability is one of them.  That being said and despite appearances, I *do* take security issues very seriously, and will do my best to get this patch out within 2 weeks. Will let you know when the patch is ready so you can confirm whether it actually fixes the issue or not before I release it to the general public. |
