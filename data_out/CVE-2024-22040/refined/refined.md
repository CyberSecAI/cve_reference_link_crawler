The provided content is related to CVE-2024-22040.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The network communication library in affected systems insufficiently validates HMAC values which might result in a buffer overread.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to insufficient validation of HMAC values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash the network service, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- For Cerberus PRO EN/UL and Desigo Fire Safety UL Engineering Tools, the impact is limited to the tool itself, not the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected devices/tools.
- For Engineering tools, the attacker needs to be an "on-path" attacker, able to intercept and modify the communication in the fire system network.
- No authentication is required.
