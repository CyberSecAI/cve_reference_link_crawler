SUMMARY

Several products used in Desigo Fire Safety UL and Cerberus PRO UL Fire Protection Systems contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the network communication stack. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker, who gained access to the fire protection system network, to execute arbitrary code on the affected products (CVE-2024-22039) or create a denial of service condition (CVE-2024-22040, CVE-2024-22041).

Product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities is documented in the chapter “Vulnerability
Description”.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-22039

The network communication library in affected systems does not validate the length of certain X.509 certificate attributes which might result in a stack-based buffer overflow.
This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code on the underlying operating system with root privileges.

| CWE | CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') |

Product Specific Vulnerability Description

For the following products, the impact of the vulnerability is different.

Cerberus PRO UL Engineering Tool:

Successful exploitation requires an on-path attacker that intercepts the communication of the engineering tool in the fire system network; code execution might be possible on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the engineering tool user account.
