| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator SSL/TLS Certificate Validation Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ndo-tlsvld-FdUF3cpw  First Published: 2024 October 2 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwi72006](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi72006)     CVE-2024-20385     CWE-295       CVSS Score: [Base 5.9](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20385     CWE-295       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndo-tlsvld-FdUF3cpw/csaf/cisco-sa-ndo-tlsvld-FdUF3cpw.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept sensitive information from an affected device.  This vulnerability exists because the Cisco NDO Validate Peer Certificate site management feature validates the certificates for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud Network Controller (CNC), and Cisco Nexus Dashboard only when a new site is added or an existing one is reregistered. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using machine-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and Cisco NDO and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn sensitive information during communications between these devices.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndo-tlsvld-FdUF3cpw>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco NDO.  **Note:** Starting with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Release 3.1(1k), Cisco NDO is distributed in Cisco Nexus Dashboard unified releases.
