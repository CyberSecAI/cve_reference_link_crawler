- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) validates certificates for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud Network Controller (CNC), and Cisco Nexus Dashboard only during the addition or re-registration of a site. This lack of continuous validation makes the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate SSL/TLS certificate validation. Specifically, certificates are not validated continuously, but only when a site is added or re-registered.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to intercept and learn sensitive information exchanged between Cisco NDO and other devices (Cisco APIC, CNC, and Nexus Dashboard).
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept traffic between the Cisco NDO and the other devices (APIC, CNC, or Nexus Dashboard) and be able to use a crafted certificate to impersonate the affected device. The attacker does not need any authentication.
