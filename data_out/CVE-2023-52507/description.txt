In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: nci: assert requested protocol is valid

The protocol is used in a bit mask to determine if the protocol is
supported. Assert the provided protocol is less than the maximum
defined so it doesn't potentially perform a shift-out-of-bounds and
provide a clearer error for undefined protocols vs unsupported ones.
