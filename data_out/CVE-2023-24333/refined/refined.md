Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in a stack-based buffer overflow within the Tenda AC21 router's firmware. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the `schedEndTime` parameter without proper bounds checking, which leads to the overflow if the input is excessively long.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without checking the size of the input, allowing for an overflow if the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Lack of input validation:** The firmware does not properly validate or sanitize the `schedEndTime` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the size of the copied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to redirect execution flow to an address of their choosing.
- **Privilege escalation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain root shell access, effectively taking complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
- **`schedEndTime` parameter:** The malicious payload is included within the `schedEndTime` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, indicating that the attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have access to the web interface via other methods such as port forwarding.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL path (`/goform/openSchedWifi`) and the parameter to exploit (`schedEndTime`).
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a POST request with the malicious payload.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The provided proof of concept does not indicate the need for prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability using a long string for `schedEndTime`.
- The content also states that a stable root shell can be obtained after successfully exploiting this vulnerability.
- The specific vulnerable firmware version is US\_AC21V1.0re\_V16.03.08.15\_cn\_TDC01.

This information provides more detail than the standard CVE description which typically lacks the specifics of the vulnerable parameter, endpoint and affected function.
