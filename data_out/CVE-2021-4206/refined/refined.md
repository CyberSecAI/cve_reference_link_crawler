  "CVE-2021-4206": {
    "description": "The QEMU QXL video accelerator is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `cursor_alloc` function. By setting width and height to large values, an integer overflow can occur when calculating the size of the cursor, resulting in a small buffer allocation. Subsequently, when unpacking cursor data, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to the discrepancy between the allocated buffer size and the amount of data written, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution in the context of the QEMU process on the host.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the buffer size for cursor allocation, leading to an undersized buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious privileged guest user can crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": "A guest operating system can send specially crafted cursor commands to the QXL video device.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a high-privileged user within the guest OS and the VM needs to have a QXL Video Device and VNC server graphics."
