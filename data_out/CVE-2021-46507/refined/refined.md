Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow within the `Jsi_LogMsg` function, specifically triggered during the conversion of a value to a string via `Jsi_ValueToString`. The issue is caused by a recursive call chain involving `Jsi_LogMsg` and `Jsi_ValueToString` when processing certain crafted input, leading to excessive stack usage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.
- Improper handling of specific input data, causing infinite recursion when converting values to strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to a stack overflow, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript code provided as input. Specifically, using `WebSocket` function with specially crafted object or using `times` with `WebSocket` and an expression that evaluates to NaN or undefined.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide the vulnerable software with malicious Javascript input.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in `src/jsiUtils.c:151` within the `Jsi_LogMsg` function.
- The call stack shows recursive calls between `Jsi_LogMsg` (at `src/jsiUtils.c:229`) and `Jsi_ValueToString` (at `src/jsiValue.c:526`).
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted WebSocket call within a `times` function with the problematic expression `null % null`.
- AddressSanitizer output shows a stack overflow with specific addresses and the call stack leading to the overflow.

This information is more detailed than a simple CVE description would provide.
