Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application directly incorporates user-supplied values from the `name`, `gender`, `dob`, `email`, `mobile`, and `address` parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the improper handling of user inputs in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the data stored in the database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform other unauthorized actions on the database.
- **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `/control/adds.php` file.
- The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable page with malicious SQL code injected within the `name`, `gender`, `dob`, `email`, `mobile`, or `address` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific privileges are mentioned besides being able to access the vulnerable page.
