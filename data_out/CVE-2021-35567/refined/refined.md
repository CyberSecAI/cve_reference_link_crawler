  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Java Kerberos library handles delegation constraints.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of delegation capabilities"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker may be able to escalate privileges or impersonate other users through improper delegation handling, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to a Java application utilizing Kerberos delegation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have some level of network access and knowledge of a vulnerable application using Kerberos delegation. It is likely they would need to be able to initiate a Kerberos authentication process that would lead to the vulnerable code being executed."

  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-35567",
  "details": "The provided content includes details from various sources that indicate CVE-2021-35567 is related to a flaw in Java's Kerberos implementation, specifically around constrained delegation. The Oracle advisory mentions 'More Constrained Delegation', and the Fedora and Debian security announcements list this CVE as part of security updates to openjdk-8, openjdk-11, and openjdk-17, indicating that this vulnerability is related to the Java Kerberos library. An attacker exploiting this could lead to elevation of privileges or impersonating another user by improper delegation handling. Netapp also lists the CVE as a vulnerability affecting products that use Java SE. The Gentoo advisory lists this CVE as one of the vulnerabilities that the OpenJDK update addresses, but does not provide specific details beyond indicating a denial of service could occur."
