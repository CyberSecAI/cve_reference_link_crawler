Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2398:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in libcurl when handling HTTP/2 server push. When an application allows HTTP/2 server push and the number of received headers exceeds the maximum limit (1000), libcurl aborts the push but fails to free all previously allocated memory for the headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing resource release after effective lifetime (CWE-772)
- Memory leak

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A server sending many `PUSH_PROMISE` frames with an excessive number of headers can cause a memory leak of multiple megabytes per response.
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption.
- The error condition fails silently making it hard to detect by applications.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious HTTP/2 server pushing numerous promises with excessive headers.
- The curl command-line tool and applications using the libcurl library are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control an HTTP/2 server.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted sequence of `PUSH_PROMISE` frames with a large number of headers.

**Additional details:**
- Affected versions range from curl 7.44.0 to 8.6.0
- Fixed in version 8.7.0 by ensuring all header memory is freed on errors.
- HTTP/2 server push is a relatively rare feature.
- The vulnerability was reported by w0x42 on hackerone.
- NetApp products are also affected.
- Apple macOS products are also affected, specifically macOS Monterey 12.7.6, macOS Ventura 13.6.8 and macOS Sonoma 14.6.
