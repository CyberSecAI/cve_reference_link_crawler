**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34854

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. This lack of validation leads to an uncontrolled memory allocation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Uncontrolled memory allocation due to insufficient input validation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. This means an attacker could gain control over the virtual machine host.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker must already have the ability to execute code on the guest operating system.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low-privileged code execution on the guest OS to exploit the vulnerability.
