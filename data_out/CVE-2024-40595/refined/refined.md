Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- During the RDP connection setup in One Identity Safeguard for Privileged Sessions (SPS), a sensitive piece of information is transmitted in plain text from the client to the SPS appliance. This occurs during message exchanges between client and SPS during RDP connection setup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Transmission:** A critical piece of authentication information is sent without encryption during the RDP connection setup process.
- **Authentication Bypass:** A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker can intercept this plaintext information and use it to bypass authentication, gaining access to the victim's target resource through a monitored session in SPS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to privileged sessions on target resources.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can hijack a single session that was initiated by a legitimate user.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Although the session is recorded and monitored by SPS, the attacker could still access sensitive data, if exposed within the session, and potentially perform malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the SPS appliance.
- **RDP Protocol:** The vulnerability is specific to the RDP protocol within the SPS appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the SPS appliance.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to intercept the vulnerable information within a specific time window after the legitimate user initiates the connection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The attack requires a legitimate user to first perform gateway authentication.
- The attacker cannot choose the target server or account; it is determined by the legitimate user's connection and SPS configuration.
- The vulnerability only affects the RDP protocol and not other supported protocols.
- The integrity of the SPS appliance itself is not affected.
- The authentication bypass is only practical when a credential store is configured in the connection policy. Without it, the attacker must perform a second authentication step at the target resource.
- The stolen information is only useful once, and for a limited time window, meaning the attack cannot be performed invisibly.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-40595

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.0.5.1 LTS and 7.5.1 or later versions. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of the software.
