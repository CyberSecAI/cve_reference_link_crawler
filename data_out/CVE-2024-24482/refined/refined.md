- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application infers resource file output paths based on their resource names, which can be manipulated by an attacker on Windows due to path compatibility and insufficient filtering. Specifically, the filtering logic `entry.contains("..\\") || entry.contains("\\..")` was insufficient as `../../../poc` does not match that pattern due to the use of forward slashes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) due to insufficient input validation and filtering of resource paths. Specifically, it does not properly handle forward slashes when checking for directory traversal attempts on Windows.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can write arbitrary files to locations outside of the intended directory during the decoding process. This could allow for arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious APK file containing resource entries with manipulated paths, an attacker can control where files are written during the decoding process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft and supply a malicious APK file to the target user. The target user must then use the vulnerable version of Apktool on a Windows machine. User interaction is required for this exploitation.
