Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36762:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The TFTP packet processing function in NicheStack does not ensure that a filename is null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing null termination:** The code fails to ensure that the filename within a TFTP packet is properly null-terminated.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** When `strlen()` is subsequently called on the filename, it may read beyond the bounds of the protocol packet buffer if the filename is not null-terminated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted TFTP packet with a filename that lacks a null terminator to a vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device.
- No authentication needed: The vulnerability does not require any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected component is the TFTP module within the NicheStack TCP/IP stack.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of NicheStack prior to 4.3.
- The vendor, HCC Embedded, has released a fix for the issue in the `in_tftp` module version 1.2.
- The provided table of vulnerabilities (INFRA:HALT) indicates a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 for this vulnerability, classifying it as high severity.
