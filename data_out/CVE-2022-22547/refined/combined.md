# Onapsis Security Advisory 2022-0006: Information Disclosure vulnerability
in SAP Focused Run (Simple Diagnostics Agent 1.0)

## Impact on Business

Running unnecessary services, like a jetty webserver, may lead to increased
surface area for an attack and also it unnecessarily exposes underlying
vulnerabilities.

## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/21/2022
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2022-0006
- Researcher(s): Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SIMPLE\_DIAGNOSTICS\_AGENT 1.0

  (Check SAP Note 3147102 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: CWE-200
- CVSS v3 score: 5.3 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- Risk Level: Medium
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2022-22547
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3147102

## Affected Components Description

SAP Focused Run is a spin-off from SAP Solution Manager concentrating on the
specific needs of high volume system and application monitoring, alerting
and
analytics needs.
(<https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-focused-run/expert-portal/>)

## Vulnerability Details

The Simple Diagnostic Agent exposed a Jetty Web server on a random port,
between
9000-65535. This service does not handle any API or servlets, as well as
does
not have any incoming or outcoming network communication. This allows
information gathering which could be used to exploit future open source
security
exploits.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3147102 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3147102>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
