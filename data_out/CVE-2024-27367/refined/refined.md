Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-27367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `slsi_rx_roamed_ind()` function.
- The function lacks input validation for the length parameter received from userspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is a heap over-read. Due to the missing length validation, the function might attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to validate the length of data received from the userspace, allowing potentially malicious data to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** A successful heap over-read could expose sensitive data residing in memory beyond the intended buffer. The overread can possibly lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the userspace interface, by sending crafted data with a malicious length parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send data to the `slsi_rx_roamed_ind()` function via the userspace interface. This implies the attacker must have some level of access to the system to interact with this interface.

**Affected Products:**
- Exynos 980
- Exynos 850
- Exynos 1080
- Exynos 1280
- Exynos 1380
- Exynos 1330
- Exynos 1480
- Exynos W920
- Exynos W930

**Additional Information:**
