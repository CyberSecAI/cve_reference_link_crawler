### Description

The Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pms\_stripe\_connect\_handle\_authorization\_return function in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the Stripe payment keys.
