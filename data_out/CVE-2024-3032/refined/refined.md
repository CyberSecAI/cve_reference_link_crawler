- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Themify Builder plugin does not validate a parameter before redirecting the user to its value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirect vulnerability. The plugin redirects users to a URL specified in the `tb_redirect_fail` parameter without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site, potentially for phishing attacks or malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL containing the vulnerable parameter, an attacker can induce the plugin to redirect the user. Specifically, this can be done through the `/wp-login.php` endpoint using a POST request with the `tb_redirect_fail` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, and can trigger the vulnerability remotely. The attacker must craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter.
