{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `moved_len` variable in `ext4_move_extents()` function was only updated after all extent moves were completed. If the loop failed prematurely after successfully moving some extents, `moved_len` would remain zero, leading to incorrect discarding of preallocations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free of blocks",
      "Incorrect resource management",
      "Zero-division bug"
    ],
    "impact": "A double-free vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and potentially a system crash or even arbitrary code execution. The zero-division bug can cause a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via `EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT` ioctl by moving extents between files. Overlapping extents with preallocated extents are required to trigger the double-free. Subsequently, the trim operation triggers a zero-division bug.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to trigger the `ext4_move_extents()` function, which likely requires file system access to an ext4 volume, and the ability to execute the trim operation. The attacker would need to craft specific input to cause the loop to fail mid-move after moving some extents, and overlapping pre-allocated extents."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves updating the `moved_len` variable after each successful extent move within the loop in `ext4_move_extents()` function. This ensures that preallocations are discarded correctly even if the loop exits prematurely."
