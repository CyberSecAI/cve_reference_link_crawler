Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the Dreamer CMS template engine. Specifically, the `{dreamer-cms:include}` tag allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files, making it vulnerable to file inclusion attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The core issue is the ability to include files from the server's filesystem via the `{dreamer-cms:include file='...'}` tag, lacking any restrictions or sanitization of the file path provided.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the file paths provided to the include functionality which leads to the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server's file system, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing user accounts, system configurations, and other confidential data.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on the server configuration and accessible files, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability as a stepping stone for further exploitation like Remote Code Execution (RCE) if they gain access to files which could allow RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Template Modification:** The attacker would need to modify a template file within the CMS through the template management interface.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects the malicious include statement ` {dreamer-cms:include file='../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd'/}` into the template file.
- **Triggering the Vulnerability:** The attacker then navigates to a webpage that uses the modified template (e.g. "About us" page), triggering the vulnerable code and forcing the server to display the content of the specified file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to CMS Template Management:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to modify template files within the Dreamer CMS administrative interface. This likely means having administrator or editor-level access to the CMS.
