- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via a crafted URL or similar method that injects a malicious script, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to craft a URL or manipulate input that is then reflected back to the user. They would likely need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
