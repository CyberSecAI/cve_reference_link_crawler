- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the TCPDF library. Specifically, the regular expression used to parse SVG files is vulnerable to crafted inputs, leading to excessive backtracking and denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is a ReDoS caused by an inefficient regular expression. When parsing SVG files, the library uses a regex that is susceptible to a specially crafted input that results in a very long processing time due to excessive backtracking, eventually leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. An attacker can cause the affected application to consume excessive CPU resources, making the application unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through parsing an untrusted SVG file with malicious content via TCPDF's `ImageSVG()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted SVG file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of TCPDF.
