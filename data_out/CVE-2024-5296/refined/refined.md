- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the `TokenUtils` class of D-Link D-View.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded cryptographic key, which allows for authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker with network access to the affected D-Link D-View installation can exploit this.
