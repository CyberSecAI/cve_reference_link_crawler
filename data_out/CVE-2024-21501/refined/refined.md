Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `sanitize-html` library's processing of `style` attributes when used on the backend. Specifically, when the `style` attribute is allowed and `parseStyleAttributes` is enabled, the library attempts to parse CSS, including sourceMappingURL comments. Due to this, when a specially crafted URL is provided within the `background-image` property containing a sourceMappingURL to an existing file, the `sanitize-html` library will remove the style attribute and return only the anchor tag; otherwise if the file does not exist, it will return the style attribute with the sanitized url.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to determine the presence or absence of files on the server. This is achieved by exploiting the sourceMappingURL directive within CSS.
-   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The library fails to properly sanitize or ignore sourceMappingURL directives within CSS when parsing `style` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **File Enumeration:** An attacker can enumerate files and directories on the server, including project dependencies.
-   **Information Leakage:** This may leak sensitive information about the server's file system structure and potentially reveal information about the project's dependencies.
-   **Possible Further Attacks:** Knowledge of the file system structure could enable more targeted attacks, or information about the tech stack that the target is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The primary attack vector is through user-supplied HTML containing a `style` attribute within the background-image property that specifies a crafted `sourceMappingURL` directive.
-  This input is then processed by the vulnerable `sanitize-html` library on the backend.
- The attacker can observe whether the style tag is returned by the sanitization to infer whether the target file exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to submit or inject HTML into an application that utilizes the vulnerable `sanitize-html` library with the `style` attribute allowed and the `parseStyleAttributes` enabled.
-   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges on the system.
- The attack is remotely exploitable.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `sanitize-html` versions prior to 2.12.1
- The vulnerability is addressed in `sanitize-html` version 2.12.1
- The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium)
- The fix involves ignoring source map comments when processing with PostCSS.
