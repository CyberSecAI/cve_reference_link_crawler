 -

| In this release of `apostrophe`, we bumped our dependency on `sanitize-html` to `^2.12.1` at a minimum, to ensure that `npm update apostrophe` is sufficient to guarantee a security update is installed.  Version 2.12.1 of `sanitize-html` is a security update, which prevents specially crafted HTML documents from revealing the existence or non-existence of files on the server. The vulnerability did not expose any other information about those files.  Thanks to the [Snyk Security team](https://snyk.io/) for the disclosure and to [Dylan Armstrong](https://dylan.is/) for the fix. |
