The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda FH1206 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists in the `fromSafeUrlFilter` function due to the use of `sprintf` with a user-controlled `page` parameter without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow.
- Unsafe use of `sprintf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack overflow can allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by overwriting return addresses or other sensitive data on the stack. This could lead to full control of the device, potentially allowing the attacker to modify firmware settings or eavesdrop on traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SafeMacFilter` endpoint with a large value in the `page` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router. This generally implies the attacker is on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker doesn't require prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `fromSafeUrlFilter`
- The vulnerable firmware version is FH1206 V02.03.01.35
- The vulnerable code snippet is `sprintf(v11, "firewall_mac.asp?page=%s", v8);`
- A proof of concept exploit is provided using a python script and sends 1000 'a' characters in the page parameter.
