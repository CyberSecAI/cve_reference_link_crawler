### Description

The WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post title modification due to a missing capability check on the wcpt\_presets\_\_duplicate\_preset\_to\_table function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access and above to change titles of arbitrary posts. Missing sanitization can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting when viewed by an admin via the WooCommerce Product Table.
