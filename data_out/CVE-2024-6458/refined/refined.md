Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6458

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function within the `presets/presets.php` file of the WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin.
- Specifically, there isn't a capability check to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform this action.
- Additionally, missing sanitization of the post title leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function lacks a capability check, allowing unauthorized users to execute it.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin doesn't sanitize the post title, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability when an admin views the modified title.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Post Title Modification:** Attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the titles of arbitrary posts within WordPress.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the post title. When an administrator views the affected post title, the malicious script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with admin privileges, such as cookie theft, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WordPress admin panel.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with minimal permissions (subscriber or higher) accesses the table editor and manipulates the `wcpt_preset` and `post_id` parameters to trigger the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress admin interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function is located in `/wc-product-table-lite/trunk/presets/presets.php`
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.5.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.6.
- The fix included adding a capability check to the `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function, ensuring that only users with the "create_wc_product_tables" capability can execute it and sanitizing the post title.
