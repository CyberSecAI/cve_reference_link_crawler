- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A change introduced in Apache Flink 1.11.0 allowed attackers to read arbitrary files on the local filesystem of the JobManager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability through the REST API of the JobManager process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can read any file on the local filesystem of the JobManager. Access is restricted to files accessible by the JobManager process.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is performed through the REST interface of the JobManager process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the REST interface of the JobManager process.
