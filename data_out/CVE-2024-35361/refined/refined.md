The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35361.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection in the `/LinkStore/getIcon` endpoint of MTab Bookmark V1.9.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `url` parameter in the request body.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL statement execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/LinkStore/getIcon` endpoint.
- The `url` parameter within the JSON request body is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable MTab Bookmark application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The provided PoC uses sleep commands, indicating that the attacker can confirm the SQL injection is successful and extract more data.
