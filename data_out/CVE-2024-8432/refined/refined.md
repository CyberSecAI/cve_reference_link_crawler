### Summary
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Appointment & Event Booking Calendar Plugin â€“ Webba Booking" WordPress plugin, specifically related to a missing authorization check in the `save_appearance()` function, allowing authenticated users with minimal subscriber-level access to modify the plugin's CSS settings.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause of the vulnerability is the absence of a proper capability check within the `save_appearance()` function of the plugin. This function is responsible for saving CSS changes made to the booking form's appearance. Due to the missing authorization, even low-privileged authenticated users can access this functionality and make modifications.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization**: The core weakness is the lack of an authorization check, making the function accessible to unprivileged users.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The function operates on a direct object (CSS settings) without verifying user privileges.
### Impact of exploitation
- **CSS Modification**: An attacker can modify the booking form's CSS.
- **Possible Defacement**: By manipulating the CSS, an attacker could deface the booking form, disrupting the functionality or displaying malicious content.

### Attack vectors
- **Network**: The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Authentication Required**: The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site.
- **Low Privileges**: The attacker only needs subscriber-level privileges or higher.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
-  **Authenticated User**: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the affected WordPress website.
- **Subscriber Access or Higher**: The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level role on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
