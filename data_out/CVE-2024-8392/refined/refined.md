Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper control of the filename used in an include/require statement within the `panel.php` file of the Sogrid WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses the `$_GET['tab']` parameter to determine which file to include, without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin uses user-controlled input (`$_GET['tab']`) to construct the path to a file to include. Even though the `sanitize_file_name` function is used, it is not enough to prevent a directory traversal attack, because the function does not remove `..` sequences.
- **Lack of proper input validation/sanitization:** The `sanitize_file_name` function is insufficient to prevent attackers from including arbitrary local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server. This could lead to complete server compromise.
- **Bypass access controls:** Attackers can execute code outside the intended plugin functionality.
- **Data breach:** Attackers can obtain sensitive data from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The `tab` parameter in the URL is used to specify the file to include. For example: `wp-admin/admin.php?page=sogrid&tab=../../../../wp-config.php` (this is just an example and may require more traversal depending on the location of the plugin)
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** According to the information, this can be exploited through CSRF, meaning an attacker could craft a malicious link or page and trick an administrator into triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator-level access or higher:**  The attacker must be logged in as a WordPress administrator or a user with higher privileges to access the vulnerable page.
- **Knowledge of the plugin's structure:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `panel.php` file.
- **Knowledge of server file paths:**  The attacker needs to know or guess the paths of local files on the server.
