Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-46650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of sensitive information due to a misconfiguration that allows ACEManager credentials to be displayed on the pre-login status page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-200:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. The ACEManager credentials, which should be protected, are made visible on the pre-login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to ACEManager, which can lead to further malicious activities such as device reconfiguration, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
- Loss of confidentiality for credentials which could have further impact of system access
 
**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation. An attacker needs to have access to the device's web interface via the network.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the web interface and by configuring the device to expose the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the ACEManager interface and valid ACEManager credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to reconfigure the device to expose the credentials on the pre-login status page, which implies having higher access or control.
-  A user with valid ACEManager credentials and access to the ACEManager interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Sierra Wireless AirLink routers running ALEOS software.
- Specifically, the affected versions are:
    - Airlink Router (ES450, GX450) running ALEOS software: Versions 4.9.7 and prior
    - Airlink Router (MP70, RV50, RV50x, RV55, LX 40, LX60) running ALEOS software: Versions prior to 4.16.0
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). This indicates a vulnerability that is network exploitable, has low attack complexity, requires high privileges, and user interaction is required for successful exploitation. The impact is primarily on the confidentiality of the credentials.

The advisory also includes mitigations such as upgrading the ALEOS software to the latest version and applying network access control measures.
