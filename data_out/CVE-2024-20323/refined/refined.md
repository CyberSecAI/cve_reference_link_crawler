- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of hard-coded cryptographic material within Cisco Intelligent Node (iNode) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Static cryptographic keys are used for TLS connection between Cisco iNode Manager and associated intelligent nodes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can hijack the TLS connection, read data intended for legitimate devices, modify the startup configuration of associated nodes, and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for downstream devices.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco iNode Manager and associated deployed nodes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the traffic between the iNode Manager and associated nodes. The attacker must then use the static cryptographic key to generate a trusted certificate and impersonate the affected device.
