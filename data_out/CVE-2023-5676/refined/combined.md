### @babsingh **[babsingh](/babsingh)** commented [Sep 6, 2023](#issue-1884584536)

JVM init path: `J9_CreateJavaVM`.

JVM exit paths: `protectedDestroyJavaVM` and `exitJavaVM`.

A segfault or other side-effects can happen if the JVM init and

exit paths execute concurrently.

The exit path can be taken if a shutdown signal is raised and the

shutdown handler is invoked. JVM shutdown signals are `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`

and `SIGHUP`.

Preventing invocation of the exit path from the shutdown signal handler

until the JVM initialization completes resolves the above side-effects.

Signal handlers should not incorporate lock operations since they are not [signal-safe](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html). I have replaced the lock with a read barrier to read the most up-to-date `vm->runtimeFlags` value.

# technology.openj9 Don't invoke shutdown signal handler until JVM init completes

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** OpenJ9

**Project id:** technology.openj9

**Request type:** Reservation

**Versions affected:** [Initial - 0.41.0)

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* [CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/364.html)

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS 4.1)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1)

**Summary:**

In Eclipse OpenJ9 before version 0.41.0, the JVM can be forced into an infinite busy hang on a spinlock or a segmentation fault if a shutdown signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGHUP) is received before the JVM has finished initializing.

**Links:**

* <https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/18085>

## Tracking

**This section will completed by the project team**.

* Reserve an entry only ... our release is still pending
* We're ready for this issue to be reported to the central authority (i.e., make this public now)
* (when applicable) The GitHub Security Advisory is ready to be published now

Note that for those projects that host their repositories on GitHub, the use of GitHub Security Advisories is recommended but is not required.

**This section will be completed by the EMO**.

**CVE:** {cve}

* All required information is provided
* CVE Assigned
* Pushed to Mitre
