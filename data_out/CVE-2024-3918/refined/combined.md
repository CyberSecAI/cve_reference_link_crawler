## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pet Manager <= 1.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Pet settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Pets > Add Pet"
2. In the "Address" field add the payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
3. Save and reload to see the XSS
