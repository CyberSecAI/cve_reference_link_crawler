{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `httpd` service in vivotek SD9364 does not validate the `Content-Length` field of HTTP requests, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow due to lack of length check on the `Content-Length` field in HTTP requests.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can write arbitrary data to the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through sending a crafted HTTP request with an overly long `Content-Length` field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service."
