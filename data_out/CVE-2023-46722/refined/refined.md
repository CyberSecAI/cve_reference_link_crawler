Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of PDF content within the Pimcore admin UI, specifically when previewing PDF documents. The application does not properly neutralize or encode JavaScript found within the PDF before rendering it, leading to potential execution of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the injected JavaScript from a crafted PDF is executed when a user previews the document within the admin interface.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the content of PDF files before rendering, allowing potentially malicious JavaScript to be injected and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker could inject JavaScript code in a PDF file, that when previewed by a victim, could steal the victim's session cookie.
- **Account Takeover:** By stealing the session cookie, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** The attacker could also use the XSS vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Potential for other malicious activities**: Although not described in this document, the attacker may perform additional malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Upload of Malicious PDF:** An attacker uploads a crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript code through the document management feature in the admin panel.
- **Preview of PDF:** When an authorized user previews the uploaded PDF, the embedded JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Pimcore Admin:** The attacker needs to have access to the Pimcore admin panel to be able to upload a malicious PDF document.
- **Ability to Upload Documents:** Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to upload documents.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker must know how to craft a malicious PDF with JavaScript payloads to exploit the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also includes the fix for this issue. It introduces a new system configuration to scan PDF documents for unsafe Javascript, and sets a custom setting on the asset object to keep track of the scan status. Additionally, changes are added to the AssetController.php to check the scan status before rendering a PDF preview.
- The patch introduces logic to detect the presence of `/JS` or `/JavaScript` within the PDF file by reading it in chunks.
- The patch also adds UI elements to inform the user when a PDF is being scanned and when a PDF is determined to be unsafe.
- The fix includes a commit in the `pimcore/pimcore` repository that implements the PDF scanning logic, and a commit in the `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` repository that updates the frontend to handle the new scan status.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.0 of `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle`.
