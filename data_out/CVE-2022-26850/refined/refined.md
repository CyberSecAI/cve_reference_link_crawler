Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-26850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration file to the operating system's temporary directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The Login Identity Providers configuration file, which contains the username and a bcrypt hash of the password, was briefly written to a temporary directory before being moved to its final location.
- **Global Read Permissions on Temporary Directory:**  Operating system temporary directories typically have global read permissions, making the temporary file accessible to other users on the system during that brief window.
- **Insufficient File Handling:** The process of moving the temporary file to the final configuration directory, while limiting the exposure window, did not prevent the temporary file from being created in the first place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credentials Exposure:** An attacker with local access to the system could potentially read the temporary file and gain access to the bcrypt hash of the single-user password. Even though the password was hashed with bcrypt, access to the hash could potentially allow an attacker to conduct an offline brute-force attack if the password was weak.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local File System Access:** An attacker would need to have local access to the server running Apache NiFi and the ability to read files in the operating system's temporary directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Apache NiFi is running.
- **Knowledge of Temporary Directory:** The attacker must know the location of the operating system's temporary directory.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to act within the window of opportunity before the file is moved to its final location. Though it should be noted that the window was described as limited.

**Additional Notes**

- The issue was mitigated in NiFi 1.16.0 by replacing the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing to the OS temporary directory.
- The use of bcrypt for password hashing reduces the risk associated with password disclosure.
- The severity of this vulnerability was rated as **Low** because the exposure window is limited and an attacker needs local access.
