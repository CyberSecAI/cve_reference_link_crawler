Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-48649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of uploaded file names within the Concrete CMS admin page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the potential for stored XSS due to unsanitized file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the file name. This code would then be executed when an administrator views the file in the admin panel, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement or unauthorized actions within the application context

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the Concrete CMS admin page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have at least low-level access (e.g. a logged-in user with file upload privileges) to the Concrete CMS admin panel to upload files with malicious names.
- The attacker needs to convince a privileged user (e.g. administrator) to view the uploaded file within the admin panel to trigger the XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 score of 3.5 with the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
- The fix involved sanitizing uploaded file names to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
- This vulnerability is fixed in Concrete CMS versions 9.2.2 and 8.5.13.
