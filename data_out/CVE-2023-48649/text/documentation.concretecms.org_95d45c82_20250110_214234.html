**Improvements?**

Let us know
[by posting here](https://forums.concretecms.org/c/documentation/24).

## Behavioral Improvements

* CKEditor included version has been updated to the latest version 4.22.1 (thanks hissy)
* Updating some automatically created directories to use the proper directory permissions (thanks mlocati)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where Express association control would be required if present in form even if the admin hadn’t marked it as required (thanks yildirimmurat)
* Fixed link to user profile from Communty authentication (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed some instances where the CollectionSearchIndexAttributes table might be updated based on the latest version instead of the approved version (thanks biplobice)
* Fixed: Gettext uses deprecated array\_key\_exists() which throws a ConversionException on PHP 7.4 (thanks 1stthomas, mlocati)
* We now properly sanitize the output of files uploaded through Express Forms.

## Backward Compatibility Notes

## Developer Updates

* Avoid installing commerceguys/addressing 1.4+ because it’s incompatible with PHP 7.3 (thanks mlocati)

## Security Fixes

* Better sanitization of Plural handles in Express objects.
* Better sanitizing of Custom labels in Express objects.
* Updated to Guzzle 6.5.8 to ensure Concrete CMS is not vulnerable to Guzzle [CVE-2023-29197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29197) Thank you Danilo Costa for reporting H1 2132287
* Fixed  Directories could be created with insecure permissions since file creation functions gave universal access (0777) to created folders by default. Excessive permissions could be granted when creating a directory with permissions greater than 0755 or when the permissions argument was not specified. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 6.6 (Medium) with CVSS v3 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1) Thanks tahabiyikli-vortex for reporting H12122245. Thanks Mlocati for providing the fix. Fixed in commit [11739](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11739)
* Fixed [CVE-2023-28477](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28477) stored XSS on API Integrations via the name parameter in the 8.5 version. Previous fix was in version 9 only. Prior to the fix, while adding API Integrations on Concrete CMS, the parameter name accepted special characters enabling malicious JavaScript payloads impacting /dashboard/system/api/integrations and /dashboard/system/api/integrations/view\_client/unique-id. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 5.5 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Veshraj Ghimire for reporting H1 1753684 and providing the original fix.

* Fixed [CVE-2023-28475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28475) Concrete was vulnerable to reflected XSS on the Reply form because msgID was not sanitized in the 8.5 version. Previous fix was in version 9 only. Concrete CMS Team ranked this 4.2 (medium) With CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks again Bogdan Tiron for the discovery. Fixed with [commit](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/861ba66d248165c9ee9d6d11a0457908b97d68f0)

* Fixed [CVE-2023-28819](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28819) in version 8.5. Previously remediated in Concrete 9.1. Concrete was vulnerable to stored XSS in uploaded file and folder names since Concrete CMS was rendering data without sanitizing it. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 3.5 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1). Thanks solov9ev for reporting H1 1472270. Fixed with commit [11749](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11749)
* Fixed [CVE-2023-28472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28472) in version 8.5 by updating the Survey Block Controller. We added support for the concrete.session.cookie.cookie\_secure value to the ccmPoll cookie (which developers can set to true if they want to use secure cookies.

* Fixed [CVE-2023-28473](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28473) possible Auth bypass in the jobs section in version 8.5. This was previously remediated in Concrete 9.2. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2.2 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Adrian Tiron from Fortbridge for Reporting H1 1772230.
