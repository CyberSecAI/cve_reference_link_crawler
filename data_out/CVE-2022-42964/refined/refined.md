- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability exists in the `pymatgen` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the `GaussianInput.from_string` method, which is susceptible to a regular expression denial-of-service attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing crafted input to the vulnerable method, which leads to excessive resource consumption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through supplying arbitrary input to the `GaussianInput.from_string` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide arbitrary input to the vulnerable `GaussianInput.from_string` method.
