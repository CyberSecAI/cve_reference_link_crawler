  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authorization, CSRF vulnerability (implicit).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can change the custom admin slug, potentially causing confusion or disrupting site access if the attacker sets an unusual slug.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` with the `custom_wpadmin_slug` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need network access to the vulnerable website."
