### [Does not seem to be compatible with PHP 8.0](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-seem-to-be-compatible-with-php-8-0/)

The error thrown out is:
Fatal error: Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is no longer supported in [PATH]/wp-content/plugins/shorten-url/core/utils.class.php on line 102 site:wordpress.org
Simply inactivating the plugin will also inactivate all the short urls you made. You will thus have to install a compatible alternative and recreate all the old short URLs.

We installed this plugin a while back, it hasn’t been updated since. I started looking into server performance issues and was shocked to see the errors this plugin causes.

### [Poor performance, bloated inferface](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/poor-performance-bloated-inferface/)

[MrBrian](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrbrian/ "Posts by MrBrian")
September 3, 2016

This plugin is poorly optimized – it will slow down your server and browser page load unnecessarily.
There’s no reason to attempt to modify the content/excerpt if the “Automatic shorten links in article” option is disabled – this easily translates to hundreds of calls to function ‘replace\_by\_short\_link’ (1 SQL query each) = SLOW SERVER. Also, a short link is created in the database for every page/post despite setting shortlink ‘types’ – this can easily create a very large database table unnecessarily.
If not making use of displaying the short URL automatically, does not stop the CSS style from being loaded into the page header = SLOWER PAGE LOAD.
The adding of a parent menu called “SL Plugins” is bloated and ugly.
Finally, you do not create an instance of your class (which is best coding practice) so that I can at least remove actions/filters for better performance. Giving this 2 stars until improved.

### Description

The Short URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'comment' parameter due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
