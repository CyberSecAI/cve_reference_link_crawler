- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the lack of proper checks allows unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific privileges are required. Any unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
