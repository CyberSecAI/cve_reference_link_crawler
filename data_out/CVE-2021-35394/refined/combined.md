CVE-2021-35395

Description

rtl819x-SDK-v3.4T-CT Series

R ealtek

On  some  Realtek Jungle SDK  based  routers,  potential  memory  corruption  vulnerabilities  in  some

services may cause their denial of the service.

  CVE-2021-35392/CVE-2021-35393

The  ‘WiFi  Simple  Config’  server  (wscd)  that  implements  both  UPnP  and  SSDP  protocols  is

vulnerable  to  a  stack  buffer  overflow  (CVE-2021-35393)  due  to  unsafe  parsing  of  the  UPnP

SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Callback header, and also a heap buffer overflow (CVE-2021-35392)

due to unsafe crafting of SSDP NOTIFY messages from received M-SEARCH message’s ST header.

  CVE-2021-35394

The  ‘UDPServer’  MP  tool  is  affected  by  multiple  buffer  overflow  vulnerabilities  and  an  arbitrary

command  injection  vulnerability,  due  to  insufficient  legality  detection  on  commands  received  from

clients.

  CVE-2021-35395

The HTTP web server ‘boa’ (go-ahead has been obsoleted) is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows

due to unsafe copies of some overly long parameters submitted in the form, such as

- unsafe copy of ‘submit-url’ parameter in formRebootCheck/formWsc/formWlanMultipleAP

- unsafe copy of ‘ifname’ parameter in formWlSiteSurvey

- unsafe copy of ‘hostname’ parameter in formStaticDHCP

- unsafe copy of ‘peerPin’ parameter in formWsc

The root cause of the above vulnerabilities is insufficient validation on the received buffer, and unsafe

calls to sprintf/strcpy. An attack can exploit the vulnerabilities by crafting arguments in a specific request,

and a successful exploit would cause the server to crash and deny service.
