Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The 'UDPServer' MP tool within the Realtek AP-Router SDK suffers from multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities and an arbitrary command injection vulnerability. This is due to insufficient validation of commands received from clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Multiple Buffer Overflows:** The UDPServer tool is prone to buffer overflows, meaning that by sending overly long input, an attacker can write data beyond the allocated memory boundaries of a buffer.
*  **Arbitrary Command Injection:** The UDPServer tool is vulnerable to command injection. This means that by sending specially crafted commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system, due to the tool not properly validating user input before using it to construct system commands

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit of the buffer overflows can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  A successful command injection attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attacks are launched over the network by sending malicious commands to the UDPServer tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the UDPServer tool over the network. This implies that the attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
* The attacker must also be able to craft specific commands or arguments in the request to exploit the weaknesses.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected products are within the Realtek AP-Router SDK.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the SDK including: rtl819x-SDK-v3.2.x Series, rtl819x-SDK-v3.4.x Series, rtl819x-SDK-v3.4T Series, and rtl819x-eCos-v1.5.x Series
*   Realtek has provided patches to address this vulnerability, along with CVE-2021-35392, CVE-2021-35393, and CVE-2021-35395.
