- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RSVP and Event Management plugin lacks authorization checks when exporting entries. The export function is hooked to the `init` action, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, broken access control (OWASP A5). Specifically, the plugin does not verify user permissions before allowing the export of event registration data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve personally identifiable information (PII) such as first names, last names, and email addresses of users registered for events.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=rsvp-admin-export` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin's endpoint for exporting entries.
