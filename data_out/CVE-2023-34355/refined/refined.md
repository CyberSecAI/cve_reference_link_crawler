Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Uncontrolled search path element in the Intel Server Board BMC video drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from how the BMC video drivers search for necessary components or libraries. An uncontrolled search path means that the drivers may be tricked into loading malicious code from a location controlled by the attacker, instead of the intended legitimate files.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, potentially granting an attacker higher-level access to the system. This can allow them to execute arbitrary code, modify system settings, and potentially take full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:** Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An authenticated user needs local access to the affected system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to write malicious files to locations that the uncontrolled search path will access.

**Affected Products:**

*   Intel® Server Board M10JNP2SB Integrated BMC Video Drivers before version 3.0 for Microsoft Windows
*   Intel® Server Board M10JNP2SB Integrated BMC Video Drivers before version 1.13.4 for Linux
