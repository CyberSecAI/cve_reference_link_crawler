- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation during the establishment of secure connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of certificate verification (CWE-295).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network-adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, potentially leading to information disclosure. The CVSS score indicates a medium severity with potential impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network adjacent attackers performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept and alter communication between the affected products and external peers. The attacker does not need any prior authentication. The user interaction is required, according to the CVSS score.
