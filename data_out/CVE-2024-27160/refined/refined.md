  "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the use of hardcoded credentials within the firmware of Toshiba and Oki Electric Industry MFPs. Specifically, a hardcoded password is used to encrypt logs, with a weak digest cipher. An attacker with access to the affected product could obtain sensitive information, including the ability to decrypt encrypted log files.  Additionally, there is a vulnerability to bypass authentication mechanism by uploading a .htaccess file."
