Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10118:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2017-10118 in multiple locations:

*   Oracle's Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017 explicitly lists "CVE-2017-10118" and credits "Daniel Bleichenbacher of Google" for its report.
*   Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:1790 and RHSA-2017:1791 includes CVE-2017-10118 in the list of fixed vulnerabilities for java-1.8.0-oracle and java-1.7.0-oracle packages respectively.
*   Debian Security Advisories DSA-3954-1 and DSA-3919-1 mention CVE-2017-10118 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in their respective openjdk-7 and openjdk-8 packages.
*   NetApp advisory NTAP-20170720-0001 includes CVE-2017-10118 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed for multiple NetApp products.
*   Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201709-22 lists CVE-2017-10118 among vulnerabilities addressed in Oracle JDK/JRE and IcedTea.
*   CERT@VDE advisory VDE-2017-002 mentions CVE-2017-10118 in relation to mGuard device manager.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability is within the "JCE" (Java Cryptography Extension) component of Oracle Java SE, Java SE Embedded, and JRockit.
    *   It stems from a timing attack in the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) implementation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Timing Attack:** The vulnerability is a timing attack, meaning an attacker can potentially infer secret information by observing the time it takes for cryptographic operations to complete. This allows for possible information disclosure.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** Some of the sources also mention "Improper Access Control" but that might be related to other CVEs patched.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An unauthenticated attacker with network access can exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (High Confidentiality impact, as per CVSS).
    *   The Oracle advisory notes that this vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets, or by supplying data to APIs without the use of these technologies.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise (takeover) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, or JRockit instances.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network access:** The attack vector is over the network using multiple protocols.
    *   **Multiple Protocols:** Multiple protocols may be used by the attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **Sandboxed Java Applications:**  The vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets.
    *   **Direct API calls:** It can be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified component, such as through a web service, without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Network Access:** An unauthenticated attacker with network access can exploit this vulnerability
    *   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote as it is over the network using multiple protocols.
    *   **No User Interaction Required:** Some sources indicate that no user interaction is required, which means the attack can be completely remote. However, some sources indicate user interaction might be required for certain exploits.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided sources highlight that this vulnerability affects multiple versions of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, and JRockit.
*   The severity is marked as "High" with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
*   Patches for this vulnerability are included in Oracle's July 2017 CPU.
*   Red Hat, Debian, NetApp, Gentoo and VDE also provide their respective patches.

In summary, CVE-2017-10118 is a serious vulnerability affecting Java SE, Java SE Embedded, and JRockit implementations due to a timing attack within the ECDSA implementation. It allows for unauthorized access to sensitive data and can lead to complete takeover. This is a remote exploit and requires applying the relevant patches.
