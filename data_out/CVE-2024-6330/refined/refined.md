- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GEO my WordPress plugin fails to prevent unauthenticated attackers from including arbitrary files in PHP's execution context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and PHAR Deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file inclusion can lead to remote code execution on the server. Attackers can also use PHAR deserialization to achieve code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint by sending a crafted request with the `gmw_info_window_init` action and a `content_path` parameter pointing to a local file or a PHAR archive.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication. They can send the crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint from any location on the internet, as long as the affected site is reachable. The `object_id` parameter needs to be a valid parameter for successful exploitation.
