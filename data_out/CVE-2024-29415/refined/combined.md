[#138](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/138) does not completely fix [CVE-2023-42282](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22 "CVE-2023-42282").

Some examples quoted from the failing tests added here:

* `127.1`, `127.0.1`, `127.00.0x1`, `127.0.0x0.1`
* `01200034567`: `Number('01200034567') === 1200034567` while `01200034567 === 167786871` in JavaScript, suprise!
* `012.1.2.3`: `ip.isV6Format('012.1.2.3') === true`, so it's not normalized :)
* `fe80::0001`, we can have leading zeros, and, more: `000:0:0000::01`, `000:0:0000:0:000:0:00:001`
* `::fFFf:127.0.0.1`: there are `/i` in many places, but not here

---

Now I think we need a new CVE. A quick way to get one is to open a security advisory in this repository. [@indutny](https://github.com/indutny) Could you please [enable private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)? Or does anyone know whether it is possible to properly revoke the "patched version" in the previous CVE? (Based on the activity level of this repository, the existence of the previous CVE, and the number of uncovered cases, I chose public disclosure here.)

~~UPD: I'm not sure whether editing the advisory or requesting a new CVE is more appreciated, also wondering how Dependabot would react to this modification, but I opened [github/advisory-database#3617](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3617).~~

---

See [#144](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144) for my new attempt to fix it.

---

IP address handling is hard. ~~I'm not sure how to properly implement it based on the current codes. (Note that my tests are still not exhaustive.) Maybe we should actually *parse* the addresses instead of relying on regular expressions.~~ I didn't notice the `toBuffer` function. Maybe we should fix it and use it for other functions.

Also, the semantics of the functions on invalid addresses seem unclear and inconsistent. I suggest a new major release (v3) to change some return values on invalid addresses. Maybe also fix [#61](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/61) there.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The root problem is the API design. The API should return the normalized parsing result and the user should use that result instead of the original possibly ill-formed one. Otherwise, there are always potential parser differences, e.g. the address `012.1.2.3` is later used somewhere in the user's codes, where it is parsed as `12.1.2.3`. |

| Maybe we should just reject malformed addresses. And we can use `net.isIPv4` and `net.isIPv6` in Node instead of our own version. |

| Description The problem described in [CVE-2023-42282](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22 "CVE-2023-42282") is not completely fixed in v2.0.1 and v1.1.9. The `isPublic()` function still identifies some private IP addresses as public. This may lead to SSRF attacks if the `isPublic()`/`isPrivate()`/`isLoopback()` functions are used to guard outgoing network requests. PoC See [#143](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143)   * `127.1`, `127.0.1`, `127.00.0x1`, `127.0.0x0.1` * `01200034567` * `012.1.2.3` * `fe80::0001`, `000:0:0000::01`, `000:0:0000:0:000:0:00:001` * `::fFFf:127.0.0.1`  Patches No patch has been applied to the original package yet.  A patch has been proposed at [#144](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144). Suggestions The `ip` package is not actively maintained. The author is not responsive.  Users of this package are advised to use alternative packages with similar functions even if their use of the `ip` package is not affected by this vulnerability, in order to get better support and avoid other potential vulnerabilities and bugs.  Alternatively, users may check their usage of the `isPublic()`/`isPrivate()`/`isLoopback()` functions to see if they are used to guard sensitive network requests (e.g. check whether the IP address provided in user input is private or public before sending out a request to it). Also follow the [Server Side Request Forgery Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). It's likely that even a correctly implemented `isPublic()` function is not enough to prevent SSRF attacks. |

| To be clear, GitHub identifies this as a high-severity issue in [GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp "GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp"), but it depends on the actual use case. I think it's none or low in most cases, moderate in some cases, and rarely of high severity. You may read the suggestions above. However, I think the lack of maintenance of this package is arguably more severe than this CVE itself. |

| Won't help in every case but looks useful in mine: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-in-subnet>  Edit: Full disclosure, no association with this project and I'll note it has a much, **much** smaller user base. Caveat emptor.  Edit 2: Also some disagreement on what a "private subnet" is between libs so this may not be a 1:1 replacement. |

| [@inquinity](https://github.com/inquinity) I was looking into the package you proposed and tried to come up with a replacement for `ip.isPublic`. However, the package seems to lack knowledge about special IPv4 subnets and private IPv6 addresses.  Here's what I came up with so far. Did I miss something?  Code not tested.  ``` import ip from 'ip-address'  const ip4LoopbackSubnet = new ip.Address4('127.0.0.0/8') const ip4LinkLocalSubnet = new ip.Address4('169.254.0.0/16') const ip4PrivateASubnet = new ip.Address4('10.0.0.0/8') const ip4PrivateBSubnet = new ip.Address4('172.16.0.0/12') const ip4PrivateCSubnet = new ip.Address4('192.168.0.0/16')  const isPublicIp = (   address: string ): boolean => {   try {     // Throws if address is not a valid IPv4 address     const instance = new ip.Address4(address)     // Exclude non-host IP addresses     if (instance.subnetMask < 32) {       return false     }     // Exclude non-public IPv4 addresses     if (       instance.isInSubnet(ip4LoopbackSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4LinkLocalSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateASubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateBSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateCSubnet)     ) {       return false     }     return true   } catch (error: unknown) {     //   }   try {     // Throws if address is not a valid IPv6 address     const instance = new ip.Address6(address)     // Exclude non-host IP addresses     if (instance.subnetMask < 128) {       return false     }     // Exclude non-public IPv6 addresses     // TODO: Private IPv6 addresses     if (instance.isLinkLocal() || instance.isLoopback()) {       return false     }     return true   } catch (error: unknown) {     //   }   return false } ``` |

| Thank you so much [@mikehall314](https://github.com/mikehall314), we are maintaining an old project and we added the fork to the resolutions to fix the issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è  As a workaround, this is what we added in our package.json, until this is fixed:  ```   "resolutions": {     "**/ip": "https://registry.npmjs.org/neoip/-/neoip-2.1.0.tgz"   } ``` |

| <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip-address>  Is the IP package issue already resolved? If so, can some one please share the corrected version number? I am using npm 10.8.1 and IP version 2.0.1 but still facing the issue. What's the best alternative package (net/ip-address)? Thanks. |

### @ouuan **[ouuan](/ouuan)** commented [Feb 21, 2024](#issue-2146195723)

See [#143](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143). Given the current API of this library, I believe that it's not suitable to support malformed addresses like `0x7f.1`. It's hard to parse them correctly in all cases. It's better to throw errors for them.

This PR uses the Node.js `net` library so it should be reliable.

I suggest releasing v3 after merging this, because:

1. `net.SocketAddress` is added in Node v15.14.0 and v14.18.0. I think it's reasonable to drop support for older Node versions because Node 12 has reached end-of-life since 2022-04-30. If the user cares about security, they should use a new Node version.
2. I would consider throwing new errors as a breaking change.
3. Dropping support for malformed addresses could also be a breaking change.

We could try to (partially) fix the security concerns in a compatible way in v2 (and v1) in another pull request.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I came across a couple of maintained forks of `node-ip`:   * <https://github.com/eggjs/node-ip> * <https://github.com/zaptic/neoip>   Both forks are a few months old, so there's not enough activity for me to tell whether they're likely to be maintained in the long term. That said, they may be a good solution for folks who aren't yet ready to switch to an alternative. |

| [@charIeszhao](https://github.com/charIeszhao) why are you pinging me? i'm not a maintainer here.  Sorry, I think that was a mistake. I saw you were the reviewer so I assumed you were the maintainer. My appologies for the ping. |
