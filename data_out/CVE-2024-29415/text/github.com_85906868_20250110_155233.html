| Description The problem described in [CVE-2023-42282](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22 "CVE-2023-42282") is not completely fixed in v2.0.1 and v1.1.9. The `isPublic()` function still identifies some private IP addresses as public. This may lead to SSRF attacks if the `isPublic()`/`isPrivate()`/`isLoopback()` functions are used to guard outgoing network requests. PoC See [#143](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143)   * `127.1`, `127.0.1`, `127.00.0x1`, `127.0.0x0.1` * `01200034567` * `012.1.2.3` * `fe80::0001`, `000:0:0000::01`, `000:0:0000:0:000:0:00:001` * `::fFFf:127.0.0.1`  Patches No patch has been applied to the original package yet.  A patch has been proposed at [#144](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144). Suggestions The `ip` package is not actively maintained. The author is not responsive.  Users of this package are advised to use alternative packages with similar functions even if their use of the `ip` package is not affected by this vulnerability, in order to get better support and avoid other potential vulnerabilities and bugs.  Alternatively, users may check their usage of the `isPublic()`/`isPrivate()`/`isLoopback()` functions to see if they are used to guard sensitive network requests (e.g. check whether the IP address provided in user input is private or public before sending out a request to it). Also follow the [Server Side Request Forgery Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). It's likely that even a correctly implemented `isPublic()` function is not enough to prevent SSRF attacks. |

| To be clear, GitHub identifies this as a high-severity issue in [GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp "GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp"), but it depends on the actual use case. I think it's none or low in most cases, moderate in some cases, and rarely of high severity. You may read the suggestions above. However, I think the lack of maintenance of this package is arguably more severe than this CVE itself. |

| Unrelated to SSRF attacks, though behavior I did not expect: `ip.isPublic('')` evaluates to `true` because of the way it internally calls `!ip.isPrivate('')`. |

| Won't help in every case but looks useful in mine: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-in-subnet>  Edit: Full disclosure, no association with this project and I'll note it has a much, **much** smaller user base. Caveat emptor.  Edit 2: Also some disagreement on what a "private subnet" is between libs so this may not be a 1:1 replacement. |

| [@inquinity](https://github.com/inquinity) I was looking into the package you proposed and tried to come up with a replacement for `ip.isPublic`. However, the package seems to lack knowledge about special IPv4 subnets and private IPv6 addresses.  Here's what I came up with so far. Did I miss something?  Code not tested.  ``` import ip from 'ip-address'  const ip4LoopbackSubnet = new ip.Address4('127.0.0.0/8') const ip4LinkLocalSubnet = new ip.Address4('169.254.0.0/16') const ip4PrivateASubnet = new ip.Address4('10.0.0.0/8') const ip4PrivateBSubnet = new ip.Address4('172.16.0.0/12') const ip4PrivateCSubnet = new ip.Address4('192.168.0.0/16')  const isPublicIp = (   address: string ): boolean => {   try {     // Throws if address is not a valid IPv4 address     const instance = new ip.Address4(address)     // Exclude non-host IP addresses     if (instance.subnetMask < 32) {       return false     }     // Exclude non-public IPv4 addresses     if (       instance.isInSubnet(ip4LoopbackSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4LinkLocalSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateASubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateBSubnet) ||       instance.isInSubnet(ip4PrivateCSubnet)     ) {       return false     }     return true   } catch (error: unknown) {     //   }   try {     // Throws if address is not a valid IPv6 address     const instance = new ip.Address6(address)     // Exclude non-host IP addresses     if (instance.subnetMask < 128) {       return false     }     // Exclude non-public IPv6 addresses     // TODO: Private IPv6 addresses     if (instance.isLinkLocal() || instance.isLoopback()) {       return false     }     return true   } catch (error: unknown) {     //   }   return false } ``` |

| I trust this isn't bad form, but I have forked this repo and published a fix.  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/neoip>  The 2.x release should be drop-in compatible with this library. The 3.x release has been refactored internally to avoid this class of problems, but has a slightly different API.  If it is bad form to mention here, please delete this comment. |

| Thank you so much [@mikehall314](https://github.com/mikehall314), we are maintaining an old project and we added the fork to the resolutions to fix the issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è  As a workaround, this is what we added in our package.json, until this is fixed:  ```   "resolutions": {     "**/ip": "https://registry.npmjs.org/neoip/-/neoip-2.1.0.tgz"   } ``` |

| <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip-address>  Is the IP package issue already resolved? If so, can some one please share the corrected version number? I am using npm 10.8.1 and IP version 2.0.1 but still facing the issue. What's the best alternative package (net/ip-address)? Thanks. |
