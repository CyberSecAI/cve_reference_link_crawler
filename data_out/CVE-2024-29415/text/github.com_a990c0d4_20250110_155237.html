### @ouuan **[ouuan](/ouuan)** commented [Feb 21, 2024](#issue-2146195723)

See [#143](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143). Given the current API of this library, I believe that it's not suitable to support malformed addresses like `0x7f.1`. It's hard to parse them correctly in all cases. It's better to throw errors for them.

This PR uses the Node.js `net` library so it should be reliable.

I suggest releasing v3 after merging this, because:

1. `net.SocketAddress` is added in Node v15.14.0 and v14.18.0. I think it's reasonable to drop support for older Node versions because Node 12 has reached end-of-life since 2022-04-30. If the user cares about security, they should use a new Node version.
2. I would consider throwing new errors as a breaking change.
3. Dropping support for malformed addresses could also be a breaking change.

We could try to (partially) fix the security concerns in a compatible way in v2 (and v1) in another pull request.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I came across a couple of maintained forks of `node-ip`:   * <https://github.com/eggjs/node-ip> * <https://github.com/zaptic/neoip>   Both forks are a few months old, so there's not enough activity for me to tell whether they're likely to be maintained in the long term. That said, they may be a good solution for folks who aren't yet ready to switch to an alternative. |
