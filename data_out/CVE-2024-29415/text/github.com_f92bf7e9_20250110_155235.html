[#138](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/138) does not completely fix [CVE-2023-42282](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22 "CVE-2023-42282").

Some examples quoted from the failing tests added here:

* `127.1`, `127.0.1`, `127.00.0x1`, `127.0.0x0.1`
* `01200034567`: `Number('01200034567') === 1200034567` while `01200034567 === 167786871` in JavaScript, suprise!
* `012.1.2.3`: `ip.isV6Format('012.1.2.3') === true`, so it's not normalized :)
* `fe80::0001`, we can have leading zeros, and, more: `000:0:0000::01`, `000:0:0000:0:000:0:00:001`
* `::fFFf:127.0.0.1`: there are `/i` in many places, but not here

---

Now I think we need a new CVE. A quick way to get one is to open a security advisory in this repository. [@indutny](https://github.com/indutny) Could you please [enable private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)? Or does anyone know whether it is possible to properly revoke the "patched version" in the previous CVE? (Based on the activity level of this repository, the existence of the previous CVE, and the number of uncovered cases, I chose public disclosure here.)

~~UPD: I'm not sure whether editing the advisory or requesting a new CVE is more appreciated, also wondering how Dependabot would react to this modification, but I opened [github/advisory-database#3617](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3617).~~

---

See [#144](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144) for my new attempt to fix it.

---

IP address handling is hard. ~~I'm not sure how to properly implement it based on the current codes. (Note that my tests are still not exhaustive.) Maybe we should actually *parse* the addresses instead of relying on regular expressions.~~ I didn't notice the `toBuffer` function. Maybe we should fix it and use it for other functions.

Also, the semantics of the functions on invalid addresses seem unclear and inconsistent. I suggest a new major release (v3) to change some return values on invalid addresses. Maybe also fix [#61](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/61) there.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The root problem is the API design. The API should return the normalized parsing result and the user should use that result instead of the original possibly ill-formed one. Otherwise, there are always potential parser differences, e.g. the address `012.1.2.3` is later used somewhere in the user's codes, where it is parsed as `12.1.2.3`. |

| Maybe we should just reject malformed addresses. And we can use `net.isIPv4` and `net.isIPv6` in Node instead of our own version. |
