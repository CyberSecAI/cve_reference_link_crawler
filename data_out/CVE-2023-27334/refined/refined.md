Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the Softing products handle OPC UA ConditionRefresh requests. Specifically, sending a large number of these requests exhausts the server's resources. Additionally, the Softing advisory also mentions that sending a large number of method call requests with an array of methods to execute can lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper resource management when processing OPC UA ConditionRefresh requests or method call requests with a large array of methods to execute.
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-400, highlighting the server's failure to control the amount of resources it consumes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwhelming the server with a large number of requests, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition. The server may become unresponsive or crash, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can send malicious requests over a network connection.
*   **OPC UA Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered via the OPC UA protocol using specific requests (ConditionRefresh or method call requests).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be physically present on the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication to the OPC UA server.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.

**Affected Products:**
*   Softing OPC UA C++ SDK <= 6.20
*   Softing edgeConnector <= V3.60
*  Softing edgeAggregator <= V3.60
*   Softing Secure Integration Server <= V1.22

**Mitigation:**
*   Disable unauthenticated sessions to the OPC UA server, as the attack requires an established session.
*   Upgrade to the fixed versions:
    *   Softing OPC UA C++ SDK V6.20.1
    *   Softing edgeConnector V3.70
    *   Softing edgeAggregator V3.70
    *   Softing Secure Integration Server V1.30

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2022-10-14.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Softing on 2023-02-22 and publicly disclosed on 2023-08-09
* The vulnerability was discovered by Claroty Research - Team82.
* Softing issued a fix for edgeConnector, edgeAggregator and Secure Integration Server on 2023-11-30

This information provides more detail than the original CVE description, specifically about how method call requests can be used in addition to the ConditionRefresh requests to trigger the vulnerability and also provides the mitigation.
