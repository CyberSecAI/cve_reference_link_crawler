Based on the provided document, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2022-2967:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Prosys OPC UA Simulation server does not sufficiently protect user credentials.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522). The software fails to adequately safeguard user credentials, making them accessible to attackers.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain user credentials and gain access to system data. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potentially control of the affected systems.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have some level of access to the system. Attack complexity is low
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges and the user needs to perform an action.

**Additional details:**

*   The affected products include Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server versions prior to 5.3.0-64 and Prosys OPC UA Modbus Server 1.4.18-5 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The advisory mentions that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   The advisory suggests updating to Simulation Server v5.4.0 and Modbus Server v1.4.20, and recommends restarting the application after modifying user passwords as mitigation.
*   The advisory also provides general recommendations for securing control systems, such as minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and employing VPNs for remote access.
