Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server does not adequately protect user credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** The application fails to properly secure stored credentials, making them accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can obtain user credentials.
*   The attacker can gain unauthorized access to system data.
*   The attacker can potentially manipulate or disrupt the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker would need local access to the system where the server is running.
*   The attack complexity is low.
*   The user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires privileged access to the system.
*   The attacker requires local access to the machine where the vulnerable software is running.
*   User interaction is required (UI:R)

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server versions prior to 5.3.0-64 and Prosys OPC UA Modbus Server 1.4.18-5 and prior.
* The CVSS v3 base score is 6.5 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* The advisory includes mitigation steps such as updating to the latest versions and using best practices for network security and remote access.
