```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setDmzCfg` function in `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` passes user-controlled parameters `enable` and `port` to `Uci_set_str` without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with malicious `enable` and `port` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable function."
