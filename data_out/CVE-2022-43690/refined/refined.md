{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-strict comparison when checking legacy password salts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of non-strict comparison (== instead of ===) for legacy password salts.",
     "Potential integer conversion during legacy password comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "Limited authentication bypass is possible.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability when the system compares integer representations of strings to legacy salts.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need specific privileges, but needs to find a user who signed up when the site was concrete5 ~v5.4 and has not logged in since the site was updated above v5.4 and has a password hash that looks like an integer (e.g., '0b1111111')."
