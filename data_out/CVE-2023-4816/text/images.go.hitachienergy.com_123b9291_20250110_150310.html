General Mitigation Factors/Workarounds

Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from
attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physi-
cally protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and
are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed,
and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet
surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be
carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.
