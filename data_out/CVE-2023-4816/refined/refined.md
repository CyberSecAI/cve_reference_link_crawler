- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the Equipment Tag Out functionality when Single Sign-On (SSO) with password validation is enabled in T214.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system allows an authenticated user to perform an Equipment Tag Out holder action (Accept, Release, Clear) for another user by entering an arbitrary password. The system incorrectly processes the arbitrary password and still executes the requested holder action. This bypasses the password validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially cause a safety hazard if the holder action is carried out unintentionally. This could lead to unauthorized changes to equipment status, affecting safety and operation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with the necessary privileges to perform holder actions on behalf of other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Asset Suite system with the security privileges to perform holder actions for other users. The attacker could be a local or remote user.
