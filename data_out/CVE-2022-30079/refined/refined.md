Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-30079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/sbin/acos_service` binary of the Netgear R6200_v2 router.
*   The `ipv6_wan_gateway` variable is passed to a `sprintf` function using `%s` format string, then this is passed to a `system` function, leading to command injection because the attacker controlled value is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core issue is that user-controlled input (`ipv6_wan_gateway`) is used in a `system` call without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The router's web interface allows an authenticated attacker to modify the `ipv6_wan_gateway` parameter. The changed value is directly saved to NVRAM and used in the vulnerable function.
*  **Format String Vulnerability:** Although not directly exploited, the use of `%s` in `sprintf` with user-controlled input is a potential format string vulnerability, which could be further leveraged.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with root privileges. This means they can fully compromise the device.
*   **Complete Device Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to manipulate router settings, redirect network traffic, install backdoors, or use the router as a bot in a botnet.
*   **Potential Network Compromise:** As the router is a central point for network traffic, a compromised router can lead to further compromise of devices connected to the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is reachable via the router's web interface.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers need to send a modified `POST` request to the `/ipv6_fix.cgi` endpoint after visiting the `IPV6_fixed.htm` page.
*   **`ipv6_wan_gateway` Parameter:** The `ipv6_wan_gateway` parameter within the POST data is where the malicious command is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the router's web interface (e.g., with administrator credentials) before they can send the malicious request.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router (i.e., being on the same network or having remote access to the router's management interface).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware that modifying the `ipv6_wan_gateway` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Binary:** `/sbin/acos_service`
*   **Vulnerable Firmware:** Affected firmware versions include all versions for R6200\_v2, including the latest version R6200v2-V1.0.3.12_10.1.11.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `ipv6_wan_gateway`
*   **Vulnerable Webpage:** `http://192.168.1.1/IPV6_fixed.htm`
*   **Vulnerable CGI Endpoint:** `/ipv6_fix.cgi`

**Proof of Concept:**

*   The provided example PoC demonstrates how to send a `POST` request with a malicious payload in `ipv6_wan_gateway` parameter to open a telnet server and get shell access.
