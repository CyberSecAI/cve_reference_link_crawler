Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsafe search paths used by the FortiClient EMS online installer. Specifically, the installer searches for required DLL files in the same directory where the installer executable resides. This behavior is exploitable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The installer's reliance on searching for DLLs in its directory without proper validation creates a DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Unsafe Search Path:** The application searches for DLLs in the same directory, which is controlled by the user, instead of a secure location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place malicious DLL files in the same directory as the installer. When the installer is executed, it will load the malicious DLLs, enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is local. The attacker needs to have control over the directory where the FortiClient EMS online installer resides.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Directory Control:** The attacker needs the ability to write files (specifically malicious DLLs) to the directory where the FortiClient EMS online installer executable is located. This implies some level of access to the target system, although not necessarily administrative.
- **User Interaction**: The user is required to execute the FortiClient EMS online installer.

**Affected Products:**
- FortiClient EMS online installer versions 6.2.9 and below.

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade FortiClient EMS online installer to versions 6.2.9 or above, 6.4.7 or above, or 7.0.1 or above.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-5589 and CVE-2020-9290, which affect other FortiClient products.
- The CVSSv3 score is 8.6 (High), indicating a significant risk.
