Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `wall` utility in `util-linux` does not properly filter escape sequences when processing command-line arguments, unlike its handling of stdin input. This occurs because the `fputs` function is used for argv input, while `fputs_careful` is used for stdin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary text, including control characters, into other users' terminals via `wall`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Neutralization of Escape Sequences:** The `wall` command fails to sanitize or neutralize escape sequences present in command line arguments (`argv`).
- **Inconsistent Input Handling:** The command handles input from stdin differently from input from command line arguments, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Setgid bit:** The `wall` command is setgid tty on some distributions allowing unprivileged users to write to other user's tty.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Text Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the terminals of other users, potentially causing confusion or annoyance.
- **Information Disclosure:** The injected text can potentially be used to leak sensitive information, such as by tricking a user into entering their password as a command.
- **Clipboard Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify the clipboard of the victim through specific escape sequences in terminals that support it (e.g. Windows Terminal).
- **Credential Harvesting:** Attackers can manipulate prompts and command output to harvest user credentials, such as passwords, especially when combined with the leaking of commands not found.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command Line Arguments:** The primary attack vector is through injecting escape sequences into command-line arguments passed to `wall`.
- **"Commands not found" Leaks**:  Some systems attempt to run commands not found and leak those commands as arguments to other programs, this vulnerability can be combined with that feature to expose user inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **`mesg` enabled:** The victim user must have their `mesg` setting enabled (`mesg y`).
- **`wall` setgid:** The `wall` executable must be setgid tty. This is the case on some distributions, like Ubuntu and Debian.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `cdd3cc7fa4` in 2013.
- The vulnerability is present in `util-linux` versions until 2.40.
- CentOS is not vulnerable by default since wall is not setgid.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if the user is accessed via SSH.
- Patches have been released and involve disabling the setgid bit for the `wall` command, and also sanitizing the input or reverting offending commits.
- There is a discussion about the best way to mitigate this issue, including suggestions to restrict allowed characters (C0/C1) and revert commits.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Skyler Ferrante.
- Some systems leak commands not found as command arguments, which can be used in combination with the `wall` command for credential harvesting.
- The vulnerability affects multiple NetApp products, however they are not vulnerable to it, or are still under investigation.
