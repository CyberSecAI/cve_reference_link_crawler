There is only one real solution: do not allow non-root users to write
to foreign file descriptors. Do not install wall(1) with suid. That's

For now, it is enabled by default in the upstream tree, but I will
disable it in the next releases and explicit --enable-* will be
required. We also need to add more information to the man pages.
