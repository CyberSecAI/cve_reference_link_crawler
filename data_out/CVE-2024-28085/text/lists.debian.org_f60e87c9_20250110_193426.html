Package        : util-linux
Version        : 2.33.1-0.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-37600 CVE-2024-28085
Debian Bug     : 826596 991619 1067849

CVE-2024-28085

    Skyler Ferrante discovered that the wall(1) utility found in
    util-linux, a collection of system utilities for Linux, does not
    filter escape sequences from command line arguments.  This allows
    unprivileged local users to put arbitrary text on other users
    terminals if mesg is set to â€˜yâ€™ and the wall executable is setgid,
    which could lead to information disclosure.

    With this update the wall executable is no longer installed setgid
    tty.

CVE-2021-37600

    Kihong Heo found an integer overflow which can potentially lead to
    buffer overflow if an attacker were able to use system resources in
    a way that leads to a large number in the /proc/sysvipc/sem file.
    NOTE: this is issue is unexploitable in GNU C Library environments,
    and possibly in all realistic environments.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.33.1-0.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.
