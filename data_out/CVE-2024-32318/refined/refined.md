- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow in the `fromSetVlanInfo` function of Tenda AC500 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `vlan` parameter from a POST request is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack using `strcpy`, without checking its size, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/goform/forSetVlanInfo` with a `vlan` parameter larger than 256 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
