Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-47209:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2022-47209 - Hardcoded Credentials / Backdoor Account

*   **Root Cause:** The presence of a hardcoded "support" user account with a default password ("support") that cannot be changed through normal means. This account appears to be intended as a backdoor for Technical Support staff.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Hardcoded credentials for the "support" account.
    *   The inability to change the default password for the "support" account via normal user interfaces.
    *   The existence of a backdoor account with a known password.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the "support" account can potentially gain unauthorized access to the device. While this account may not have access to standard interfaces like the web UI, it still provides a foothold for malicious activities and further exploitation. The impact is rated as having Low Confidentiality, Low Integrity, and Low Availability impact according to the provided CVSS score.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network access, as the content states that the patch "appears to prevent access to this account from all currently known vectors". However, the specific vector is not mentioned within this document.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the device via the network using the hardcoded credentials for the support account. This indicates that a low skilled attacker could use these credentials to access the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document specifies that the "support" account does not have access to the web UI or other standard interfaces.
*   The provided patch aims to prevent access to this account from "all currently known vectors".
*   The document mentions the other vulnerabilities CVE-2022-47208 (Command Injection in User Agent) and CVE-2022-47210 (Command Injection in Restricted Shell) that are found in the same devices.
*   The document also indicates that the patch for this vulnerability needs to be applied manually since the auto-update mechanism on the device does not detect it.
