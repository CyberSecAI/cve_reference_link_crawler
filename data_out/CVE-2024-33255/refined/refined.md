Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the issue is an assertion failure in `ecma_free_string_list` within the JerryScript engine. Specifically, the assertion `ECMA_STRING_IS_REF_EQUALS_TO_ONE (string_p)` fails, indicating an issue with the reference counting or management of strings during the garbage collection or cleanup process. The issue appears to be triggered by incomplete class definitions remaining in the heap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The issue is labeled as a memory leak, implying that certain memory allocated for strings is not being freed properly, potentially due to incorrect reference counts. The incomplete class definitions remaining in the heap suggest a failure in cleanup.
- **Assertion Failure:** The failing assertion `ECMA_STRING_IS_REF_EQUALS_TO_ONE` highlights a flaw in the internal logic of the string management within the engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Program Termination:** The primary impact is a crash of the JerryScript engine due to the assertion failure, leading to program termination.
- **Potential Memory Exhaustion:** If the memory leak is triggered repeatedly, it could potentially lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JavaScript Code:** The vulnerability can be triggered by specially crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the provided test cases (`poc1.js` and `poc2.js`). These scripts involve complex object and class definitions that expose the underlying issue in the engine's string management.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the JerryScript environment. This means that either the attacker needs to be in a position to run their own scripts or is able to inject them into a vulnerable application.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided content contains specific test cases, details about the affected code location (`ecma-literal-storage.c`), and a more clear description of the root cause (incomplete class definitions), all of which are not usually present in a standard CVE description.

**In summary:** The issue is a memory leak vulnerability caused by improper string management within the JerryScript engine, leading to an assertion failure and engine crash when processing specific JavaScript code.
