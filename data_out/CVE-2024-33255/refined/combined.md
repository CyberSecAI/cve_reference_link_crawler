| So far, the preliminary conclusion in the comments section is that this is a memory leak? I think the last issue with a similar error is January 2021. Does the community have a corresponding plan to fix this problem? Or what are the current conclusions about this issue, such as the impact is relatively small? |

| [@akosthekiss](https://github.com/akosthekiss) Our project uses Jerry as the JS engine. The issue released on the official platform can help us check whether some problems are introduced by ourselves. Memory leakage is a serious problem. So, I'd like to know how jerry's official attitude to this issue is. The triggering conditions provided by developers seem to be triggered by incorrect JS cases. Whether this problem does not affect the normal use of Jerry can be avoided by verifying the code. |

| does [#4525](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/4525) related to this?  Sorry for the late response. Yes, probably [#4525](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/4525) is the minimized testcase for this fuzzer testcase. It looks like incomplete class definitions remains in the heap unfortunately. |
