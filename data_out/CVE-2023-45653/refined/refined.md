- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited through CSRF, where an attacker tricks a user into unknowingly executing actions on the vulnerable website while they are logged in.
