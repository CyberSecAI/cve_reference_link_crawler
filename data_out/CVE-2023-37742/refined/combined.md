## WebBoss.io Update: Multiple Shipping Options

One of the most recently requested features for our eCommerce module was that of multiple and more flexible shipping options.

We are pleased to announce that as of version 3.6.6 of the WebBoss system, you can now create multiple and flexible shipping options to cater for all your needs!
# **How does it work?**

The basic idea of the new shipping options is that you can create multiple different shipping options, all with different configurations, including restrictions.

When the user goes through the checkout process, the website will check all the available shipping options you have configured (based off of the shipping address, cart products etc.) and show buttons in the checkout to select which option to use, or if only one is available it will select that one automatically.

# **Stay COVID-19 safe with Click & Collect**

One of the main new features is to allow collection, or “Click & Collect”, and to be able to create locations for this.

If you have a shipping option with the type set to “collection”, then the checkout process will allow to you choose between delivery and collection. When the user chooses collection, instead of entering a shipping address, they will choose a collection location, which can also be displayed on a map.

To configure your shipping options in your website admin, from the sidebar navigation, go to Modules > eCommerce > Shop Settings > Postage Settings.

The “Default” tab holds some general postage settings, and the basic settings to use if you’re not yet ready to use the new shipping options.

The main tab to use here is the “Postage Types” tab. Here you can create new options and click the “Configure” button to change the settings like the restrictions and free conditions.

If you’re using the collection option, you will need to create locations for customers to collect from, which can be done under the “Locations” tab.

The last tab is “Price Charts”, which can be used to create a table used to calculate shipping price based on weight, which can then be applied to shipping options.

# **Configuration Examples**

# Standard and Next Day delivery

If you want users to have the option to choose between various delivery types, create two different shipping options; for this example we will use “Standard” and “Next Day” delivery.

For the Standard delivery, don’t add any restrictions so this will always be displayed as the default option.

When configuring the Next Day delivery however, you may decide to add restrictions to it so for example you could set it so next day delivery is only available on orders over a set amount. Alternatively, you could also set this option to be free if the order is over a set amount.

Then when a customer goes through your checkout, this is what they will see when they get to the point of confirming their order:

# Local, National and International Delivery

If you want to have different prices for local and international delivery, you could create a different shipping option for each area.

Your first option could be your local delivery, so for this option you could restrict it to specific postcodes, and then you could have another option for national delivery by restricting it to only the UK for example.

Depending on how you want to handle overseas shipping, you could create an option for Europe and an option for International, but excluding UK.

Alternatively, you could even have different options for different countries if you wanted to be more specific.

# Different Couriers

If you wanted to deliver through multiple different couriers, you could create a shipping option for each one, each with their own restrictions and prices.

You can set up a price chart for each courier so you can configure the price based on weight ranges and apply each price chart to a shipping option.

You could also restrict each courier to specific shop categories, so if you have different products dispatched by different couriers, it will automatically select the correct courier.

# **How will you use it?**

As you can see, the new shipping options are very flexible and allow for various ways in which you can charge for postage, or restrict items based on weight, price, location or country!

How do you get these features on your website?
If you are a customer of WebBoss, then you will automatically get these new features added to your eCommerce module (for free!) when you update your system in the admin dashboard.

## Version 3.6.5 - 17th Dec 2020

The platform has recently launched a new update, **version 3.6.5**, which contains a few new features that will be sure to increase the performance of our client’s websites.

# **What is New?**

* SEO Tools – LazyLoad Integration
* Google Analytics Trigger
* Shop Catalogue Mode
* CSV Options
* Header Images
* Business Information

# **SEO Tools – LazyLoad**

LazyLoad is now something featured within the WebBoss CMS. LazyLoad is a way to optimise a website and decrease page speeds. The way in which this works, is by not allowing the whole page to load all at the same time, this includes images and content. It will mean that when the user accesses the webpage it will only load what the user sees, meaning that the page loads quicker because there won’t be as much to load all at once. This can be hugely beneficial to websites that contain a lot of large images that take quite a long time to load. This is also very beneficial for user experience, as it means less time for the pages to load and therefore reduces frustration and waiting times.

Although this seems like a very beneficial feature for SEO, our development team decided that our clients could have the option to enable this on their website, rather than including it as a standard feature within the CMS. This is due to the fact that clients may not want this feature enabled as it can delay the loading times of some images. This can also depend on the design of the website, as some images may need to display straightaway to the user.

In order for you to enable this on your WebBoss Website, simply go to your side bar and then choose 'SEO Settings' then choose 'SEO: Image Optimisation'. From here, you will be able to enable LazyLoad on your website by ticking the box, and that's it, your website speed will definitely improve using this feature.

# **Google Analytics Trigger**

A new Google Analytics trigger has been added to send information to Google Analytics regarding web forms. For this to work, you have to make sure that your website has been set up with Google Analytics beforehand and then the system will automatically start to send information to Google Analytics. This is already a feature within our eCommerce module, where it will send information about your cart and products over to Google Analytics, making it very easy to track how your clients are using your checkout process. This has now been added to our Web Forms module, meaning that if you include a contact form on your website, you will be able to track how many people have submitted the form over on Google Analytics. This can be hugely beneficial for your marketing efforts and conversions.

# **CSV Options**

We have now added basic and advanced CSV templates within our eCommerce module. This will make uploading mass shop products a lot simpler. You will now have the option to download our basic shop CSV, which contains simplified essential columns for basic product upload. If you have more advanced shop products, then our advanced CSV template will be the best option to use.

To access the CSV import section on your website, simply go to your **'eCommerce Module'** and choose **'Import & Export Products or Categories'**. From here you will be able to easily download the CSV by clicking on the one that is suitable.

# **Shop Catalogue Mode**

Our shop catalogue mode is a very useful tool in our eCommerce module, that allows you to showcase your products on your website, without your users being able to purchase online and so your product list becomes a catalogue. This is ideal for showroom websites, to give the users a real feel for what you sell and also encourage them to visit your shop/ showroom. We have since updated this feature to allow individual categories to become set to catalogue mode, meaning that you can sell your products online and also choose a category as just a catalogue for your users.

**There are a few ways you can use this feature:**

1. To set your whole website as catalogue mode. To do this, go to your **‘eCommerce Module’** then select **‘Shop Settings’** from here you can click on the tab **‘Display Settings’** or alternatively choose **‘Display Settings’** in the side bar. The top setting is **'Display Shop as Catalogue';** from here you can set your shop to show the prices or to hide the prices. Once this has been saved, your whole online shop will be viewed as a catalogue and your products will not be able to be purchased online.
2. Alternatively if you prefer the majority of your website to be an online shop, you can add just one of your categories as a catalogue. To enable this, go to **‘eCommerce Module’** then **‘Manage Shop Categories’** from here you can either choose an existing category or create a new one and use the setting 'Catalogue Mode' to make that category a catalogue.

# **Header Images**

We have added a new feature to the page editor, to allow you to set a header image of your choice that will override the header image chosen in the theme designer. When a website is designed, there is usually a header image that features on most of your pages and this is usually added in the theme designer. You can now change this in the page editor, so that you can choose a different header image on each of your pages.

To do this, go to **'Edit Pages'** and choose the page you would like to add a new header image too. You will then see the new **'Header Image'** section where you can select a new image to feature as the header image. Don't forget to upload your image first in the 'File Upload' section.

# **Business Information**

We have added extra options to our all new Business Information section that featured in our last update. This part of the system creates that very important Structured data that Google uses to feature information in their search results. This section now features an area for you to write a bio for any people that have been added, this could be team members, owners, etc. There are also new features added to the **‘Business Type’** section. If you are a food establishment, you can now have the option of adding which cuisine you specialise in and also add your menu URL and booking URL. This will provide Google with detailed information that they can feature within the search results, making it even easier for your users to understand your business and see your menu or book a table.

# **Full Changelog:**

# **Added**

* Added option to set header background image on page editor

## Version 3.6.4 - 07th Nov 2020

# **Our New Business Information Feature Can Help Improve Your Search Engine Results**

This update gives you a new feature in your admin dashboard to set up all your business information in a nice, organised way. This is then fed into your website in such a way for Google and other search engines to read to make you appear in search results much better than before, giving your site a small SEO boost!

You may have noticed that when you type in a company name or specific search term into Google, a variety of different search results will appear. A few years back, when you searched for a company or something similar, you only had the choice from a list of webpages that would appeared on the Google search results page. Back then it was incredibly important that your website appeared at the top of the first page, or that was the goal at least. However, now we are provided with a lot of different search options when we conduct a Google search. One of which is a rich result, which goes beyond just bringing up a webpage link on the search results page. This information is far more useful for the user and often includes images, telephone numbers, locations etc. When you are searching for something specific, often the information that you are looking for will be displayed in one of these rich results, making it far easier to find what you are looking for.  You may have also noticed that when you search for a specific company, on the right-hand side of the search results is a box of information, this is called a ‘knowledge panel’. This type of rich result can be hugely beneficial to the user, as they can easily find exactly what they are looking for.

# **Is a Knowledge Panel Important for SEO?**

Absolutely! A knowledge panel can be hugely important for your visibility on a search results page. If your target audience is searching specifically for your brand name, then you will pretty much dominate the top of the search results page on both mobile and desktop searches, with easy to find information like your phone number, where your business is located and your opening hours. This type of information is going to be very beneficial to you, as your business will be able to stand out from others and make you easy to find. This can help with your SEO, as you are more likely to gain clicks through to your website from your Knowledge panel.

# **How Does Google Find this Information?**

Google bots love structured data when they crawl a website, this information highlights exactly what the webpage is about, and makes it easier for the search engine to identify relevant data for different search terms. This data is what Google will pull from a website and show in their rich results. The way in which the code is structured, means that each element must be filled out to describe what is on that webpage, for example, a recipe may have a name/title, author, ingredients list, cooking method, etc. All of this information will be pulled by a search engine to feature in the rich results as a rich snippet, again meaning that you as a user can gain all of the information that you require by doing a single search. However, filling this information out on a regular webpage can be a struggle not only for you as the user, but also for the search engine to find all the information that it needs.

# **Our New Feature**

We have created a ‘Business Information’ feature within our CMS, that will allow our clients to fill out the important information that they want the search engine to see, such as opening times and amenities. Our developers have designed this feature to mimic the structured data that Google and other search engines will be looking for on your website, which will fulfil the rich results shown on the search results page. This will make the information provided far more likely to be visible in the rich results on Google and also within the Knowledge panels. This section of the CMS is also extremely easy to use, and will only take a few minutes for you to fill out all of the necessary information.

As we pride ourselves on providing universal system updates to our clients, this brand new feature is not a plugin, it has been built directly into the WebBoss CMS system and will be available to all of our clients as standard. Making improving your SEO available to all, without any technical know-how, stress-free and at no extra cost! Not a WebBoss client yet? No problem!

# What Has Been Added?

WebBoss comes with a fully functioning online shop with a contact form, the ability to order online (perfect for table service, collection or delivery!), a newsletter creator, SSL, and is fully Gift Aid compliant! If that's not enough, then the built in GDPR module will help to simplify the collection, storing and deletion of personal data in line with both GDPR and NHS Track and Trace guidelines. As you may have heard, restaurants and pubs are required to collect and store customer data for a period of time for Track and Trace safety measures.

As this is a necessary step in the fight against COVID-19, we have added some features to our Content Management System (CMS) that may aid pubs, restaurants and many other businesses during this time.

# Track and Trace

This is undoubtedly one of the most daunting elements for a lot of businesses, with many of them asking the question, 'How are we going to obtain and store data for NHS Track and Trace?' With this in mind, we have added a ‘Track and Trace’ page to our platform, this page has been designed to only show the relevant customer data that will be required for contacting customers in the event that a person has tested positive for Coronavirus after visiting your premises. This information will then be pulled from the eCommerce orders page on your website, and only the relevant data will be displayed.

You will also be able to filter this information by date, so finding the contact information that you will need will be quick and effortless. On top of this, the system will also only choose the orders that were made through the 'restaurant' section on your website, meaning that there will be no confusion as to who had ordered food inside your establishment; as delivery and collection will not be relevant for Track and Trace. You will also have the option of being able to download all of this information as a CSV, making managing this data an absolute doddle.

# Table Orders

Your website will offer your customers the opportunity to choose either ‘Delivery’, ‘Collection’ or ‘Restaurant’. The ‘Restaurant’ feature will enable your customers to order food and drinks from their table. This is a simple 4 step process:

1. They choose what they would like to eat from your online menu and click checkout.
2. Then they click to select the ‘Restaurant’ option in the checkout.
3. Next they add their table number.
4. Finally they pay online and the order is sent straight to you.

Not only is this hugely important for the social distancing rules that are currently in place, but it will also massively reduce the amount of contact made between your staff members and your customers, ensuring that you are all as protected as possible.

# Printed Orders

Our system allows you to print orders automatically (this will depend on which email client that you are using). The system can send orders to a specified email address, which you can set up to print in your restaurant, pub etc. So there is no need to keep checking your website for new orders, as these will printed and ready to pass on to the relevant staff members. We hope that this will be a huge help as restaurants become a lot busier, as you will be able to easily manage the orders made through your website.

We really want to ensure that small businesses within the hospitality industry are fully prepared and are as equipped as they can be for when they decide to re-open. We understand that this is going to be quite a stressful time for businesses, so we hope that offering these features will help the industry get back on it's feet. Contact us for more information.

## New GDPR Module

As you may or may not know, new General Data Protection Regulations are being implemented as of 25th May. This will mean that businesses will have to comply with new regulations and if they fail to do so then there are serious penalties in place. WebBoss have created a new, easy to use module to ensure that your website complies with the new GDPR rules.

# Double opt-in for newsletters

When your users sign up for a newsletter, they will receive a confirmation email before they are added to your mailing list.

# Data requests

New form where users can request a copy of the personal data you hold for hem or they can request their data to be removed in the admin. You can review these requests and action them with a single click.

# Cookie policy generator

Generates the cookie policy for you.

# Privacy policy generator

Provides resource links to receive templates and allows you to edit within the text editor.

# Terms & conditions generator

Similar to the privacy policy generator, this provides resource links to receive templates and allows you to edit within the text editor.

# For more information on GDPR

What the new regulations mean in 1 minute: [[infographic](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/EU-GDPR-new.jpg)].
