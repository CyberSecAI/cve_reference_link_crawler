- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Access Control
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication when interacting with the MQTT broker, allowing unauthorized access to send and receive messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send and receive messages, including GET/SET configuration commands, reboot commands, and firmware updates, leading to full device compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be aware of the MQTT topic names, and does not need to be authenticated.
