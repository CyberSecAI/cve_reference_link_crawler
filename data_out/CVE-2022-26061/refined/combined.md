# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1487

## HDF5 Group libhdf5 gif2h5 heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### August 16, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-26061

##### SUMMARY

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the gif2h5 functionality of HDF5 Group libhdf5 1.10.4. A specially-crafted GIF file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

HDF5 Group libhdf5 1.10.4

##### PRODUCT URLS

libhdf5 - <https://www.hdfgroup.org>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

HDF5 is a file format that is maintained by a non-profit organization, the HDF Group. HDF5 is designed to store and organize large amounts of scientific data. It is used to exchange data structures between applications in industries (such as the GIS industry) via libraries such as GDAL, OGR or as part of software like ArcGIS.

Their included gif2h5 tool is used for converting GIF data to the HDF5 file format.

The vulnerability exists in their gif2h5 tool/library, specifically in ReadGifHeader() function while attempting to convert GIF files to their HDF5 format. The vulnerability exists due to a failure to check the size of an allocated heap buffer while writing and parsing GIF image data stream.

When attempting to parse the GIF local image descriptor, a buffer is allocated based on the width and height of the image to store the image data stream. We can see this occur in `gifread.c` under the `ReadGifImageDesc()` function:

```
186     if (!(GifImageDesc->GIFImage =
187               (GIFBYTE *)malloc((GifImageDesc->ImageWidth) * (GifImageDesc->ImageHeight)))) {  // Malloc here
188         printf("Out of memory");
189         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
190     }

```

In this case we are using an image that is 5x5, so `malloc(0x19)` is called which returns a chunk of usable size, `0x28 (40)`. Following this, the data stream is read and written to the GifImageDesc->GIFImage member without any bounds checking. It instead relies on valid block size values, allowing an attacker to arbitrarily write data beyond the bounds of the heap buffer. This can lead to code execution.

```
192	     TempPtr = GifImageDesc->GIFImage;
/*
       Here we can see our allocated buffer at 0x555555a840a0:
       gef➤  hexdump TempPtr
       0x0000555555a840a0     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................
       0x0000555555a840b0     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................
       0x0000555555a840c0     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 41 ff 01 00 00 00 00 00    ........A.......
       0x0000555555a840d0     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    ................
 */
193	     do {
194	         ch = ch1 = (int)*(*MemGif2)++;
195	         while (ch--)
196	             *TempPtr++ = *(*MemGif2)++;
197	     } while (ch1);
198
199	     return (0); /* No FILE stream error occured */

```

Here, we can see that we have written data well beyond the bounds of the heap buffer.

```
