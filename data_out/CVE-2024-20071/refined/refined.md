- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the WLAN driver
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker with system privileges could read sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a malicious actor to already have System privileges. No user interaction is required for the exploit to work once the attacker has the necessary privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have already obtained System privileges on the target device.
