- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Classified Listing Plugin versions 2.4.5 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in user interacts with it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
