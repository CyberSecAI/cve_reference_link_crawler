Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6122

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Incorrect default permissions assigned to the installation directory of the shared NI SystemLink Server KeyValueDatabase service. This service uses Redis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from overly permissive default permissions on the KeyValueDatabase directory, allowing local users to potentially access sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability results in information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A local user with access to the system can exploit the incorrect permissions to potentially gain unauthorized access to data stored by the service

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to have access to the system where the affected software is installed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker would likely access the file system directly to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to access the file system of the machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **No special privileges** beyond basic local user access appear to be required.

**Affected Products:**
*   NI SystemLink Server 2024 Q1 and prior versions.
*   NI FlexLogger 2023 Q2 and prior versions (when the shared service is installed).

**Mitigation:**
*   **Upgrade:**  NI strongly recommends upgrading to SystemLink Server 2024 Q1 Patch 2 or later or FlexLogger 2023 Q3 or later, where the dependency has been removed.
*   **Manual Permission Changes:** If upgrading is not immediately feasible, manual mitigation steps are provided, involving adjusting the permissions of the `KeyValueDatabase` directory under `ProgramData\National Instruments\Skyline\` to remove access for `Users` and `Authenticated Users`, and then rebooting.

**CVSS Score:**
*   5.5 - CVSS:3.1 AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions)
*   NI acknowledges Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for reporting this vulnerability.
