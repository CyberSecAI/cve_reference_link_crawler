1. [util/user: keep reference to user in each usage table](/bus1/dbus-broker/commit/608b259e25ef1348b9e4a8e022c35b5c68d3df98)
    …

   ```
   Keep a reference to an owning user in each usage table. We want to allow
   callers to hold charges without holding on to any user references.

   Also fix the peer-deinitialization to be ordered correctly and free the
   user references last (in particular, after the charges). This is not
   strictly necessary, but now follows our coding style and would have
   avoided possible failures.

   This fixes an assertion failure when disconnecting entire groups of
   peers of the same user, due to the recent fix that actually made
   peer-accounting do something.

1. [launch/service: fix release of argv array](/bus1/dbus-broker/commit/6d9b817b7c165be9addbc28b9e84d7ed1697d11a)
    …

   ```
   While service_free() correctly releases the strv in `argv`, the
   service_update() path does not. It frees `argv`, but not the individual
   entries. Fix this and properly release all entries.

2. [global: use c\_mem\*() over mem\*()](/bus1/dbus-broker/commit/701759a08f5982f515308c269a8e224fc433f4af)
    …

   ```
   Use the new c_mem*() functions rather than mem*() so we protect against
   NULL pointers in empty areas, which are UB with the classic mem*()
   functions.
