### @roxspring **[roxspring](/roxspring)** commented [May 28, 2020](#issue-626889766)

* Escape arguments containing `#`, with unit test
  + Closes [MSHARED-431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHARED-431)
* Partial port of [sonatype/plexus-utils@b38a1b3](https://github.com/sonatype/plexus-utils/commit/b38a1b3a4352303e4312b2bb601a0d7ec6e28f41)
  + BourneShell unconditionally single quotes the executable and arguments
  + ~~Shell usage is only desirable when generating code for remote execution~~ omitted because shell usage is also required for running built-in commands such as `echo` as used in the tests.
  + Closes [MSHARED-297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHARED-297)
