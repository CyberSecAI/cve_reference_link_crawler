Version        : 3.3.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-29599
Debian Bug     : 1012314

It was discovered that the Commandline class in maven-shared-utils, a
collection of various utility classes for the Maven build system, can emit
double-quoted strings without proper escaping, allowing shell injection
attacks.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
3.3.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your maven-shared-utils packages.

For the detailed security status of maven-shared-utils please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/maven-shared-utils>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

#### Description

The Commandline class can emit double-quoted strings without proper escaping, allowing shell injection attacks.

The BourneShell class should unconditionally single-quote emitted strings (including the name of the command itself being quoted), with '"'"' used for embedded single quotes, for maximum safety across shells implementing a superset of POSIX quoting rules.

An appropriate fix has been built and applied against PLXUTILS; that patch is submitted here in the hope that it will be useful, though it is not expected to apply to the maven-shared-utils codebase without modification.

See PLXUTILS-161 for history/discussion.
