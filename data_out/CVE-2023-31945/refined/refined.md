- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `daily_expenditure_edit.php` file of the Online Travel Agency System.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker is shown to be able to extract database information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` GET parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable URL. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability on the `daily_expenditure_edit.php` page.
