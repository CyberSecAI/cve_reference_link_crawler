The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28089.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Device Location" page of the Hitron CODA-4582 router's admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DOM-based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The input field in the "Device Location" page does not sanitize malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The injected script can cause a DoS condition.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker within Wi-Fi proximity with access to the router's admin panel can inject malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi proximity of the vulnerable router.
- The attacker needs valid credentials to access the router's admin panel.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious scripts into the "Device Location" input field.
