Create **Unlimited Folders** In The Free Version üéâ

Folders is a WordPress plugin that enables users to organize all of their Pages, Posts, and Media files in folders. Easily drag and drop items into directories and change the folders tree view (hierarchy). Check out [**Folders Pro Plans**](https://premio.io/downloads/folders "Folders pro plans").

#### üí™ How Folders Plugin Can Help You

Use Folders plugin to organize your WordPress content:

* Keep all of your media files organized in folders including photos, videos, music, main website pages, and blog posts. You can also organize media library files in multiple folders.
* Web developers: keep your clients‚Äô website pages in proper order. Mark a folder with a star or give it a unique name for clients to understand what is important.

My favorite plugin to organize media and more into folders, also for several websites of my clients. While most important essential options are free (which ist great and different from several other plugins), PRO is still a good option to get all your assets organized even better.Support once needed the team was very friendly and fast and engaged and successfully in solving the issue (not caused by them). Lightweight and easy to handle. Also no problems at deactivation or migrations found.Absolutely recommended.

If you plan on having A LOT OF FOLDERS to accommodate A LOT of photos and A LOT of variants for your products‚Ä¶. I would not recommend this plugin. The default sort is by ‚Äúcreation date.‚Äù AND YOU CANNOT set the default sort to anything else. I contacted support and they said there is no option to set the default sort to anything else in this time. They can write the code to sort lists‚Ä¶ and they give you the option to set how those lists are sorted‚Ä¶. but they can‚Äôt give you a way to set the default sort?!?!? I‚Äôm EXTREMELY disappointed to find out a PAID PLUGIN can‚Äôt give you this very basic option. I can‚Äôt believe it.

I really like Folders, and have now been using it for many years. Excellent service support as well as an easy-to-use, friendly and good-looking interface. Bit shocked to start with by the default pink, but have come to quite like it, and am not shifting to a less in-your-face colour. Thanks to the team.
