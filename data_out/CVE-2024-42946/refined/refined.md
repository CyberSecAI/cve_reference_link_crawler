{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `fromVirtualSer` function of the Tenda FH1201 firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `fromVirtualSer` function uses `sprintf` to construct a string using the user-supplied `page` parameter from a POST request without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the statement `sprintf(v5, \"nat_virtualser.asp?page=%s\", v3);` is vulnerable because user-controlled input `v3` is inserted into a fixed-size buffer `v5`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation leads to a stack buffer overflow that can result in arbitrary code execution on the device. This could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the device, potentially enabling them to conduct further malicious activities such as data theft, eavesdropping, or establishing a foothold within the network.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through a POST request to the `/goform/VirtualSer` endpoint. The attacker controls the `page` parameter in the POST data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable device. This implies that the attacker should either be on the same network or be able to route requests to the network that the device is on. No authentication is mentioned in the exploit details."
