Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `/admin/article/article-add-run.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter, which is part of an INSERT SQL query, is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) in the `/admin/article/article-add-run.php` file. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (as demonstrated in the provided examples) or other confidential information.
- **Integrity:** An attacker can modify data stored in the database, potentially corrupting the application data or inserting malicious content.
- **Availability:** An attacker could potentially use the SQL injection vulnerability to disrupt the availability of the application by performing actions such as dropping tables, modifying data required for application functionality, or causing database errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `/admin/article/article-add-run.php`, with a crafted payload injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** The vulnerability exists in the admin panel. Depending on access controls to this admin panel, the attacker may need to have valid admin credentials or be able to bypass authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is within the `/admin/article/article-add-run.php` file, where the following unsanitized SQL query is constructed using user-provided input:
    ```php
    $str='INSERT INTO `rapidcmspage`(`id`, `title`, `content`, `time`, `categoryid`) VALUES ("'.$_POST["id"].'","'.rawurlencode($_POST["title"]).'","'.$cont2.'","'.$timenow.'","'.$_POST["categoryid"].'")';
    ```
- **Exploit Example:** The provided example shows how the `id` parameter can be crafted to inject SQL code, such as `1111111116",(select password from rapidcmsadmin),"%3Cp%3Ewadawd%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fp%3E","2023-9-17","1") -- adawd`. This injected SQL code is then executed by the database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The injected SQL code results are reflected in the application's title field, allowing the attacker to retrieve data such as database version, database name, table names, column names and even sensitive data like admin passwords.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the "Add Article" functionality of the admin panel.
- The `id` field is a non-repeatable primary key, which means the attacker needs to generate new `id` values for each injection attempt.
- The vulnerability is present in RapidCMS Dev.1.3.1
- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform complete database information disclosure
