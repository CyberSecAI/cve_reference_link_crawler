Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct use of the `$id` parameter from the URL in an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into a database query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `result.php` is used in the SQL query without sanitization: `SELECT * FROM exam_tbl WHERE ex_id='$examId'`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter to:
  - Retrieve sensitive information from the database.
  - Potentially modify or delete data.
  - Possibly gain control of the database server.
- The provided SQLmap command suggests the attacker can retrieve information like the current database user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/home.php` page, specifically targeting the `result` page with a manipulated `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific user role or authentication is needed, as the vulnerability is present in the `result.php` page which is accessed through the `home.php` page.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content gives a very clear breakdown of the vulnerability, providing a Proof of Concept (PoC) including a Burp request and an SQLmap command.
- The github document provides the vulnerable code snippet for `result.php`, demonstrating the lack of sanitization.
- The `vuldb.com` submission provides a good summary of the vulnerability with a link to the github PoC.
