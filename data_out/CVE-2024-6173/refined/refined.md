- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Guard Tour VAPIX API parameter allows the use of arbitrary values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a parameter in the Guard Tour VAPIX API, which can lead to denial of service. Specifically, this can cause a block access to the guard tour configuration page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can block access to the guard tour configuration page in the web interface of the Axis device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the Guard Tour VAPIX API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account to exploit the vulnerability.
