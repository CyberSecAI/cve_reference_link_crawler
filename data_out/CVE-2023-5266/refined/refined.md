Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in `/src/admin/tags_main.php` of DedeBIZ V6.2.
- The code constructs a SQL query using unsanitized input from the `ids` parameter.
- Specifically, the `$query = "DELETE FROM `#@__tagindex` WHERE id IN ($stringids)";` is vulnerable, where `$stringids` is directly derived from the user-controlled `$ids` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious SQL code via the `ids` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the input before using it in the SQL query.
- **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker can't directly see the results of the SQL query, they can use time delays (e.g., `sleep()`) to infer information about the database (e.g., length of database name) by observing the server response time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Integrity:** An attacker can potentially modify data in the database.
- **Availability:** An attacker might be able to disrupt the normal operation of the application or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/src/admin/tags_main.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `ids` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send HTTP GET requests to the target server.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- **Authentication to admin panel:** The attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel to reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided github issue #1 contains a detailed explanation and proof-of-concept exploit that uses time-based blind SQL injection to extract the database name.
- The exploit requires the presence of data in the `#@__tagindex` table which can be created by adding articles to the site.
- A python script is provided in a zip file to demonstrate automated exploitation. The script uses time delays to identify the length of the database name and then extracts the name character-by-character.
