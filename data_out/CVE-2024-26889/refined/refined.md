      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The `strcpy` function was used to copy the Bluetooth device name (`hdev->name`) into a fixed-size buffer (`di.name`), which is a field in the `hci_dev_info` struct. If `hdev->name` exceeds the size of `di.name` (8 bytes), it leads to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow due to use of strcpy with a fixed-size buffer and an unbounded input."
      ],
        "Impact": "A buffer overflow could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite critical data or execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack Vector": "An attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by providing a Bluetooth device name longer than 8 bytes, which is then copied into the `di.name` buffer during the execution of `hci_get_dev_info()`",
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to be able to influence the Bluetooth device name (hdev->name) reported by the system which would likely require some level of access to the bluetooth subsystem. The `hci_get_dev_info` function is likely to be used by a privileged user-space tool."
    },
    "Fix Information": {
      "Fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `strcpy` with `strscpy`, which prevents buffer overflows by truncating the source string to fit the destination buffer's size.",
