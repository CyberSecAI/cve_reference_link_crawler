- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is present in versions <= 2.0.8.8 of the "The Pack Elementor addons" WordPress plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can lead to the execution of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads when a user visits the affected website. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website. This could potentially be through vulnerable input fields or other mechanisms within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable area of the plugin, which would then be executed on a user's browser. The specific injection point and mechanism is not detailed in the provided content. The attacker would need to have the "Author" privilege in WordPress to exploit the vulnerability.
