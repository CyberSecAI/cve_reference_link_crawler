The provided content is related to CVE-2024-46722.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `amdgpu_atombios_init_mc_reg_table` function within the AMDGPU driver. Specifically, when processing memory controller (MC) register tables, the code attempts to access `mc_data[i-1]` without checking if `i` is 0, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to read an element from the `mc_data` array using an index `i-1`, which results in reading before the start of the array, when i is 0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to a crash, denial-of-service, or information disclosure. This is because reading outside of the allocated memory can return unpredictable or sensitive data or cause an exception that terminates the process or system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when initializing the memory controller register table via the `amdgpu_atombios_init_mc_reg_table` function. This is a function that is called during driver initialization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to control or manipulate the MC register table data that the AMDGPU driver loads during initialization.

The provided patches adds a check `if (i == 0) continue;` to prevent reading `mc_data[i-1]` when i is 0.
