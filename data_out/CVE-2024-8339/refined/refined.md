Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the "Electric Billing Management System 1.0". Specifically, user-supplied data, such as the `code` parameter in `tracks.php`, is directly used in SQL queries without any filtering or escaping of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.
*   This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, modification or deletion of data, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `code` parameter in the `tracks.php` file.
*   Specifically, the `code` parameter within the URL `/?page=tracks&code=` is the attack vector

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No specific authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft the SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is `tracks.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `code`.
*   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
*   The provided payload is:
    `GET /electric_billing_0/electric_billing/?page=tracks&code=-1%27%20union%20select%201%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C14%2Csqlite_version()%3B HTTP/1.1`
*   The vulnerability is present in "Sourcecodester Electric Billing Management System 1.0" by oretnom23.
*   The provided screenshots confirm the successful SQL injection.
