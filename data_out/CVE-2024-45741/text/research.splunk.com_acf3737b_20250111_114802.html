# Detection: Splunk Persistent XSS via Props Conf

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: d7b5aa71-157f-4359-9c34-e35752b1d0a2
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.3 and 9.1.6 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.2.2403.108 and 9.1.2312.205, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through entity.details in props.conf that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_ui` status=201 uri_path="*/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/*/configs/*"
2
3| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by host clientip user uri status
4
5| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
6
7| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`

9| `splunk_persistent_xss_via_props_conf_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_persistent\_xss\_via\_props\_conf\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_persistent_xss_via_props_conf_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal index and web component enabled.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search that provides information on the creation of a scheduled view against the targeted endpoint("*/splunkd/\_\_raw/servicesNS/user/search/configs/*"). In the attack flow the payload is saved via scheduled view then sent to the victim.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential XSS attack against $host$ | 1 | 10 | 10 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
