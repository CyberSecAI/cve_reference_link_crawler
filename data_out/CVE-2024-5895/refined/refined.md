Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `id` parameter within the `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php?f=delete` file being directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php?f=delete`.
- **`id` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `id`, which is sent within the POST request body using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Target:** Basic understanding of how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests and manipulate request parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable file is `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php` with the `f=delete` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter, which is directly inserted into an SQL query.
- Example PoC (Proof of Concept) shows how to exploit the vulnerability using `updatexml()` function:
  ```
  id=11' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(database())),3)-- q
  ```
  This payload aims to extract the database name.
- The application uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the POST request.
- A cookie `PHPSESSID` is part of the request.
