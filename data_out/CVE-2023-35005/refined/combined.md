Previously we had them defined both in constant and in config.yml.

Now just config.yml

This change does however cause config.yml to be loaded when the sensitive\_config\_values property is accessed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Lazy loading that means it should only matter when someone hits the config page right? Seems good to me - that is as long as we ship the config yaml in the dist, but I'm not sure if we do or don't

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Lazy loading that means it should only matter when someone hits the config page right? Seems good to me - that is as long as we ship the config yaml in the dist, but I'm not sure if we do or don't  ah yes, at first glance i thought this property might have gotten loaded up every time airflow conf got loaded but, i think you're right it's only invoked via webserver / configuration view  so i think performance of loading the yaml is non-issue |
