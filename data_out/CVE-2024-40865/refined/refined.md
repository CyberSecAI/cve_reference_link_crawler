- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inputs to the virtual keyboard may be inferred from Persona.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Inputs to the virtual keyboard can be inferred from the Persona feature, potentially revealing sensitive information entered by the user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could observe the Persona feature and derive input to the virtual keyboard. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to observe the Persona feature while a user is interacting with the virtual keyboard.
