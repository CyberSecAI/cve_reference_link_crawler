The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘display_name’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 12.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
