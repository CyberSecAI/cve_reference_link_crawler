Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability present in the `formApPortalAccessCodeAuth` function of the Tenda i22 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `formApPortalAccessCodeAuth` function copies user-supplied data (from the `accessCode`, `data`, and `acceInfo` parameters in a POST request) to stack-allocated buffers using `strcpy` and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write past the end of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses, redirect program execution to malicious code, and ultimately achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable device.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the stack may also lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/apPortalAccessCodeAuth` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable parameters:** The `accessCode`, `data`, and `acceInfo` parameters of the POST request are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Tenda i22 device.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement for exploiting this vulnerability, suggesting it may be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Tenda i22 firmware version V1.0.0.3(4687).
- The provided PoC demonstrates sending an oversized value for the `accessCode` parameter in the POST request, which is sufficient to trigger the overflow.
- The specific functions and usage of `strcpy` and `sprintf` are illustrated in the provided screenshots, showing that data from the POST request is being copied to the stack without bounds checks.
