**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue in the "Ultimate Bootstrap Elements for Elementor" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin allows a malicious actor to include local files from the target website. This likely stems from insecure handling of file paths or user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information like configuration files containing database credentials.
*   **Potential Database Takeover:** If the attacker is able to read files containing database credentials, they could potentially gain complete control of the database depending on the server's configuration.
*   **Website Compromise:** Depending on the files that are exposed, an attacker could potentially achieve complete website compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by including local files using a flaw in the plugin's code. The exact method of exploitation isn't specified in the given context, but typically involves manipulating parameters or paths in a way that forces the application to load and display unauthorized local files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Role:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as a "Low" priority issue.
