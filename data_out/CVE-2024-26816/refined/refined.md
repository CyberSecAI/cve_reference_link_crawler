{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into the .notes section so that Xen can find the \"startup_xen\" entry point. Performing relocations against the .notes section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes is world-readable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Exposure of KASLR base"
    ],
    "impact": "The Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) base address is exposed through the world-readable /sys/kernel/notes interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Reading /sys/kernel/notes"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Unprivileged access to the /sys/kernel/notes interface"
  },
  "affected_configurations": [
    "Linux kernel with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y"
  ],
    "patch": "The fix involves skipping relocations in the .notes section within the arch/x86/tools/relocs.c file, ensuring that values within the .notes section remain identical to those in System.map."
