- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Race condition in the System Management Mode (SMM) of the BIOS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass security checks during SMM, leading to potential compromise of the system. Specifically, the impact includes low confidentiality, high integrity and no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious input using System Management Interrupts (SMI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local with high privileges.
