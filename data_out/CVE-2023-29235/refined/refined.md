{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Maintenance Switch plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unintended actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering a malicious request. No specific user role is required, but the higher the privileges of the user that triggers the request, the more severe the impact will be."
