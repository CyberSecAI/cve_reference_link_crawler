Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy in data type definitions between the backend code and the database schema for the `status` parameter. The backend defines it as a `String`, while the database uses a `char` type which has a fixed length. When a string longer than the fixed `char` length is inserted, it causes an error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage through error messages. By sending a request with a `status` parameter that exceeds the expected length of the database column type (char), an error message is triggered which reveals sensitive information, including the SQL query being executed. This is due to insufficient input validation/sanitization on the status parameter in combination with the database schema mismatch and the way the errors are displayed to users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of SQL queries:** An attacker can learn the exact SQL query being used by the application. This can allow the attacker to understand the structure of the database and how queries are being made
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Knowing the SQL query structure can facilitate further exploitation like SQL injection attacks. Though not directly mentioned in this case, the exposure of the SQL query increases the risk.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/system/dept/edit` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated `status` parameter:** The key to triggering the vulnerability is to add extra characters after the status parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send HTTP requests to `/system/dept/edit`.
*   **Understanding of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **Basic understanding of the application's functionality:** The attacker needs to know the location and function of the `/system/dept/edit` endpoint and how parameters are passed in.
