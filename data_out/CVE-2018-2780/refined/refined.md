Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-2780:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content from Red Hat, Ubuntu, Oracle and NetApp all list CVE-2018-2780 as a vulnerability addressed in their respective security updates. This confirms that the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability in the "Optimizer" component of the MySQL server.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness lies within the MySQL query optimizer.  This component is responsible for selecting the most efficient method of executing SQL queries. A flaw in its logic can be exploited.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access or a denial of service (DoS) of the MySQL Server. Specifically:
    *   **Unauthorized Read/Modification Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to data that should be restricted.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server could be made to hang or crash repeatedly.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is network-based, by sending crafted SQL queries to the MySQL server.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would typically need network access to a vulnerable MySQL server.
    *   For some aspects of exploitation, such as privilege escalation, the attacker might need some level of existing privileges/access to the database. However, some of the vulnerabilities listed in the advisories can be exploited without requiring authentication, which potentially allows for remote exploitation.

**3. Additional Technical Details (From different sources):**

*   **Red Hat:** The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:3655) lists CVE-2018-2780 under the "mysql: Server: Optimizer unspecified vulnerability (CPU Apr 2018)". They rate the overall security impact of the update as "Moderate" and lists the affected products as Red Hat Software Collections for various RHEL versions.
*   **Ubuntu:** The Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-3629-1 and USN-3629-3) mention this CVE as part of a larger set of MySQL vulnerabilities being fixed. They include new upstream MySQL versions to address the issue and list the affected Ubuntu versions.
*   **Oracle:** The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018, includes CVE-2018-2780 as a vulnerability fixed in their MySQL Server. It states that the attack vector for the specific vulnerability requires authentication. The advisory also lists the affected MySQL server versions (5.5.59 and prior, 5.6.39 and prior, 5.7.21 and prior).
*   **NetApp:**  NetApp advisory NTAP-20180419-0002 also lists CVE-2018-2780 as part of a larger set of MySQL vulnerabilities affecting multiple NetApp products. They detail the potential impact, including unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server, unauthorized data access, and DoS.

**4. Summary of Findings**

The combined information from these sources indicates that CVE-2018-2780 is a moderately severe vulnerability in the MySQL query optimizer, potentially allowing for unauthorized access or DoS through specially crafted SQL queries.  Different advisories provide details on the affected product and versions for the respective vendors.

**Note:** Some of the sources provide more details than the official CVE description, like the specific components affected within MySQL (e.g. 'Optimizer') and some potential attack scenarios (DoS or unauthorized data access).
