{
  "CVE-2021-23839": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementation of the padding check for SSLv2 version rollback protection inverted the logic. The connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect implementation of SSLv2 rollback protection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred, and will erroneously reject a normal SSLv2 connection attempt.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A client attempting to negotiate SSLv2 with a server configured to support SSLv2 and more recent versions."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to initiate a connection attempt with a server supporting SSLv2."
  }
}
