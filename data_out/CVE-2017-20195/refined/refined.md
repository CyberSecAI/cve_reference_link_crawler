The provided content is related to a commit that addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities, which could be related to CVE-2017-20195, if the CVE is about SQL Injection.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection because user-provided inputs (`$phone` and `$problem`) were not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries (although the actual SQL query is not shown). This allowed attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, stemming from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `request.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful SQL injection could allow attackers to:
    *   Access sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through user-submitted form data via the `POST` method, specifically the `phone` and `problem` fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to access the application's web form, and have the ability to input malicious SQL code into the `phone` and `problem` fields.

**Mitigation:**

*   The commit attempts to mitigate the vulnerability by:
    *   Using `strip_tags()` to remove HTML and PHP tags from input strings.
    *   Implementing regular expressions using `preg_match()` to block common SQL keywords (`DROP`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `TABLE`, `DELETE`, and `;`). This prevents basic SQL injection attempts.
    
**Additional Notes:**
*   The commit message explicitly states "Added simple SQL injection prevention on request.php".
*   The comments in the code also show the developer trying to prevent SQL injection.

While this commit attempts to remediate SQL injection issues by blocking certain SQL keywords, it's not a foolproof solution. More robust techniques like parameterized queries or prepared statements would provide a better defense.
