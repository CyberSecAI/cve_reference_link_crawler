Generate S3 server credentials on-the-fly

```
To improve the security of GitOps Run we now generate access and
secret keys each time the `gitops beta run` command is run. These
credentials are passed on to the S3 server and used in the client code
for authentication.
```

# GitOps Run allows for Kubernetes workload injection

High

published
GHSA-wr3c-g326-486c
Jan 9, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v0.11.0

## Patched versions

v0.12.0

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources.

GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronising files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to block unauthorised access, therefore allowing local users (and processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content.

By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed by commits [75268c4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3114/commits/75268c4d2c8f7e4db22c63d76b451ba6545d117f) and [966823b](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3102/commits/966823bbda8c539a4661e2a4f8607c9307ba6225). Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
