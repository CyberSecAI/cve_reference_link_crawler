## Description

### Impact

Poor input validation allows for SQL Injection in Tree data entry point.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere

with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an

attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include

data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to

access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent

changes to the application's content or behavior.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
