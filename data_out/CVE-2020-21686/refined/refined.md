{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stack-use-after-scope in the `expand_mmac_params` function at `asm/preproc.c:4931`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-use-after-scope. The code attempts to write to a memory location on the stack after the scope in which it was valid has ended.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The provided ASAN log indicates a write of size 8 to an invalid memory location on the stack, which can cause a crash or potentially be leveraged for more serious attacks. The program aborts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted assembly file with NASM. The specific command provided to trigger the bug is `nasm -o /dev/null -f bin $PoC` where `$PoC` is a file containing the malicious assembly code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted assembly file to the NASM assembler."
