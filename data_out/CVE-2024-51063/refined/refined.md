Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51063

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `add-teacher.php` functionality of the Phpgurukul Teachers Record Management System v2.1. Specifically, the `mobile number` and `email` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `add-teacher.php` page.
*   The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `mobile number` or `email` parameters within the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This could be from an internal or external network depending on the application's accessibility.
*  The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters (`mobile number` and `email`) in the `add-teacher.php` functionality.
*  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information from Content:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Abhijith Narayanan in October 2024.
*   The content includes a basic Proof of Concept (PoC) describing the steps to inject SQL queries.
