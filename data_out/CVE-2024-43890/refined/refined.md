The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tracing_map->next_elt` variable in the `get_free_elt()` function of the Linux kernel tracing subsystem is at risk of overflowing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The atomic increment of `tracing_map->next_elt` was not properly checked against the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`). This allowed `next_elt` to wrap around to 0 after reaching the maximum value.
- Infinite Loop: If new elements were inserted into the tracing map after the overflow, the map would reach its maximum size (`tracing_map->max_size`), leaving no free entries. Subsequent attempts to insert elements into a full map using `__tracing_map_insert()` would result in an infinite loop with preemption disabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service condition, resulting in a CPU hang.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by continuously inserting elements into the tracing map until it overflows.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the insertion of a sufficient number of elements into the tracing map to cause the overflow. This likely requires some form of privileged access to interact with the kernel tracing interface.

**Technical Details:**
The fix replaces `atomic_inc_return` with `atomic_fetch_add_unless`. This prevents any further increments to `tracing_map->next_elt` when it equals `tracing_map->max_elts`. Additionally, `atomic_set(&map->next_elt, -1);` was changed to `atomic_set(&map->next_elt, 0);` when the tracing map is cleared or created.
