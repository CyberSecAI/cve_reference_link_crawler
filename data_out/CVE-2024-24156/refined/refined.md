The provided content is related to CVE-2024-24156.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wr_content` parameter, used when writing a comment, is not sanitized for HTML tags. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of users who view the comment, leading to potential information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious comment containing HTML/JavaScript code, and sending it to the server via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server, using tools like Burp Suite or requests library, bypassing normal browser input restrictions on HTML tags in the comment field.
