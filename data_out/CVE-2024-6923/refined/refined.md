{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The email module in CPython did not properly quote newlines in email headers during serialization, allowing for header injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of newlines during email header serialization, leading to header injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject arbitrary email headers, leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information, message manipulation, or bypassing email filters.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could include unquoted newlines within header values, which would be interpreted as separate headers by a receiving email server when the message is serialized.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to control the content of an email header that is being serialized by the vulnerable CPython code. No other specific capabilities or positions are explicitly mentioned."
