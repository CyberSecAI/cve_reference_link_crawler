| Bug reportBug description: *I'm not sure if this is a bug, feature request, or user error. I'm happy to re-file once I know which*  If a parsed email header contains a correctly quoted newline, setting an email header to that value will include a newline.  ``` from email import message_from_string from email.policy import default  email_in = """\ To: incoming+tag@me.example.com From: External Sender <sender@them.example.com> Subject: Here's an =?UTF-8?Q?embedded_newline=0A?= Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable MIME-Version: 1.0  <html> <head><title>An embeded newline</title></head> <body>   <p>I sent you an embedded newline in the subject. How do you like that?!</p> </body> </html> """  msg = message_from_string(email_in, policy=default) msg = message_from_string(email_in, policy=default) for header, value in msg.items():     del msg[header]     msg[header] = value email_out = str(msg) print(email_out) ```  Output is:  ``` To: incoming+tag@me.example.com From: External Sender <sender@them.example.com> Subject: Here's an embedded newline  Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable MIME-Version: 1.0  <html> <head><title>An embeded newline</title></head> <body>   <p>I sent you an embedded newline in the subject. How do you like that?!</p> </body> </html>  ```  An email parser will interpret the newline as the start of the message. In this case, the `Content-Type` and other MIME headers will not be processed, and the email treated as plain text. In other cases, required headers like `To` may not be processed and the email will not be delivered.  I'd expect an error on setting the value, an error on serializing the `EmailMessage` to a string, the subject to retain the original encoding, or the newline to be quoted in the serialized version.  Now that we know the behavior, we can process the headers (embed or strip trailing newlines). However, you may see this is a bug, a needed feature, or missing documentation.  More info:  `subject`'s type is a `email.headerregistry._UniqueUnstructuredHeader`. It has a `name`, so it is assigned without checking (`email.policy.EmailPolicy.header_store_parse()`).  The `_parse_tree`, returned by `email._header_value_parser.get_unstructured()`, is:  ``` UnstructuredTokenList([ValueTerminal("Here's"), WhiteSpaceTerminal(' '), ValueTerminal('an'), WhiteSpaceTerminal(' '), EncodedWord([ValueTerminal('embedded'), WhiteSpaceTerminal(' '), ValueTerminal('newline\n')])])  ```  A user encountered this for our email relaying service <https://relay.firefox.com> ([mozilla/fx-private-relay#4841](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues/4841)). An incoming email to a service address is matched to a user. We re-write the email headers and forward the email to the user's "real" address.  A real email has this subject header:  ``` Subject: The All Over Piercings Wishlist of =?UTF-8?Q?John=2E=0A?=  ```  This is from a European website <https://www.alloverpiercings.com>. You can create a wishlist and send it to an email address. The subject appears correctly encoded to me, to allow for non-ASCII usernames, with the unfortunate embedded newline. When forwarding this email, using something similar to the code above (but with more header modifications and additions), the embedded newline is turned into a real newline. The rest of the email headers are treated as part of the body. Since the `Content-Type` and other MIME headers are not processed as headers, the email is treated as a plain text email.

| On further investigation, a plain string with a trailing newline has this issue:  ``` email["Subject"] = "string with newlines\n"  ```  So the "re-use parsed header" is not part of the issue. The problem might be the newline detection in `header_store_parse`:     [cpython/Lib/email/policy.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/dc03ce797ae8786a9711e6ee5dcaadde02c55864/Lib/email/policy.py#L131-L148)  Lines 131 to 148 in [dc03ce7](/python/cpython/commit/dc03ce797ae8786a9711e6ee5dcaadde02c55864)   |  | def header\_store\_parse(self, name, value): | | --- | --- | |  | """+ | |  | The name is returned unchanged.

| This is a bug (I was able to reproduce this on the CPython main branch), and looks like a minor security problem, considering this:  An email parser will interpret the newline as the start of the message.  For example, I could see someone developing an app that does something like this:  ``` def email_notification(name: str):     msg = EmailMessage()     msg.set_content("This is an automatic notification blah blah blah...")     msg["Subject"] = (         f"{name} sent you a message!"     )     smtp_server.send_message(msg) ```  If a user set their name to something like `"=?UTF-8?Q?=0A?==?UTF-8?Q?=0A?=This comes before the actual body!"`, then `This comes before the actual body!` would precedent the rest of the message. (FWIW, I'm not a security researcher nor a cybersecurity expert, this is speculative.)  Furthermore, you could use this to inject extra message headers. |

| It seems to be a bug, or two even.  ``` msg = email.message.EmailMessage(policy=default) msg['Subject'] = 'A 💩 subject\nBcc: injected@example.com' print(str(msg)) ```  The above throws a ValueError("Header values may not contain linefeed or carriage return characters"), as expected.  However the following does not, and inserts an extra newline, thus invalidating some headers:  ``` msg = email.message.EmailMessage(policy=default) msg['Subject'] = 'A 💩 subject\n' msg.set_content('This is 💩 the body of the message.\n') print(str(msg)) ```  and by using an utf8 encoded newline, it even inserts an extra header  ``` msg = email.message.EmailMessage(policy=default) msg['Subject'] = 'A 💩 subject=?UTF-8?Q?=0A?=Bcc: injected@example.com' msg.set_content('This is 💩 the body of the message.\n') print(str(msg)) ```  .  So, I think two things have to be solved:   1. newlines at the end should either throw a ValueError, like in the middle, or be stripped, as they are not allowed by the rfc 2. encoded newlines should also throw a ValueError.   [@encukou](https://github.com/encukou) : I'll try to fix both during (or after) the EuroPython sprint, ok? |

GH-GH- Encode header parts that contain newlines

Per RFC 2047:

> [...] these encoding schemes allow the

> recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

GH-GH- Verify that email headers are well-formed

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

It seems that the "quoted-word" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

### **[medmunds](/medmunds)** commented [Aug 6, 2024](#issuecomment-2272166965)

| [#121284](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121284) turns out to be a variation of this, where refolding a parsed RFC 2047 encoded-word can leak 'specials' characters into structured headers without proper quoting/encoding. The security issue is not quite as severe as letting newlines leak in, but unquoted specials can allow manipulation of the message sender and recipients. |

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

(cherry picked from commit 097633981879b3c9de9a1dd120d3aa585ecc2384)

This patch also contains modified commit cherry picked from
c5bba853d5e7836f6d4340e18721d3fb3a6ee0f7.

This commit was backported to simplify the backport of the other commit
fixing CVE. The only modification is a removal of one test case which
tests multiple changes in Python 3.7 and it wasn't working properly
with Python 3.6 where we backported only one change.

`[[3.9]](/python/cpython/commit/f7be505d137a22528cb0fc004422c0081d5d90e6 "[3.9] gh-121650: Encode newlines in headers, and verify headers are sound (GH-122233) (#122610)

Per RFC 2047:

> [...] these encoding schemes allow the
> encoding of arbitrary octet values, mail readers that implement this
> decoding should also ensure that display of the decoded data on the
> recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.
