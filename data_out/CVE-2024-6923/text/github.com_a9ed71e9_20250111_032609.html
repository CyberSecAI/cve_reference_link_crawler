Re: [#121812](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121812)

Hello [@basbloemsaat](https://github.com/basbloemsaat),

I've spent the day reading through the email module, and RFCs, and I believe I found a better place to fix the issue.

This involved lots of experimentation, so I'm sending an alternative PR rather than a review on yours.

* The generator (writer) verifies that the representation of each header is sound (a parser won't treat it as multiple headers, start-of-body, or part of another header). That should cover custom `fold()` implementations or `Header` subclasses.

  + However, some user out there is probably misusing such header injection in working code, so, I added a policy attribute to turn it back.
* Newlines are *encoded* in `fold()`, just like undecodable bytes and other special characters.

Overall, this means that we treat newlines as valid *content* of headers, but “escape” them when such a header is *serialized* to text.

This PR is a proof of concept. It needs tests and documentation, but I'm out of time for today, and I wanted to share what I have.

Does this look reasonable to you?

* Issue: [email.policy.default - gotcha with re-using parsed headers with embedded newlines #121650](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121650)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Per RFC 2047:

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

| That sounds entirely reasonable, and conforms to the RFCs.  Two points:   1. what would be the use of keeping this check in email.policy.header\_store\_parse ? 2. I found one case that is not covered by this (contrived, I admit):  ``` from email import message_from_string  email_in = """ Subject: foo <bar>\nBCC: injected@example.com To: incoming+tag@me.example.com From: External Sender <sender@them.example.com>  message body """  msg = message_from_string(email_in) print(msg) ``` |

| what would be the use of keeping this check in email.policy.header\_store\_parse ?  This is in the branch that handles strings (rather than custom Header object). I'm not clears what kind of format that string is supposed to be in. Keeping the check means that if someone relied on this, they'll get the same error as before. Also, the indication that something is wrong will come earlier.  I found one case that is not covered by this (contrived, I admit)  That `\n` there is Python syntax, by the time it gets to `message_from_string` it's the same as a “real” newline. If you use a raw string `r"""`, or read from a file, the header remains on a single line. |

GH-GH- Encode header parts that contain newlines

Per RFC 2047:

> [...] these encoding schemes allow the
> encoding of arbitrary octet values, mail readers that implement this

> recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

GH-GH- Verify that email headers are well-formed

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

gh-121650: Encode newlines in headers, and verify headers are sound (GH-122233)

GH-GH- Encode header parts that contain newlines

Per RFC 2047:

> [...] these encoding schemes allow the
> encoding of arbitrary octet values, mail readers that implement this
> decoding should also ensure that display of the decoded data on the
> recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

GH-GH- Verify that email headers are well-formed

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

> recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.

It seems that the \"quoted-word\" scheme is a valid way to include
a newline character in a header value, just like we already allow
undecodable bytes or control characters.
They do need to be properly quoted when serialized to text, though.

This should fail for custom fold() implementations that aren't careful
about newlines.
