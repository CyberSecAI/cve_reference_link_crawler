# CVE-2024-6409

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2024-6387.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2024-6472.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2024-6409 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6409)

#### Description

A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.
