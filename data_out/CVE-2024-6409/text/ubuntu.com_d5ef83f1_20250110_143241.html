A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by
OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within
a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously.
However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not
async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful
attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a
remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd
server.

## Notes

---

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices
that
cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not
provide security
support for this package if doing so would prevent access to
equipment.

---

### [sbeattie](https://launchpad.net/~sbeattie)

Potential issue appears to have only been present in
openssh 8.7p1 and 8.8p1, versions not present in currently supported
Ubuntu releases.
