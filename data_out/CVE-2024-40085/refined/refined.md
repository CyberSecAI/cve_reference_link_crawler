{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `local_app_set_router_wan()` function in the `hlRouterApp` binary does not perform bounds checking when copying the `pppoe_username` and `pppoe_password` fields into fixed-size 128-byte buffers on the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the LAN can cause a buffer overflow leading to memory corruption and potentially achieve Remote Code Execution and gain root access to the Vilo router.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker connected to the router's LAN can send crafted JSON messages to the local service running on port 5432 that includes overly long PPPoE username and password fields.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same LAN as the router and able to interact with the local service on port 5432 using the custom protocol (which is XXTEA encrypted)."
