# Directory Listing via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS

High

[LinkLeong](/LinkLeong)
published
GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/
(ZimaOS)

## Affected versions

<=1.2.4

## Patched versions

1.2.5

## Description

### Summary

The API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

### PoC

1. Authenticate to ZimaOS and obtain a valid session token.
2. Use the following request to manipulate the path parameter and list the contents of the /etc directory:

   `GET http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file?path=%2Fetc&index=0&size=10000&sfz=true&sort=name&direction=asc`

   Response:

```
{
    "files": [
        {"name": "passwd", "type": "file"},
        {"name": "shadow", "type": "file"},
        {"name": "hostname", "type": "file"},
        {"name": "hosts", "type": "file"},
        {"name": "network", "type": "directory"},
        ...
    ]
}

```

This response reveals the contents of the `/etc` directory, exposing system configuration files such as `/etc/passwd`, /etc/shadow, and more.

### Impact

* Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can view the contents of system directories, exposing files like `/etc/passwd`, which can lead to further attacks, including privilege escalation or unauthorized access.
* Preparation for Other Attacks: Knowing which files and directories exist on the system enables attackers to target specific files for unauthorized access or file inclusion attacks.
* Increased Risk of Privilege Escalation: Access to files like `/etc/shadow` could lead to password cracking, allowing attackers to escalate privileges.

### Recommendation

1. Input Validation: Restrict the path parameter to only allow access to predefined directories that are safe for users to interact with. Disallow the listing of critical system directories like `/etc`.
2. Whitelist Allowed Directories: Implement a whitelist of directories that users are allowed to access, ensuring that any requests outside these directories are rejected.
3. Example of restricting file access to specific directories:

```
import os

def secure_directory_access(requested_path):
    allowed_directories = ["/var/user_files", "/home/user"]
    base_directory = os.path.realpath("/var")

    full_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(base_directory, requested_path))

    if not any(full_path.startswith(allowed) for allowed in allowed_directories):
        return "Access Denied", 403

    # Proceed with listing files in the directory
    return list_files(full_path)

```

4. Access Control: Implement fine-grained access control to ensure that only authorized users can access certain directories. Limit file listings to user-specific or application-specific directories.
5. Logging and Monitoring: Log attempts to access sensitive directories and generate alerts for suspicious activity. Regular monitoring can help detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts in a timely manner.

### Possible Fix Code:

Here’s an example code snippet that restricts directory listing to only safe, predefined directories:

```
import os

def list_files_in_secure_directory(path):
    base_directory = "/var/safe_directories/"

    # Get the real path to avoid directory traversal
    requested_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(base_directory, path))

    # Ensure the path is within the allowed base directory
    if not requested_path.startswith(base_directory):
        return "Access Denied", 403

    # Proceed with listing the files
    try:
        files = os.listdir(requested_path)
        return files, 200
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Directory Not Found", 404

```

This code ensures that users can only list files within the `/var/safe_directories/` directory and prevents access to system-critical directories like `/etc`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
