Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an AJAX action endpoint within the "Document Embedder" WordPress plugin that does not properly restrict access to post metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to the `pdfp_get_doc_meta` AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user to query and retrieve the title of private and draft posts. This constitutes a sensitive data exposure vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin does not verify if an authenticated user has the appropriate permissions to access the metadata of the requested post.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate the titles of private and draft posts that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. This can reveal sensitive information about upcoming content, internal discussions, or proprietary data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out through HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the WordPress site (e.g., a subscriber-level account).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable AJAX endpoint is located at `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The specific action that is exploitable is `pdfp_get_doc_meta`.
- The attacker can specify the post ID as a parameter using `id=`.
- The vulnerability was present in versions of Document Embedder prior to 1.7.9.
