## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking < 4.1.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Copy Protection"
2. Acces the "Styles" tab
3. For the "Custom class for tooltip container" field enter the payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
4. Save the settings and see the XSS trigger
