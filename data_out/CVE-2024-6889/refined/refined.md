- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings. Specifically, the "Custom class for tooltip container" field within the plugin's "Styles" tab is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input before storing it in the database and outputting it in the application, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered by saving malicious code in the "Custom class for tooltip container" option, which is then stored and later rendered on the front-end, thus triggering the injected JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or other high privilege user access (e.g. administrator) to configure the pluginâ€™s settings.
