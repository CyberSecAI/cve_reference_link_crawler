The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43886.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference that occurs when switching from "Extend" to "Second Display Only" display modes. During this transition, the `resource_get_otg_master_for_stream` function is sometimes called on a disconnected eDP stream, leading to a null pointer being returned and subsequently dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code lacks a check to ensure the pointer returned by `resource_get_otg_master_for_stream` is valid before using it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: Dereferencing a null pointer will cause the kernel to crash leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a specific display mode switch: Switching from "Extend" to "Second Display Only" modes can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the display settings, specifically switch the display mode from "Extend" to "Second Display Only".
