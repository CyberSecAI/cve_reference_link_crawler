- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP CSV Exporter plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when creating CSV files, leading to CSV injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can craft malicious formulas within the CSV data. When opened in spreadsheet software, these formulas could be executed, potentially leading to exploitation of vulnerabilities in the software or execution of commands on the victim's PC, granting the attacker unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious formulas into the CSV data generated by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the data included in the exported CSV file. The required privilege level is a "Contributor" which suggests that an attacker with lower than admin level access could be capable of exploiting the vulnerability.
