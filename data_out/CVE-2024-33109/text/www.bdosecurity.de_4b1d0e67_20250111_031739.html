## CVE Details

##### Description:

A relative directory traversal vulnerability in the web interface of the Tiptel IP 286 telephone with firmware version 2.61.13.10 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the phone via the ringtone upload function. This enables manipulation of configuration files, for example in the /etc directory. This can be exploited to gain root access to the underlying Linux system via Telnet.

##### Remediation:

As the phone model is end of life for more than 5 years, the manufacturer no longer provides software fixes. Thus, the phone should be replaced by a modern device which is still under support. As a temporary workaround, it should be ensured that Telnet is deactivated in the settings and that the settings are secured with a reasonably strong password so that no one can access the Telnet and ringtone upload functions.
