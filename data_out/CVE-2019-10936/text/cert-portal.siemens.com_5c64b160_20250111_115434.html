GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Development/Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO are used to develop compact or modular PROFINET field
devices.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SIMATIC Compact Field Unit (SIMATIC CFU) is a smart field distributor for use as an I/O device on
PROFINET of an automation system.

SIMATIC ET 200 Interface modules for PROFINET IO are used to connect field devices (IO Devices) to
controllers (IO Controller) via PROFINET.

PROFINET Driver is a development kit used to develop PROFINET IO controllers.

SIMATIC S7-300, S7-400, S7-1200 CPU and S7-1500 CPU controllers have been designed for discrete
and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and
chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC TDC is a multiprocessor automation system for drive, control and technology tasks. The system
is used particularly for large plants.

SIMATIC WinAC RTX is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

With the SINAMICS converter series you can solve drive tasks in the low, medium and DC voltage range.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop floor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10936

Affected devices improperly handle large amounts of specially crafted UDP packets.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a denial of service condition.
