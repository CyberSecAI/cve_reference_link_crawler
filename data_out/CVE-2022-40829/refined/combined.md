| \_wh()„ÄÅ\_where\_in()„ÄÅ\_like() do not filter on query fields, If the developer incorrectly receives the query fields from the client, it can lead to SQL injection.  Example: <https://github.com/726232111/CodeIgniter3.1.13-SQL-Inject/blob/main/README.md>  I'm not sure if this is assessed as a security issue. |

| I managed to have a look before your repo went away.  Considering that all the following were happening:   1. You were using the `information_schema` as the main database; 2. You were allowing user input unsanitized/without any pre-DB checks as a database value; 3. You allowed the column name to be entirely decided by a GET value.   ... then I don't know what else is much left to say here. Unless you really have a real-life, production situation where this happened, this is only carelessly programming and SQL injection should be the last thing to consider.  Last, but not least: we have information about how (and where) security reports should be done in the `README` file. |

Seems like you haven't noticed that 1) the video is on CI4 (this is CI3) 2) the actual bug is in the controller (specifically the input validation), not in CI query builder... |

| Is the vulnerability which is shown in the video reported as a bug somewhere? It does look like a relatively easy mistake for inexperienced developers to make. At least the documentation should explain that keys won't be sql-escaped, if it doesn't already make that clear. |
