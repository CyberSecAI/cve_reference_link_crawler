| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8178#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-02-04 11:30:44 UTC  ``` 上报人信息：   - 白家驹 <baijiaju@buaa.edu.cn>   - 北京航空航天大学网络空间安全学院  成因： 在dvbdmx_write函数中，检查demux->frontend指针非空后进行了解引用，但检查demux->frontend指针非空和解引用没有持有锁，demux->frontend在检查后仍有可能被其他线程的dvbdmx_disconnect_frontend等函数置空，从而触发空指针解引用。  危害： 该模块被编译进内核里，发生空指针解引用会导致kernel panic并挂起系统，可以用于拒绝服务攻击。  漏洞修复缓解： 将检查demux->frontend非空和解引用的过程用dvbdemux->mutex保护，防止demux->frontend被并发置空。补丁已提交给Linux Kernel Media子系统维护者，补丁链接：[https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20230626024429.994136-1-islituo@gmail.com/](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20230626024429.994136-1-islituo%40gmail.com/)  [https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230626024429.994136-1-islituo@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230626024429.994136-1-islituo%40gmail.com/) ``` |  |
