| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2258456#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-01-15 13:16:32 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in 3Scale when using with Keycloak 15 (or RHSSO 7.5.0) and superiors. When the auth_type is use_3scale_oidc_issuer_endpoint, Token Introspection policy discovers the Token Introspection endpoint from the token_introspection_endpoint field, but the field was removed on RH-SSO 7.5. As the result, the policy doesn't inspect tokens; it determines that all tokens are valid.   Using an alternate auth_type: auth_type: client_id+client_secret. Disabling the policy entirely might be a temporary solution if the alternate {{auth_type is not feasible for some reason. The only purpose the token introspection endpoint serves is for sessions which are revoked in RH SSO *before the standard TTL expires via the exp claim.   ``` |  |
