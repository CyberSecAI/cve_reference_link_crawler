- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer access vulnerability exists in the Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer access vulnerability (reading out of bounds) due to insufficient input validation in Dell BIOS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user with administrator privileges can exploit the vulnerability to read certain sections of memory by providing input larger than expected. This could lead to information disclosure and potentially further system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an input larger than expected to the BIOS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
