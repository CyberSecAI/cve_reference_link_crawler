Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection vulnerability in the `teacher_login.php` file of the Simple School Management System. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the username and password fields.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the use of `'or 1=1-- -` in the username field allows an attacker to bypass authentication by injecting a condition that will always evaluate to true, effectively logging in without valid credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism for the teacher login page and gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `teacher_login.php` page, where the attacker can manipulate the username and password input fields with malicious SQL injection payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the login page at "<http://localhost/School/teacher_login.php>".
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a valid exploit.

The provided content gives a proof-of-concept for exploiting the vulnerability:
1.  Navigate to the login page.
2.  Enter the following as username: `'or 1=1-- -`
3.  Enter `1` as the password.
4.  Log in.

This bypasses the login and grants access.
