- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A JavaScript payload added to the product name can be executed on the storefront when a user adds a note to a shopping list line item that contains the vulnerable product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must first be able to edit a product in the admin area and inject the malicious payload into the product name, and then must trick a user into adding the crafted product to their Shopping List and then click the "add a note" option on the shopping list item.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges to edit product names in the admin area, and the attack requires user interaction of clicking "add a note" on a shopping list item.
