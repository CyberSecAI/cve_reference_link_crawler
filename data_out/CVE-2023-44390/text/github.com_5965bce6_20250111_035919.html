# XSS in Foreign Content

Moderate

[mganss](/mganss)
published
GHSA-43cp-6p3q-2pc4
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

nuget

HtmlSanitizer
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

<= 8.0.718, <= 8.1.719-beta

## Patched versions

8.0.723, 8.1.722-beta

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed elements.

Specifically, the requirements for the vulnerability are:

1. Allowing one foreign element: `svg`, or `math`
2. Comments or one raw text element: `iframe`, `noembed`, `xmp`, `title`, `noframes`, `style` or `noscript`

Configurations that meet the above requirements plus the following are vulnerable to an additional vulnerability:

* Any HTML integration element: `title`, `desc`, `mi`, `mo`, `mn`, `ms`, `mtext`, `annotation-xml`.

In case an application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable configuration, an attacker could

bypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code.

Note that in the default configuration the vulnerability is not present.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta (preview version).

### Workarounds

Disallow foreign elements `svg` and `math`. This is the case in the default configuration, which is therefore not affected by the vulnerability.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-44390

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
