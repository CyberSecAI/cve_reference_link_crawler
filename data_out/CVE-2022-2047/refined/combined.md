Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.16-0+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2047 CVE-2022-2048

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty, a Java servlet engine
and webserver.

CVE-2022-2047

    In Eclipse Jetty the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme
    URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a
    hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.

CVE-2022-2048

    In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid
    HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly
    cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead
    to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to
    process good requests.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.4.16-0+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

# Invalid URI parsing may produce invalid HttpURI.authority

published
GHSA-cj7v-27pg-wf7q
Jul 7, 2022

## Package

maven

jetty-http
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<=9.4.46,<=10.0.9,<=11.0.9

## Patched versions

9.4.47,10.0.10,11.0.10

## Description

### Description

URI use within Jetty's `HttpURI` class can parse invalid URIs such as `http://localhost;/path` as having an authority with a host of `localhost;`.

A URIs of the type `http://localhost;/path` should be interpreted to be either invalid or as `localhost;` to be the userinfo and no host.

However, `HttpURI.host` returns `localhost;` which is definitely wrong.

### Impact

This can lead to errors with Jetty's `HttpClient`, and Jetty's `ProxyServlet` / `AsyncProxyServlet` / `AsyncMiddleManServlet` wrongly interpreting an authority with no host as one with a host.

### Patches

Patched in PR [#8146](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/8146) for Jetty version 9.4.47.

Patched in PR [#8014](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/8015) for Jetty versions 10.0.10, and 11.0.10

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
