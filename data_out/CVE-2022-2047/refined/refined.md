Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2047:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Eclipse Jetty's `HttpURI` class parses the authority segment of an HTTP scheme URI. It incorrectly identifies an invalid input as a hostname. Specifically, URIs like `http://localhost;/path` are parsed such that `localhost;` is incorrectly identified as the host instead of either being considered an invalid URI or `localhost;` being userinfo with no host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `HttpURI` class fails to properly validate the authority segment of a URI, leading to misinterpretation of the host. This is a classic case of CWE-20, Improper Input Validation.
*   **Incorrect Host Parsing:** The method returns an incorrect value for the host, `localhost;` in the example `http://localhost;/path`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Proxy Failures:** This incorrect parsing can lead to failures in proxy scenarios.
*   **Incorrect Behavior of Jetty Components:** Specifically, Jetty's `HttpClient`, `ProxyServlet`, `AsyncProxyServlet`, and `AsyncMiddleManServlet` might wrongly interpret an authority without a host as one with a host, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although the provided information doesn't specify further exploitation details, the vulnerability might be used as part of a larger attack chain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a malformed URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Jetty server.
*   The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) to exploit this vulnerability according to the CVSS vector. It is not clear if this is accurate.
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.0 through 9.4.46, 10.0.0 through 10.0.9, and 11.0.0 through 11.0.9.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Jetty versions 9.4.47, 10.0.10, and 11.0.10.
*   NetApp has identified multiple products that use vulnerable versions of Eclipse Jetty and has provided updates to mitigate the issue.

In summary, CVE-2022-2047 is caused by improper input validation in Jetty's URI parsing logic which can result in the incorrect interpretation of a URI host and impact proxying capabilities.
