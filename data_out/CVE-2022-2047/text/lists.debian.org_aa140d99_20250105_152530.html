Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.16-0+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2047 CVE-2022-2048

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty, a Java servlet engine
and webserver.

CVE-2022-2047

    In Eclipse Jetty the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme
    URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a
    hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.

CVE-2022-2048

    In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid
    HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly
    cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead
    to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to
    process good requests.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.4.16-0+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.
