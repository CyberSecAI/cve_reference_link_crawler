CVE-2024-24681: Insecure AES key in Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
A single, vendorwide, hardcoded AES key in the configuration tool used to
encrypt provisioning documents was leaked leading to a compromise of
confidentiality of provisioning documents.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool (AES version)
* Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool (RSA version <v1.2)

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================

```
The Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool facilites provisioning and
configuration mangement
of Yealink products, such as VoIP phones. The tool created AES encrypted
provisioning
```

documents, containing configuration directives such as
username=user1
passwword=passw0rd!
serverhost=sip.host.com
callerid=+19051231212

```
The files created by this tool are then transferred to the Yealink
equipment. The equipment
```

decrypts the files and uses them to configure itself.
This process needs to be secure. So these files are encrypted.

```
The decryption is done by a static, hardcoded, key that is identical
across all installs and
customers. After decryption of this file by the hardcoded AES key
confidential information,
```

such as user passwords are visible in plain text.

```
This implies that knowledge of this hardcoded key allows for the
disclosure of sensitive
information from the configuration files, or that files with different
information can be
```

introduced and are axiomatically trusted by the phone.

```
As this key is static - this includes historic files from any customer
that used this tool.
```

The vendor has fixed this in version 1.2 of the Configuration Encrypt Tool.

========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
1) Upgrade Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool to version 1.2

```
2) Evaluate the impact of the disclosure of any configurations rolled
out with
prior versions of this tool (including, specifically, the leaking of
passwords)
```

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================

```
1) If an upgrade is not an option - as `anyone' can create valid
configuration
files; ensure that affected equipment is unable to reach provisioning
servers.
2) Evaluate the impact of the disclosure of any configurations rolled
out prior
```

to these mitigation steps
