Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool used a single, hardcoded AES key across all installations to encrypt provisioning documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a static, hardcoded AES key for encryption. This key is the same for all users of the tool, making the encryption effectively useless once the key is known.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** The encryption was intended to protect sensitive information in provisioning documents. The hardcoded key allows anyone with knowledge of it to decrypt these documents, exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers with the hardcoded AES key can decrypt configuration files, revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, server hostnames, and caller IDs, stored in plaintext within the encrypted files.
*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Attackers can create modified provisioning documents, encrypt them with the hardcoded key, and introduce them to the phone, potentially leading to unauthorized access or functionality modification on the device.
*   **Historical Data Exposure:** As the key is static, all past configurations encrypted with the vulnerable versions of the tool are vulnerable, creating a large window of potential data exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Key Discovery:** The primary attack vector involves discovering the hardcoded AES key. This could potentially be through reverse engineering or by accessing source code or other leaked resources.
*   **Decryption of Configuration Files:** Once the attacker knows the hardcoded key, they can decrypt any provisioning documents created with the vulnerable tool.
*   **Creation of Malicious Configuration Files:** An attacker can create malicious configuration files, encrypt them with the hardcoded key, and have the phone accept them as legitimate configuration data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the hardcoded AES key:** This is the key requirement for a successful attack.
*   **Access to the encrypted configuration files:** An attacker needs access to the files transferred to Yealink equipment.
*   **Ability to create modified files:** Attackers need to craft their own configuration files for malicious purposes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor has addressed this issue in version 1.2 of the Configuration Encrypt Tool.
*   The vulnerability affects both the AES and older RSA versions of the Yealink Configuration Encrypt Tool (prior to version 1.2).
*   The advisory also emphasizes the need to evaluate the impact of historical configuration files that were encrypted with the tool prior to the fix.
*   Mitigations include updating the tool to version 1.2, or preventing affected devices from reaching the provisioning server if an upgrade is not possible.
