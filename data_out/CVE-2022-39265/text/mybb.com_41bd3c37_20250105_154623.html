[How to verify packages](/download/verifying/)

This version resolves discovered bugs and regressions, and improves compatibility with database engines and recent PHP versions.

Please note that the value of *Additional Parameters for PHP’s mail()* (*Mail Settings*) now only takes effect when saved in the [Configuration File](https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/faq/mail/#additional-parameters-for-phps-mail).

## Upgrading to this Version

To upgrade: copy and overwrite the files, and run the `install/` **upgrade script**.

Before performing any upgrade, remember to **backup** your forum’s files and database and store them safely.

If you have edited core files, including language files, please make sure you make a changelog for these changes so you can make them again (if necessary) once the upgrade is complete.

Follow the [Upgrade Documentation](https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/install/upgrade/) for more detailed instructions.
