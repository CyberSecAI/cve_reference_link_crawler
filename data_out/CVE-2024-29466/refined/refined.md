Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw present in the `FileTransUtil.java` component of the `spring-boot-online-exam` application. Specifically, the `saveUploadedFiles` function within this class is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by writing malicious files to arbitrary locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Path Traversal:** The primary attack vector is through crafting malicious file paths that traverse directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files and control the file names and/or paths used during the upload process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `/backend/src/main/java/lsgwr/exam/utils/FileTransUtil.java: saveUploadedFiles`.
- The affected product is `spring-boot-online-exam` version `v0.9`.
- The issue was reported in [lsgwr/spring-boot-online-exam#62](https://github.com/lsgwr/spring-boot-online-exam/issues/62).
