- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected SIMATIC S7-200 SMART devices use a predictable IP ID sequence number.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of insufficiently random values (CWE-330) leading to predictable IP ID sequence numbers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage the predictable IP ID sequence numbers to launch attacks that could ultimately create a denial of service condition. The vulnerability could also lead to information disclosure, as highlighted by the CVSS vector (C:L).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N). The attacker can be positioned remotely as the attack vector is over a network.
