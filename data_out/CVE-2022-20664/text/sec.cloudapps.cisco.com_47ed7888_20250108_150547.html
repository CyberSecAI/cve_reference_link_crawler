This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization while querying the external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted query through an external authentication web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials from the external authentication server. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid operator-level (or higher) credentials.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esasma-info-dsc-Q9tLuOvM>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager and Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware appliances, if all of the following conditions are met:    + They are running a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software.   + They are configured to use external authentication.   + They are using LDAP as an authentication protocol. **Note:** External authentication is disabled by default.  **Determine whether external authentication is enabled:**    1. Log in to the web management interface of Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager or Cisco ESA.   2. Navigate to **System Administration** > **Users** > **External Authentication** > **Enable External Authentication**.   3. If the green check mark is present, external authentication is enabled. For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Secure Web Appliance, formerly known as Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following table(s), the left column lists major releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  **Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager: [CSCvz40090](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz40090)**       | **AsyncOS Software Release** | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 111 and earlier | Migrate to fixed release. |   | 12 | Migrate to fixed release. |   | 12.8 | Migrate to fixed release. |   | 13.0 | Migrate to Fixed Release. |   | 13.6 | 13.6.2-090 |   | 13.8 | Migrate to fixed release. |   | 14.0 | Migrate to fixed release. |   | 14.1 | 14.1.0-227 |       1.
