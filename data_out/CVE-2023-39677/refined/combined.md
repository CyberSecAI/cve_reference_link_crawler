# PHPInfo Exposure in MyPrestaModules Modules CVE-2023-39677

Two modules that we tested by [MyPrestaModules](https://myprestamodules.com) have a vulnerability where PHPInfo is exposed to an unauthenticated attacker.
The modules SimpleImportProduct and UpdateProducts contain a file called send.php that has the following code snippet:

```
    if ( Tools::getValue('phpinfo') ){
      phpinfo();
      die;
    }

```

This exposes PHPInfo information which is useful to an attacker and it requires no authentication to exploit.
This was reported to MyPrestaModules and a patch was released.
