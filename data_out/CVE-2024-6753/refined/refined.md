Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6753

**Description:** The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an unauthenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `mapTypes` parameter in the `wpw_auto_poster_map_wordpress_post_type` AJAX function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and later executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected page.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other usersâ€™ browsers when they access the affected page, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the site
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need to have any credentials to inject malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
