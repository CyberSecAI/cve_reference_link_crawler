- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause for CVE-2024-26093 is a lack of proper input sanitization, leading to a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires user interaction (UI:R), and a low privileged user (PR:L) can inject the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user and be able to inject a malicious script that gets stored within the application. A victim user then needs to trigger the execution of that script.
