Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a combination of insecure coding practices in the `changepwd.cgi` binary which is part of the RIGOL oscilloscope's web interface. Specifically:

1.  **Command Injection via `system()`:** The `changepwd.cgi` script uses `sprintf` to build a shell command string that includes user-provided input, and then executes it via `system()`. This allows for arbitrary command injection.
2.  **Authentication Bypass via `strncmp()`:** The script uses `strncmp()` to compare the provided old password with the stored password. However, it uses the length of the user-provided string, and an empty string has a length of zero. A `strncmp` with a length of zero will always return 0 indicating a match regardless of the stored password allowing to bypass the authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The use of `system()` with unsanitized user input allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The misuse of `strncmp()` allows attackers to bypass password checks by submitting an empty string as the old password.
*   **Cleartext Password Storage:** The device stores the user password in cleartext within the `/rigol/data/user.conf` file.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation and sanitization for user-supplied parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve unauthenticated RCE on the RIGOL oscilloscope by sending a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With RCE, an attacker can gain full control of the device, potentially leading to data theft, device manipulation, or the use of the device as a foothold into the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through sending a malicious HTTP request to the `changepwd.cgi` endpoint on the web server hosted by the oscilloscope.
*   **Network Exposure:** The vulnerability is exposed via the web interface. Therefore, the device must be connected to a network that is accessible to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the RIGOL oscilloscope's web interface.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a HTTP request. No authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
*   The device uses an ARM Linux system.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `changepwd.cgi` binary.
*   The vulnerability was found on a RIGOL MSO5000 oscilloscope.
*   The author of the write-up attempted to contact RIGOL to report the vulnerability but received little to no response.
*   The firmware file is unencrypted.
*   The default password for the web interface is `rigol`.
*   The writeup also mentions that the same vulnerability was reported to the vendor in 2021 and not addressed.
