Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** A stack-based buffer overflow in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function within the `httpd` binary of certain Tenda routers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` to copy the user-provided `ssid` parameter into stack-based buffers (`acStack_d7` and `acStack_97`) without any length checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or achieve remote code execution (RCE) by overflowing the buffer.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the `/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint, where the `ssid` parameter is set to an overly long string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected router's web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable function is located at `/bin/httpd`.
*   The content explicitly identifies vulnerable Tenda router versions:
    *   F1203 V2.0.1.6
    *   FH1203 V2.0.1.6
    *   FH1205 V2.0.0.7(775)
*   The content includes a visual representation of the vulnerable code.

This information aligns with a typical stack-based buffer overflow scenario, with the added detail of the specific vulnerable function, affected parameters and device versions.
