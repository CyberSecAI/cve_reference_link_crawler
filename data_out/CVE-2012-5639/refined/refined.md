Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-5639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The core issue is the automatic opening of embedded content (both internal and external) by LibreOffice and OpenOffice without a proper warning or the ability to disable this behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of User Warning:** The software does not adequately warn users when a document contains embedded content that will be automatically loaded.
- **No Option to Disable:** There is no straightforward way to disable the automatic loading of embedded content or configure the software to prompt before loading such content.
- **Poor UI:** Even when a prompt is displayed for local file inclusion, it doesn't provide sufficient details about what is being loaded, potentially leading users to blindly click through warnings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Malicious documents could include embedded references to sensitive files (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`), which could be automatically opened and potentially exposed if the document is shared or converted (e.g. to PDF).
- **Remote Exploitation:**  Attackers can embed links to remote resources that could be used to trigger other vulnerabilities in the software, libraries it uses (e.g., libpng), or even bypass virus scanners.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Embedding a large number of network requests could lead to a DoS condition by overwhelming the network resources or the application itself.
- **Tracking Behavior:**  Embedded content could be used for tracking purposes without the user's knowledge.
- **Malware Delivery:** Attackers can embed malicious files that can be executed by the user after being downloaded/included.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Document Files:**  The primary attack vector is through specially crafted document files (e.g., ODT files) that contain embedded references to local or remote content.
- **File Conversion:** When converting the document (e.g., to PDF), embedded data might be copied to the converted file, leading to further exposure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Document Creation:** Attackers need to be able to create or modify document files to include the malicious embedded content.
- **Distribution:**  Attackers need to distribute the malicious files to target users.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue affects both LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice.
- The vulnerability was initially reported publicly by Timo Warns.
- Red Hat assigned the CVE-2012-5639 to track this issue.
- There have been discussions about extending existing security options to address this, including adding warnings for saving files/creating PDFs if external data will be saved or printed. However, there is no straightforward solution.
- The default behavior of allowing links to local resources is considered necessary for core functionality.
- Debian considers this a minor issue and marked it as unimportant.
