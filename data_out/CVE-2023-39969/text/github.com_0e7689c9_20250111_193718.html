### @woodruffw **[woodruffw](/woodruffw)** commented [Jul 28, 2023](#issue-1827096943)

This reverts commit [d16e9ec](https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/commit/d16e9ec2b4d54c1333137ae34f011e9eb3e0b962).

CC [@pkdawson](https://github.com/pkdawson): This is going to revert your work in [#62](https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/pull/62) due to some issues around [Authenticode stuffing](https://vcsjones.dev/authenticode-stuffing-tricks/) that were recently brought to our attention.

My plan is to re-merge your fix, tweaked to perform the section sorting the way we originally did it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Testing this branch, I see a regression for [#59](https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/issues/59), where svcli shows the same incorrect calculated checksum for the linked Firefox installer.  I don't understand this issue well enough to give useful input, but for what it's worth, [CryptQueryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptqueryobject) fails to find an embedded signature in `YourPhone.exe` (error code `CRYPT_E_NO_MATCH`). This API does not check the Authenticode hash.  signtool reports the same:  ``` SignTool Error: File not valid: YourPhone.exe SignTool Error: No signature found.  ``` |

Sort of -- part of this is covered by the section iteration, but not all of it (which is why we've regressed on some PEs, as noted in [#84 (comment)](https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/pull/84#issuecomment-1660794391)).

I need to think more about an appropriate way to do this -- we need to perform the sorted section iteration *and* hash everything after the sections.
