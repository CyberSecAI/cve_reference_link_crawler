## [Contact Form 7 5.8.4](https://contactform7.com/2023/11/30/contact-form-7-584/)

[November 30, 2023](https://contactform7.com/2023/11/30/contact-form-7-584/) [Takayuki Miyoshi](https://contactform7.com/author/miyoshi/)

Contact Form 7 version 5.8.4 is now available. This minor update release addresses a medium severity security issue recently reported.

A vulnerability related to file uploading was [reported](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/contact-form-7/contact-form-7-583-authenticated-editor-arbitrary-file-upload) by Wordfence vulnerability researcher István Márton. To avoid the security risk, upgrade Contact Form 7 to 5.8.4 or later as soon as possible.

In the report it is pointed out that an add-on plugin called “Redirection for Contact Form 7” deliberately disables the safety mechanism of Contact Form 7, and, as a result, amplifies the risk of the vulnerability. Considering the maliciousness that this fact implies, and the [prominent number of vulnerabilities](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/wpcf7-redirect) reported about this plugin in the past, we strongly recommend you stop using the “Redirection for Contact Form 7” ([wpcf7-redirect](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcf7-redirect/)) plugin.

**Requires:** WordPress 6.2 or higher

**Tested up to:** WordPress 6.4.1
