- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly handle log rotation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Resource exhaustion due to improper log rotation handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition through resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access, exploiting the improper log rotation handling mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to reach the affected application through the network but does not need any authentication or special privileges.
