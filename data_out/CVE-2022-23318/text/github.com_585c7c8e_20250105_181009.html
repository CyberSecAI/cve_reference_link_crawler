| Hello [@ganaware](https://github.com/ganaware), as discussed earlier: I have compiled pcf2bdf with address sanitization and fuzz-tested inputs with `AFL`. The file attached causes a memory access violation. The actual input file is stored within the zipped folder attached.  Input: `./pcf2bdf heap_overflow_read_40b`  Output:  ``` gzip: heap_overflow_read_40b: unexpected end of file ================================================================= ==5565==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000050 at pc 0x0000004095b0 bp 0x7fffff5362b0 sp 0x7fffff5362a0 READ of size 40 at 0x602000000050 thread T0     #0 0x4095af in main /home/ec2-user/pcf2bdf_research/pcf2bdf.cc:852     #1 0x7f7a5a1c6139 in __libc_start_main (/lib64/libc.so.6+0x21139)     #2 0x409b49 in _start (/home/ec2-user/pcf2bdf_research/with_asan/pcf2bdf+0x409b49)  0x602000000051 is located 0 bytes to the right of 1-byte region [0x602000000050,0x602000000051) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7f7a5af01f41 in operator new[](unsigned long) (/lib64/libasan.so.4+0xd9f41)     #1 0x4074a4 in main /home/ec2-user/pcf2bdf_research/pcf2bdf.cc:829  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /home/ec2-user/pcf2bdf_research/pcf2bdf.cc:852 in main Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c047fff7fb0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fc0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fd0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7fe0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c047fff7ff0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c047fff8000: fa fa 01 fa fa fa 01 fa fa fa[01]fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8010: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8020: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8040: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c047fff8050: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07   Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==5565==ABORTING  ```  [heap\_overflow\_read\_40b.zip](https://github.com/ganaware/pcf2bdf/files/7846643/heap_overflow_read_40b.zip) |
