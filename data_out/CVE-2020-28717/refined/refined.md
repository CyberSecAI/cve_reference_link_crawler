Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-28717:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `demo.jsp` file of the `kindeditor` project.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The `demo.jsp` file is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being included in the HTML output.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "content1" parameter. When the server processes this crafted request and sends the HTML response to the user, the injected JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the webpage.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the `demo.jsp` file. The attacker needs to manipulate the "content1" parameter within the request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server hosting `kindeditor`. They need to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `content1` and be able to modify it before sending it to the server.

**Technical Details:**
The provided text describes a proof-of-concept (PoC) for this vulnerability:
1.  The user interacts with the application by clicking on "提交内容" (Submit Content).
2.  The attacker intercepts the HTTP request.
3.  The attacker modifies the value of the `content1` parameter to include malicious JavaScript code such as `<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`.
4.  The attacker forwards the modified request to the server.
5.  The server processes this request without proper sanitization and the response includes the injected JavaScript.
6.  The user's browser executes the injected script, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability, in this case by displaying an alert box with `/XSS/`.
