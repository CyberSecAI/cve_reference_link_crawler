- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization of Java objects from Hadoop or Spark configuration properties. These properties could be modified by authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe deserialization of Java objects.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: By modifying Hadoop or Spark configuration properties, an attacker can inject malicious serialized Java objects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to modify Hadoop or Spark configuration properties.
