{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TSSServiSign component's registry writing function does not filter or validate input parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can write arbitrary values to the registry without requiring any privileges and perform a hijack attack to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote."
