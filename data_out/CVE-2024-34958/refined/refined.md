The provided content relates to CVE-2024-34958.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the `banner_deal.php?mudi=add` component of the idccms V1.35 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- The application does not properly validate the origin of the requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request to `banner_deal.php?mudi=add`.
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized banner modifications.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates adding or changing banner configurations, including image, URL, rank, and state.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page, likely hosted on a different domain than the target application.
- This page contains a form that submits a POST request to the vulnerable `banner_deal.php?mudi=add` endpoint.
- The victim user, while logged into the target application, is lured into visiting the attacker-controlled malicious page.
- The malicious page submits the forged request to the application, impersonating the authenticated user, leading to unauthorized actions on the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create and host a web page.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`banner_deal.php?mudi=add`) and the required parameters for the POST request.
- The attacker needs to entice an authenticated user of idccms to visit the crafted page.
- No special privileges within the application are needed.
