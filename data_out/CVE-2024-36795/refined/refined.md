Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-36795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insecure permissions settings within the firmware of the Netgear WNR614 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure permissions allow access to URLs and directories embedded within the router's firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as mail server credentials that are stored unencrypted.
- Attackers can control router settings.
- The unencrypted storage of sensitive information increases the risk of unauthorized network access and compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
