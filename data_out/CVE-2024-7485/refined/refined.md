- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'page' parameter in the 'UserWebStat' AJAX function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions within the user's session or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The 'page' parameter within the 'UserWebStat' AJAX function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attacker, able to send requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
