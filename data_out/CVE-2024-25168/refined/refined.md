- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `$` placeholder symbol in the `dataScope` parameter of the `/system/role/list` interface, which allows for direct SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the `dataScope` parameter of the `/system/role/list` interface. The application is using a vulnerable placeholder mechanism that allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to steal sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal information, business data) or potentially control the server. Attackers can also inject operating system commands or code directly into the backend server, leading to complete control of the backend system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `/system/role/list` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `params[dataScope]` parameter to include malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server and be able to modify the `dataScope` parameter to include SQL injection payloads. No authentication is explicitly mentioned, so the attacker may be an unauthenticated user.
