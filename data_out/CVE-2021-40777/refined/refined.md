- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of memory location after the end of a buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-788).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access (AV:L), low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file that will trigger the vulnerability.
