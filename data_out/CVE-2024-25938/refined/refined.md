- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the way Foxit Reader handles a Barcode object. Specifically, the `deletePages()` function frees objects associated with a page, including the `CBF_Widget` (Barcode) object. Subsequently, the freed Barcode object is accessed without validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  Opening a malicious PDF file with specially crafted Javascript.
    -  Visiting a malicious website if the browser plugin extension for Foxit Reader is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file with JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PDF. For web-based exploitation, they need to host the malicious content and have the victim visit that site with the browser plugin extension enabled.
