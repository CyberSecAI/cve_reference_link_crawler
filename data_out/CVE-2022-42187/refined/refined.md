Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `problem_judge.php` file. Specifically, the script echoes user-controlled data (`input_text` and `source`) directly into the HTML output without encoding or sanitizing them. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application takes user-provided input and reflects it back to the user's browser without proper sanitization, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the web page which will then be executed within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker could leverage the XSS to perform administrative actions on their behalf, potentially gaining full control of the application. This is evident in the example provided where an attacker uses the XSS to add a user to the administrator group.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify displayed content or submit malicious data to the application.

**Attack vectors:**

- **POST request injection:** The attacker injects malicious Javascript via the `input_text` field in a POST request to `submit.php` or similar.
- **Malicious links:**  An attacker can craft malicious links that, when clicked by an administrator, automatically send a POST request containing a malicious `input_text` to `problem_judge.php`.
- **Other files**: As pointed out, other files such as `/swadmin/problem_judge.php` are also vulnerable to the same kind of XSS attack, specifically when handling `source` and `input_text`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to make HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`submit.php` or directly to `problem_judge.php`).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting the malicious POST request with a specific `sid` value.
- **Basic Understanding of Javascript and HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the XSS payload.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided content suggests that the vulnerability exists in multiple files, specifically mentioning `problem_judge.php` under both `/admin/` and `/swadmin/` directories.
- The vulnerability was fixed by encoding the output, as can be seen in the linked commit `c15d370`.
- The attacker was able to use a crafted script to add an administrative user to the system.
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of user-provided text before being displayed on the page.
