**Description**

[#23514](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/23514) added `az.ps1` so that when Azure CLI is invoked in PowerShell, `az.ps1` is called instead of `az.cmd`.

However, this change introduced 5 new issues:

**Arguments**

* [Cannot pass PowerShell array as `$mylist` to Azure CLI¬†#23797](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23797): PowerShell array `$mylist` is splatted when calling `.cmd`, but not when calling `.ps1`. Instead, the array is concatenated as a single string.
* [Argument passthrough `--` stops working in PowerShell since 2.40.0¬†#24034](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24034): PowerShell doesn't include `--` in `$args`
* [PowerShell stop-parsing token `--%` stops working since Azure CLI 2.40.0¬†#24114](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24114): `--%` only works for native executable, but not `.ps1` script.

**`stdin`**

* [Azure CLI 2.40.0 breaks stdin passing on PowerShell¬†#23883](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23883): When calling `.ps1`, PowerShell doesn't automatically connect `stdin` to pipeline.

**Exit code**

* [az command returns 0 when failing¬†#23880](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23880): Exit code is not surfaced when `pwsh.exe` calling `.ps1` calling `.exe`

**Shell interaction**

* [`az` can't be invoked by `Start-Process` since 2.40.0¬†#24005](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24005): `.cmd` can be invoked by `Start-Process`, but `.ps1` cannot.

This PR reverts the change by renaming `az.ps1` to `azps.ps1` so that users can still use the `.ps1` entry script if they want, but by default, when calling `az`, `az.cmd` will be called as before.

We will work with PowerShell team to see how to fix these issues.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Is there a problem with leaving it `az.ps1`? Is the customer able to specify their entry script by the extension?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is there a problem with leaving it `az.ps1`?  Yes. If we don't rename `az.ps1`, it will be the default script when `az` is called from PowerShell, overriding `az.cmd`.  Is the customer able to specify their entry script by the extension?  They can. |
