## Context

Fix [#20972](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/20972)

If an argument contains special characters like `|` and `&`, even though the character is double quoted, it still gets executed. This is because PowerShell launches `cmd.exe` to execute `az.cmd` script. Double quotes are parsed by PowerShell so not passed to `cmd.exe` during this process. `cmd.exe` sees the raw `|` and `&` and executes them.

However, when `az.cmd` is invoked from `cmd.exe` (Command Prompt), it is launched in-process, and double quotes are preserved, leading to inconsistent behavior between `cmd.exe` and PowerShell.

## Change

This PR adds `az.ps1` entry script for PowerShell, so that PowerShell can natively execute `az.ps1` and no longer launches `cmd.exe` to execute `az.cmd`.

Since PowerShell 7.3, double quotes are now preserved correctly when calling a native executable ([PowerShell/PowerShell#1995 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1995#issuecomment-1211457683)), thus fixing [#15529](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/15529).

## Testing Guide

```
az --debug '"ab"'
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', '"ab"']

az --debug "a|b"
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a|b']

az --debug "a&b"
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a&b']

```

This doesn't work correctly with WinPS 5.1, right? Unfortunately the case of `az '{"test":1}'` by the time the `$args` is processed, you would get `{test:1}` on any PS older than 7.3 (which makes it no longer valid JSON), and there's no way to know what the original intent. So perhaps the best thing is to iterate through `$args` and if `|` or `&` is found, throw an error that it would only work with 7.3+?

Tested in Windows PowerShell 5.1, and indeed double quotes are lost, but luckily `|` or `&` isn't causing any problems to us. :)

```
> az2 --debug "a|b" "a&b" '"ab"'
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a|b', 'a&b', 'ab']

```

| By the way, I am playing around by calling `cmd.exe` (<https://ss64.com/nt/cmd.html>) myself from Command Prompt and it looks like it has some weird behavior that I need to add extra double quotes (denoted by `^`):  According to <https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-esc.html>  To launch a batch script with spaces in the script Path and other parameters, all requiring quotes:  ``` CMD /k ""c:\batch files\test.cmd" "Parameter 1 with space" "Parameter2 with space""        ^                                                                          ^  ```  My testing:  `D:\test.cmd` contains  ``` @echo %*  ```  ``` D:\>cmd /c "D:\test.cmd" "parameter1 parameter2" 'D:\test.cmd" "parameter1' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  D:\>cmd /c ""D:\test.cmd" "parameter1 parameter2"" "parameter1 parameter2"  ```  While in Bash  `/home/user2/test.sh` contains  ``` echo "$@"  ```  ``` user2@DESKTOP-A79F1:~$ bash "/home/user2/test.sh" "parameter1 parameter2" parameter1 parameter2 user2@DESKTOP-A79F1:~$ bash ""/home/user2/test.sh" "parameter1 parameter2"" bash: /home/user2/test.sh parameter1: No such file or directory  ```  No weird outer double quotes are needed. |

| I also found another weird PowerShell behavior while writing this PR - PowerShell sometimes even depends on the space location to determine the behavior:  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\"c' ['-c', '"a', 'b"c'] > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"ab\" c' ['-c', '"ab" c']  ```  Also consider these commands:  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '""a b""' ['-c', '"a b"'] > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\"' ['-c', '"a', 'b"']  ```  They should be grammatically equivalent, as in Win32 API within double quotes, `""` and `\"` both mean literal double quote sign. However, they are not, because in the second example, PowerShell somehow recognizes double quotes and thinks space is not “on the root level of the string”, so doesn’t surround the argument with double quotes when passing it to `python.exe`, making the argument split.  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\" ' ['-c', '"a b" ']  ```  In the above example, I put an extra space “on the root level” and PowerShell passed the arguments double-quoted-ly to `python.exe`. |

There is one problem with `az.ps1` for `pip`.

* ESRP code-sign was executed on Azure DevOps's Windows agent. When `git` checks out the source code on Windows, the end of line sequence is `CRLF` (`\r\n`). This is the default of Windows `git`:

  [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4003950/185730246-608b7fcd-fa45-42fa-88bb-eed867b487af.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4003950/185730246-608b7fcd-fa45-42fa-88bb-eed867b487af.png)

  so the signature was generated for the `CRLF` version of `az.ps1`.
* However, wheels are built on Linux agent, converting `az.ps1`'s end of line sequence to `LF` (`\n`).
* Even when installing with `pip -e`, `pip` converts `CRLF` to `LF` (for simplicity I guess).

That is, on Windows,

* `az.ps1` in source code contains `CRLF`
* `az.ps1` installed in `Scripts` folder contains `LF`

Since the signature was generated for the `CRLF` version of `az.ps1`, but the installed `az.ps1` is `LF` version, the signature doesn't match the file content.

Even if we ESRP code sign the `LF` version, `az.ps1` will be checked out as `CRLF` in the source code, still making the signature mismatch. That is, the signature will never match the file content of both `az.ps1`s - one `az.ps1`'s signature must be out of place.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hello everyone, could please explain how I should run scripts right now I am a little bit confused, on azure DevOps I have a script that had run az in the next way:  `Start-Process "az" -ArgumentList $azArgs -NoNewWindow -Wait` azArgs is a commend to set some settings that is. and currently I see an error : *Start-Process : This command cannot be run due to the error: %1 is not a valid Win32 application* how do I need to change it to make it work after this fix? Should I just remove Start-Process ? |
