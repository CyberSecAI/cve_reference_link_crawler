# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') in Azure CLI

Critical

[chasewilson](/chasewilson)
published
GHSA-47xc-9rr2-q7p4
Oct 24, 2022

## Package

Azure CLI
(Windows)

## Affected versions

< 2.40.0

## Patched versions

>= 2.40.0

## Description

# Description

In versions previous to 2.40.0, Azure CLI contains a vulnerability for potential code injection. Critical scenarios are where a hosting machine runs an Azure CLI command where parameter values have been provided by an external source.

For example: Application X is a web application with a feature that allows users to create Secrets in an Azure KeyVault. Instead of constructing API calls based on user input, Application X uses Azure CLI commands to create the secrets. Application X has input fields presented to the user and the Azure CLI command parameter values are filled based on the user input fields. This input, when formed correctly, could potentially be run as system commands. Below is an example of the resulting Azure CLI command run on the web app's hosting machine.

```
az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value "abc123|whoami"
```

The above command could potentially run the `whoami` command on the hosting machine.

Interactive, in-terminal use and automation/pipeline scenarios have not been identified as critical risk scenarios.

## Code injection prerequisites

The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows machine ***and*** with any version of PowerShell \*\**and*\*\*when the parameter value contains the `&` or `|` symbols. If any of these prerequisites are not met, this vulnerability is not applicable.

### 1. The command has to be run on Windows

The Azure CLI has an entry script that, when run on Windows, calls cmd.exe to then call Python. This leads into the next prerequisite.

### 2. The command has to be executed by PowerShell.

PowerShell has input parsing designs that strip out the quotation marks of input with the expectation that it will be taken as a string. When used in a PowerShell environment, the command is input like the above command. However, when it passes through PowerShell into cmd.exe, it looks like the following.

```
az keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value abc123|whoami
```

This leads to the 3rd prerequisite as it won’t just try to run any parameter value as a command.

### 3. The parameter value has to contain a `&` or `|` symbols

In cmd.exe, the `&` and `|` symbols invoke command execution. When a string containing this symbols is passed directly to cmd.exe, quotes are kept and command execution is invoked. However, When a string is passed into PowerShell, the quotes are stripped and passed into cmd.exe making it open to execution.

So, in the `keyvault` example above, the `abc123` portion of the value will be accepted correctly but the value after the `|` symbol will be interpreted as a command.

# Impact

## Code injection

As mentioned in the above scenario where the value is being provided by and outside source to run an Azure CLI command, system commands or even scripts could be run on a hosting machine.

# Patches

Upgrade to Azure CLI 2.40.0 or greater.

As of Azure CLI 2.40.0, a new .ps1 entry script is used as the entry point to call Python rather than cmd.exe. This removes the opportunity for cmd.exe to interpret input as a command invocation. Using this approach has introduced new issues however that you can read about in the "More information" section.

Upgrade to 2.41.0 or greater and manually call the azps.ps1 entry script in identified critical scenarios.

In Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have [reverted back](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015) to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin\azps.ps1 keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value "abc123|whoami"
```
## More information

### PowerShell Parsing with Azure CLI

PowerShell’s input parsing design has caused regressions and issues in Azure CLI’s behavior resulting in broken scripts and pipelines. Below are the known issues and links to GitHub issues. This should not be taken as a complete list since these are ***only the reported*** issues. Users should verify command effectiveness before use in production environments.

1. [PowerShell arrays can't be passed to Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23797)
2. [Argument passthrough token (`--`) doesn't work with Azure CLI in PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24034)
3. [Stop parsing token (`--%`) no longer works with Azure CLI in PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24114)
4. [stdin passing is interrupted for Azure CLI in PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/2388)
5. [Azure CLI returns 0 when failing in PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23880)
6. [Azure CLI can no longer be invoked by `Start-Process`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015)

To avoid these breaking changes, in Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have [reverted back](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015) to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.

> 🗒️ The .ps1 entry script is only required for similarly identified scenarios like the example above. Interactive use and automation scenarios have not been identified as high risk.

If the azps.ps1 script is needed, you can call it like this:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin\azps.ps1 vm create
```

The Azure CLI team is still considering further mitigations to remove the vulnerability altogether. Please check back with this CVE in the future for any further updates.

## Context

Fix [#20972](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/20972)

If an argument contains special characters like `|` and `&`, even though the character is double quoted, it still gets executed. This is because PowerShell launches `cmd.exe` to execute `az.cmd` script. Double quotes are parsed by PowerShell so not passed to `cmd.exe` during this process. `cmd.exe` sees the raw `|` and `&` and executes them.

However, when `az.cmd` is invoked from `cmd.exe` (Command Prompt), it is launched in-process, and double quotes are preserved, leading to inconsistent behavior between `cmd.exe` and PowerShell.

## Change

This PR adds `az.ps1` entry script for PowerShell, so that PowerShell can natively execute `az.ps1` and no longer launches `cmd.exe` to execute `az.cmd`.

Since PowerShell 7.3, double quotes are now preserved correctly when calling a native executable ([PowerShell/PowerShell#1995 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1995#issuecomment-1211457683)), thus fixing [#15529](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/15529).

## Testing Guide

```
az --debug '"ab"'
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', '"ab"']

az --debug "a|b"
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a|b']

az --debug "a&b"
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a&b']

```

This doesn't work correctly with WinPS 5.1, right? Unfortunately the case of `az '{"test":1}'` by the time the `$args` is processed, you would get `{test:1}` on any PS older than 7.3 (which makes it no longer valid JSON), and there's no way to know what the original intent. So perhaps the best thing is to iterate through `$args` and if `|` or `&` is found, throw an error that it would only work with 7.3+?

Tested in Windows PowerShell 5.1, and indeed double quotes are lost, but luckily `|` or `&` isn't causing any problems to us. :)

```
> az2 --debug "a|b" "a&b" '"ab"'
cli.knack.cli: Command arguments: ['--debug', 'a|b', 'a&b', 'ab']

| By the way, I am playing around by calling `cmd.exe` (<https://ss64.com/nt/cmd.html>) myself from Command Prompt and it looks like it has some weird behavior that I need to add extra double quotes (denoted by `^`):  According to <https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-esc.html>  To launch a batch script with spaces in the script Path and other parameters, all requiring quotes:  ``` CMD /k ""c:\batch files\test.cmd" "Parameter 1 with space" "Parameter2 with space""        ^                                                                          ^  ```  My testing:  `D:\test.cmd` contains  ``` @echo %*  ```  ``` D:\>cmd /c "D:\test.cmd" "parameter1 parameter2" 'D:\test.cmd" "parameter1' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  D:\>cmd /c ""D:\test.cmd" "parameter1 parameter2"" "parameter1 parameter2"  ```  While in Bash  `/home/user2/test.sh` contains  ``` echo "$@"  ```  ``` user2@DESKTOP-A79F1:~$ bash "/home/user2/test.sh" "parameter1 parameter2" parameter1 parameter2 user2@DESKTOP-A79F1:~$ bash ""/home/user2/test.sh" "parameter1 parameter2"" bash: /home/user2/test.sh parameter1: No such file or directory  ```  No weird outer double quotes are needed. |

### **[jiasli](/jiasli)** commented [Aug 20, 2022](#issuecomment-1221198685)

| I also found another weird PowerShell behavior while writing this PR - PowerShell sometimes even depends on the space location to determine the behavior:  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\"c' ['-c', '"a', 'b"c'] > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"ab\" c' ['-c', '"ab" c']  ```  Also consider these commands:  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '""a b""' ['-c', '"a b"'] > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\"' ['-c', '"a', 'b"']  ```  They should be grammatically equivalent, as in Win32 API within double quotes, `""` and `\"` both mean literal double quote sign. However, they are not, because in the second example, PowerShell somehow recognizes double quotes and thinks space is not “on the root level of the string”, so doesn’t surround the argument with double quotes when passing it to `python.exe`, making the argument split.  ``` > python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)" '\"a b\" ' ['-c', '"a b" ']  ```  In the above example, I put an extra space “on the root level” and PowerShell passed the arguments double-quoted-ly to `python.exe`. |

There is one problem with `az.ps1` for `pip`.

* ESRP code-sign was executed on Azure DevOps's Windows agent. When `git` checks out the source code on Windows, the end of line sequence is `CRLF` (`\r\n`). This is the default of Windows `git`:

  [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4003950/185730246-608b7fcd-fa45-42fa-88bb-eed867b487af.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4003950/185730246-608b7fcd-fa45-42fa-88bb-eed867b487af.png)

  so the signature was generated for the `CRLF` version of `az.ps1`.
* However, wheels are built on Linux agent, converting `az.ps1`'s end of line sequence to `LF` (`\n`).
* Even when installing with `pip -e`, `pip` converts `CRLF` to `LF` (for simplicity I guess).

That is, on Windows,

* `az.ps1` in source code contains `CRLF`
* `az.ps1` installed in `Scripts` folder contains `LF`

Since the signature was generated for the `CRLF` version of `az.ps1`, but the installed `az.ps1` is `LF` version, the signature doesn't match the file content.

Even if we ESRP code sign the `LF` version, `az.ps1` will be checked out as `CRLF` in the source code, still making the signature mismatch. That is, the signature will never match the file content of both `az.ps1`s - one `az.ps1`'s signature must be out of place.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hello everyone, could please explain how I should run scripts right now I am a little bit confused, on azure DevOps I have a script that had run az in the next way:  `Start-Process "az" -ArgumentList $azArgs -NoNewWindow -Wait` azArgs is a commend to set some settings that is. and currently I see an error : *Start-Process : This command cannot be run due to the error: %1 is not a valid Win32 application* how do I need to change it to make it work after this fix? Should I just remove Start-Process ? |

**Description**

[#23514](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/23514) added `az.ps1` so that when Azure CLI is invoked in PowerShell, `az.ps1` is called instead of `az.cmd`.

However, this change introduced 5 new issues:

**Arguments**

* [Cannot pass PowerShell array as `$mylist` to Azure CLI #23797](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23797): PowerShell array `$mylist` is splatted when calling `.cmd`, but not when calling `.ps1`. Instead, the array is concatenated as a single string.
* [Argument passthrough `--` stops working in PowerShell since 2.40.0 #24034](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24034): PowerShell doesn't include `--` in `$args`
* [PowerShell stop-parsing token `--%` stops working since Azure CLI 2.40.0 #24114](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24114): `--%` only works for native executable, but not `.ps1` script.

**`stdin`**

* [Azure CLI 2.40.0 breaks stdin passing on PowerShell #23883](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23883): When calling `.ps1`, PowerShell doesn't automatically connect `stdin` to pipeline.

**Exit code**

* [az command returns 0 when failing #23880](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23880): Exit code is not surfaced when `pwsh.exe` calling `.ps1` calling `.exe`

**Shell interaction**

* [`az` can't be invoked by `Start-Process` since 2.40.0 #24005](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24005): `.cmd` can be invoked by `Start-Process`, but `.ps1` cannot.

This PR reverts the change by renaming `az.ps1` to `azps.ps1` so that users can still use the `.ps1` entry script if they want, but by default, when calling `az`, `az.cmd` will be called as before.

We will work with PowerShell team to see how to fix these issues.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Is there a problem with leaving it `az.ps1`? Is the customer able to specify their entry script by the extension?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is there a problem with leaving it `az.ps1`?  Yes. If we don't rename `az.ps1`, it will be the default script when `az` is called from PowerShell, overriding `az.cmd`.  Is the customer able to specify their entry script by the extension?  They can. |
