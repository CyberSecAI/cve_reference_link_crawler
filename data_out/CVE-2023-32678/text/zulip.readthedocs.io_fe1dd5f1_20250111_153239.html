# Version history[](#version-history "Link to this heading")

This page contains the release history for the Zulip server. See also the
[Zulip release lifecycle](release-lifecycle.html).

## Zulip Server 10.x series (development)[](#zulip-server-10-x-series-development "Link to this heading")

This section is an incomplete draft of the release notes for the next
major release, and is only updated occasionally. See the [commit
log](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commits/main) for an up-to-date list of all changes.

### Zulip Server 10.0[](#zulip-server-10-0 "Link to this heading")

*Unreleased*

#### Highlights[](#highlights "Link to this heading")

* Redesigned the left sidebar visually, adding convenient “New topic”
  and “New direct message” buttons.
* Redesigned the right sidebar buddy list visually, adding a new “THIS
  CONVERSATION” section showing just the users who’ve participated
  recently in the currently viewed conversation, and improving its
  filtering component.
* User groups are now much more powerful, supporting subgroups and
  with new permissions settings for who can administer the group, join
  it, or edit its membership. Permission for creating new groups is
  now separate from permission to administer all groups.
* Most permissions settings in Zulip have been reimplemented with a
  new flexible system based on groups, and can have a value of any
  combination of roles, groups, and individual users. Groups can be
  nested as subgroups of other groups. Groups are now deactivated,
  rather than being fully deleted, so Zulip’s audit logs still
  maintain a complete history of permissions changes.
* Added a right sidebar buddy list style option showing user avatars,
  designed for smaller organizations.
* Changes the semantics for when messages are marked as read when
  scrolling the blue selection box past them and the bottom of the
  feed is not visible to avoid shifting one’s place when briefly
  visiting a conversation.
* Reworked the “archive channel” functionality to not mutate their
  names or make content inaccessible, with a view towards supporting
  unarchiving channels.
* Significantly improved the performance of rendering messages in the
  web application, and optimized common views to load near-instantly,
  without making any network requests.
* Added a new syntax for entering a direct link to a message in the
  compose box; message links pasted in the compose box are
  automatically converted into this syntax. (The original URL is
  accessible via browser undo or plain-text paste).
* Added support for uploading arbitrarily large files using the TUS
  chunked-upload protocol. The existing `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` setting
  will need to updated for most self-hosted installations; see the
  upgrade notes below.

#### Full feature changelog[](#full-feature-changelog "Link to this heading")

* Redesigned icons for bots, copying, and various other actions.
* Added support for syncing user roles with the SCIM integration.
* Added support for configuring certain custom profile fields to not
  be editable by the user, for fields that are maintained by
  administrators or synced from a third-party service.
* Added support for personal Microsoft accounts in the EntraID/AzureAD
  authentication backend.
* Added `*` keyboard shortcut for navigating to starred messages view.
* Added UI support for data exports with member consent.
* Added new prompt when editing a message to remove the last reference
  to a previously uploaded file.
* Added the “Enter sends” setting to the Preferences settings
  panel. Previously, it was only accessible in the compose area.
* Added a new channel details menu when clicking channel pills.
* Added live-update support to reactions, starred messages, followed
  topics, and similar views that previously did not support it.
* Added a clarifying modal the first time a user tries to resolve a
  topic, confirming that they understand it’s resolved for everyone.
* Added informative new error output when attempting to load a data
  export into a Zulip server running a different server version.
* Added a new API endpoint for bulk-fetching messages by ID. Improved
  API support for fetching users by email address.
* Added API support for changing another user’s email address, with a
  `can_change_user_emails` administrative permission issued via
  management shell.
* Clicking on the channel name while viewing a topic in a channel is
  now another way to reach the Channel Feed for that channel.
* New Airbyte integration. Updated GitHub, GitLab, GoCD, Linear, and
  NewRelic integrations. Removed the OpsBeat integration as the
  product is defunct.
* The GitHub webhook now has a flag to filter activity from private
  repositories.
* The `ignore_pull_requests` flag for the Travis CI integration was
  removed in favor of Zulip’s generic event-filtering support.
* System bot avatars are now shipped with the server, instead of
  relying on Gravatar.
* Deactivated users and bot users are now displayed more consistently
  across the UI.
* Search results now show the full date on every result.
* The year is now always displayed on the first recipient/date bar
  entering the current year (Previously, one might see “June 12, 2022”
  followed by “July 15” and incorrectly think the latter was July 15, 2022).
* Improved hotkey documentation for macOS users with non-Mac keyboards.
* Improved search keyboard UI in several subtle ways.
* Improved how guest users are present in the invitation UI.
* Improved bottom-of-feed bookends for unsubscribed channels.
* Fixed a nasty bug where messages could be marked as read when they
  arrived onscreen at an unattended computer with Zulip focused.
* Fixed several bugs involving clicking on message feed elements like
  mentions in drafts, scheduled messages, and preview send components.
* Fixed a line-wrapping bug where punctuation could weirdly wrap to
  the next line after mentions or global times.
* Fixed error handling of 502s caused by timeouts.
* Fixed several bugs involving deactivated users’ group membership.
* Fixed several bugs in the logical data import/export system.
* Fixed several subtle race bugs involving local echo of sent messages.
* Fixed buggy URL-escaping of filenames in tooltips.
* Fixed bugs preventing reliably rolling restart of server processes.
* Fixed handling of several rare race conditions.
* Fixed inconsistencies in display order of group direct message recipients.
* Renamed `stream` to `channel` in generated URLs, now that enough
  time has passed since `channel` support was added to mobile clients.
* Optimized the presence synchronization protocol to use dramatically
  less network and CPU resources in large organizations.
* Optimized new database creation runtime by squashing almost 700
  database migrations.
* Optimized the performance of creating channels with thousands of
  initial subscribers.
* Reduced the size of static assets for an initial page load of the web
  app by 22% using `zopfli` compression. Emoji spritesheets are also
  now 30% smaller thanks to using the modern `webp` format.
* Migrated the remainder of the server’s API parsing code to the
  `typed_endpoint` abstraction backed by Pydantic v2, improving
  performance and readability of the server project.
* Migrate almost all of the remaining JavaScript code to TypeScript,
  fixing many minor bugs and latent issues.

#### Upgrade notes for 10.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-10-0 "Link to this heading")

* This release adds support for uploading arbitrarily large
  files. Because prior releases wrote the old default value of 25 (MB)
  for the `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` setting into `/etc/zulip/settings.py`
  during installation, you’ll want to consider increasing that. The
  new default value is 100. Since there is no technical limit, we
  recommend considering how much storage you allocated to your Zulip
  instance and the policy policy question of how you want to encourage
  your users to share videos or other very large files.
* The `SOCIAL_AUTH_SYNC_CUSTOM_ATTRS_DICT` setting is deprecated in favor of the
  more general `SOCIAL_AUTH_SYNC_ATTRS_DICT` setting structure, but still works in
  this release for a smooth upgrade experience. The new setting supports
  synchronizing role, and otherwise functions like the old one, except Zulip
  custom profile fields are referred to with the prefix `custom__`. See the updated
  comment documentation in `/etc/zulip/settings.py` for details.
* PostgreSQL 12 is no longer supported; if you are currently using it,
  you will need to [upgrade
  PostgreSQL](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-postgresql) before
  upgrading Zulip.

## Zulip Server 9.x series[](#zulip-server-9-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 9.3[](#zulip-server-9-3 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2024-11-22*

* The documentation for the Docker image no longer inaccurately
  describes it as alpha/experimental software.
* Fixed the database migration in 9.2,
  `0576_backfill_imageattachment.py`, to correctly find the files to
  process for installations using the S3 backend. Also added a
  progress indicator and a duplicate migration `0622` to rerun the
  migration code on files that were not processed due to the bug in 0576.
* Fixed a regression in 9.2 where `libldap-common` was missing on
  Docker systems, breaking LDAP authentication for some systems.
* Fixed the backup tool’s handling of configuration file symlinks in
  Docker systems.
* Fixed emoji appearing huge when viewing email notifications in
  Microsoft Outlook.
* Fixed the [slack-compatible incoming
  webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) to
  return success/failure HTTP responses in the correct format.
* Fixed several bugs with the data import tools, primarily around
  thumbnailing of images and input validation.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the recent view to show incomplete data.
* Fixed a rare bug where sending a message to a different conversation
  could result in navigating to that view with the newly sent message
  missing until the user reloaded that view.
* Fixed minor bugs with the lightbox’s image carousel.
* Fixed some rare deadlocks in the thumbnailing system.
* Fixed exceptions involving topics containing Unicode whitespace
  variables.
* Fixed certain Unicode characters being improperly escaped in email
  notifications.
* Fixed performance when deleting thousands of messages at once.
* Fixed previously-imported users who are invited to join Zulip using
  the imported role rather than invitation’s role.
* Improved hardening of desktop app against hypothetical DOM
  clobbering attacks.
* Added support for release events to the GitLab integration.
* Updated Python dependencies.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 9.2[](#zulip-server-9-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2024-09-12*

* Fixed a bug where images uploaded before the upgrade to Zulip 9.x
  would not be previewed properly if linked in a new message. This
  change involves a database migration,
  `0576_backfill_imageattachment.py`, that may take a long time to run
  on systems with many uploaded files. The Zulip server can be safely
  started using `scripts/restart-server` while this migration is
  running.
* Fixed size of EDITED/MOVED indicators when not using compact mode.
* Fixed Firefox being installed via an indirect `apt` recommendation.
* Fixed calculation of PostgreSQL client dependency.
* Fixed PGroonga installation on Ubuntu 24.04.
* Fixed incorrect HTML-encoding of unicode in email notifications.
* Fixed some bugs and documentation for the Rocket.Chat, Slack and
  Mattermost data import tools.
* Fixed several rare web app exceptions.
* Fixed an exception when deleting hundreds of uploaded files at once
  with the S3 file upload backend.
* Fixed data export tool to preserve original custom emoji files,
  rather than exporting a thumbnail.
* Fixed nonstandard specification of Sunday in cron configuration.
* Added new `change_auth_backends` management command to recover after
  locking oneself out by disabling authentication methods.
* Removed the `presence` queue worker, reducing memory requirements.
* Improved rendering performance for the main Zulip message feed.
* Improved formatting for Jira integration comment notifications.
* Improved layout for image loading indicators.
* Updated AzureAD authentication backend to use the v2.0 API, which
  supports personal accounts as well.
* Updated documentation for several webhook integrations.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 9.1[](#zulip-server-9-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2024-08-02*

* Clarified upgrade notes and installer error messages. Improved
  documentation to smooth the process of upgrading Ubuntu 20.04 to
  22.04 before upgrading to Zulip 9.x. Installations currently running
  Ubuntu 20.04 should first upgrade to the latest Zulip 8.x release,
  and then follow the [Zulip host OS upgrade
  instructions](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-the-operating-system)
  in preparation for upgrading to Zulip 9.x.
* Improved web and mobile app loading times and bandwidth usage by
  tuning API response compression and removing some unnecessary
  entropy in user object payloads.
* Fixed how Zulip handles a GitHub quirk, to avoid duplicate
  notifications when pull request reviews are submitted.
* Fixed a rare race condition that could cause uploaded images to be
  displayed as a perpetual loading spinner.
* Fixed video player controls appearing in the lightbox bottom
  carousel.
* Fix several minor visual bugs, most notably with composebox
  typeahead overflowing incorrectly.
* Fixed a subtle live-update bug rerendering the inbox view.
* Fixed a couple of subtle performance issues involving the analytics
  cron job and listing invitations in organization settings.
* Updated documentation for a couple of integrations.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 9.0[](#zulip-server-9-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2024-07-25*

#### Highlights[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

* Added support for Ubuntu 24.04, and dropped support for Ubuntu 20.04.
* To make it easier to discover what’s new in Zulip, important product changes
  are now announced via automated messages, which are shipped with the Zulip
  server version that includes the new feature. See the upgrade notes for
  details.
* To better match terminology familiar from other apps, “streams” have been
  renamed to “channels” across the app in this release. The functionality
  remains exactly the same, and integrations do not need to be updated for this
  transition.
* For clarity and consistency, three key message views that show multiple
  conversations at once are now labeled “Combined feed” (previously “All
  messages”), “Channel feed”, and “Direct message feed”.
* To make reading more comfortable, Zulip has been redesigned with a larger font
  size and line spacing. Because personal preferences vary, the previous design
  remains available via the compact mode setting.
* Redesigned the main search with pills for search filters, making it easier to
  use.
* When you paste content into the compose box, Zulip will now do its best to
  preserve the formatting, including links, bulleted lists, bold, italics, and
  more. If you don’t need the formatting, you can undo it with `Ctrl+Z`, or
  paste as plain text.
* To make it easier to read your messages topic-by-topic, channel links in the
  left sidebar now take you directly to the top topic in the channel. You can
  configure them to go to the channel feed instead (previously the only option).
* To quote and reply to part of a message, you can now select the part
  that you want to quote.
* The right sidebar has been redesigned to highlight users in the
  current channel or direct message conversation. You can also now
  hide the channel/user lists in the sidebars to reduce distraction.
* When you start composing, the most recently edited draft for the conversation
  you are composing to now automatically appears in the compose box. You can
  always save a draft for later and start a new message.
* Added a Reactions view to show how others have responded to your messages with
  emoji reactions. You can also search all messages with reactions.
* If you’d prefer not to see notifications when others type, you can
  now disable them.
* Topics and messages now load much faster when you open the web or
  desktop app.
* Uploaded images are now thumbnailed, making images load much faster
  in all clients. Newly uploaded animated images shown in the message
  feed now only animate on hover by default rather than continuously,
  with a user setting to control the animation. (Previously uploaded
  images, and image previews of third-party links, continue to
  directly use the original image).
* The onboarding experience has been redesigned to introduce core Zulip concepts
  when they first become relevant.
* Redesigned all popovers with a cleaner look, better icons, and improved screen
  reader accessibility.
* Added a new `with` narrow parameter for implementing permanent links
  to topics designed to handle topics being renamed or marked as
  resolved. This operator is not used in 9.0, but likely will be used
  by the topic-link Markdown feature starting with a 9.x maintenance
  release.

#### Full feature changelog[](#id2 "Link to this heading")

* The back button now preserves scroll position in previous views,
  as well as whether a channel’s full topic list is expanded.
* Sending a message to a different conversation now, by default,
  navigates to that conversation; a new setting controls this behavior.
* Added new `Alt+P` keyboard shortcut to toggle the Markdown preview
  in the compose box and message edit UI.
* Added new `Shift+V` keyboard shortcut to view read receipts.
* The `Shift+M` keyboard shortcut for muting now works in the recent
  conversations and inbox views.
* Redesigned the users panel in organization settings, subsuming the
  invitation and deactivated user panels and adding a new role filter.
* Redesigned the invite users modal to be much easier to use. Users
  can now decide whether to receive a DM when an invited user joins
  the organization.
* Redesigned the message edit history view as a modal.
* Redesigned the TODO list widget.
* Redesigned the Account Settings and Preferences sections of personal
  settings.
* All typeahead menus are now scrollable with up to 50 matches, making
  it easier to browse options.
* Improved compose typeahead sorting algorithms significantly. Compose
  typeaheads now appear next to the cursor, not above the compose box.

  indicated, how drafts are displayed, a cleaner way to expand the

#### Upgrade notes for 9.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-9-0 "Link to this heading")

* Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 must [upgrade their operating system to Ubuntu
  22.04](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-the-operating-system)
  before upgrading to Zulip 9.0.
* This release introduces a new [Zulip updates](https://zulip.com/help/configure-automated-notices#zulip-update-announcements) feature, which
  announces significant product changes and new features via automated
  messages to a configurable channel. Generally, these announcements will
  be sent automatically when upgrading to the new release. However, when
  you first upgrade to the 9.x series, they will be sent with a delay
  (explained in an automated direct message to organization administrators)
  to give time to potentially reconfigure which channel to use. You can
  override the delay by running `./manage.py send_zulip_update_announcements --skip-delay`
  once you’ve done any necessary configuration updates.
* We’ve reworked how Zulip’s mobile push notifications service is
  configured to be easier to understand, more extensible, and avoid
  hardcoding URLs unnecessarily. The old settings names are fully
  supported with identical behavior, so no action is required before
  upgrading.

  Once you’ve upgraded, while you’re [updating your settings.py
  documentation](../production/upgrade.html#updating-settings-py-inline-documentation), we recommend updating
  `/etc/zulip/settings.py` to use the modern settings names: Replacing
  `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_BOUNCER_URL = "https://push.zulipchat.com"` with
  `ZULIP_SERVICE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS = True` and renaming
  `SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS` to
  `ZULIP_SERVICE_SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS`, if you have either of those
  settings enabled. It’s important not to set both the old and new
  settings: The legacy settings will be ignored if the modern ones are
  present.

  The one minor functional change in this restructuring is that it is
  now possible to configure sharing usage statistics with the Zulip
  developers without attempting to send mobile push notifications via
  the service, by setting `ZULIP_SERVICE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS = False`
  and `ZULIP_SERVICE_SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS=True`.
* The Zulip server now thumbnails uploaded images for faster loading
  and reduced bandwidth usage; note that only images uploaded after
  upgrading to 9.0 benefit from this feature at present. Previews of
  linked images/websites continue to use the original third-party
  images, and thus have not yet been optimized in this way.
* Installations that any point in the past enabled the
  `THUMBNAIL_IMAGES` setting may have broken image previews on
  messages containing previews of third-party image links while that
  setting was enabled, due to incompatibilities between its approach
  and the new thumbnailing system. The `THUMBNAIL_IMAGES` setting was
  part of the experimental Thumbor-based thumbnailing system, which
  was offered as an option starting with Zulip 1.9.0 but removed 3
  years ago in Zulip 4.0. We recommend using [this chat.zulip.org
  thread](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/31-production-help/topic/THUMBNAIL_IMAGES.20remediation) to discuss remediation options
  for this issue before upgrading to 9.0 if you believe your
  installation may have used this setting.
* We’re aware of a slow memory leak in the new image thumbnailing
  queue worker. The leak is slow enough that for most installations,
  this is managed fully by the weekly server restart that Zulip does
  to manage memory leak risk. Installations with very little free
  memory that use a lot of images should consider adding a couple
  gigabytes of swap before upgrading to avoid memory pressure.
* The Zulip server now contains a KaTeX server worker, designed to
  make bulk-rendering LaTeX efficient. It has minimal memory
  footprint, but can be disabled using the `katex_server` [deployment
  option](../production/system-configuration.html) on very low memory
  systems that don’t use math extensively.
* This release contains some potentially slow database migrations for
  installations with thousands of users, especially
  `0544_copy_avatar_images`, which re-thumbnails every uploaded avatar
  using Zulip’s new image-processing pipeline.

*Released 2024-02-16*

* Fixed an error reporting bug that caused an email to be sent to the
  server administrator each time that the server had a failed attempt
  to send a mobile push notification. This bug could cause a lot of
  error emails on servers that are registered with the [Mobile Push
  Notification Service](../production/mobile-push-notifications.html), but are not signed up for a plan
  that includes access to this service, or not [uploading basic
  metadata](../production/mobile-push-notifications.html#uploading-usage-statistics) required to verify eligibility for
  free access to the service.

### Zulip Server 8.1[](#zulip-server-8-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2024-01-24*

* CVE-2024-21630: Zulip version 8.0 and its betas had a bug affecting
  an unlikely permissions configuration where some user roles had
  permission to create reusable invitation links to join the
  organization, but lacked the permission to subscribe other users to
  streams. A user with such a role could incorrectly create an
  invitation link that subscribes new users to streams. This
  vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use
  invitations, not single-user invites.
* Fixed a fault-tolerance bug, where failing outgoing email
  authentication could cause other queue workers to not progress
  properly on low-memory Zulip servers.

  PostgreSQL upgrade documentation if you’re interested in upgrading
  an existing server to newer Postgres.
* Added support for explicitly deactivating a mobile push
  notifications registration.
* Added support for a new class of custom authentication hook.
* Improved the workflow for sending password reset emails to users
  imported from another chat app.

  sidebar is configured.
* Fixed a bug preventing the incoming email integration from
  mentioning groups that everyone is allowed to mention.

  some servers.
* Fixed Slack data import tool corner cases involving shared users.
* Fixed mentions being incorrectly converted to silent mentions in DMs
  with bot users.
* Fixed an unexploitable HTML injection bug in the typeahead for
  configuring custom code playgrounds.
* Improved in-app documentation for following topics.
* Backported several documentation improvements.

### Zulip Server 8.0[](#zulip-server-8-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-12-15*

#### Highlights[](#id3 "Link to this heading")

* New Inbox view shows all unread messages in a conveniently
  browsable experience, similar to the mobile home screen. It is an
  option for the user’s home view.
* Added support for following a topic, with configurable notification
  settings for followed topics and flexible configuration options to
  automatically follow topics when sending a message or otherwise
  interacting with it, or when mentioned. New `Shift + N` keyboard
  shortcut navigates to the next unread followed topic.
* Added support for limiting user list access for guests.
* New @topic mentions support mentioning only users who have
  participated in a topic by sending a message or emoji reaction.
* Typing notifications now support streams with 100 or fewer
  subscribers.
* Clicking on a message in search views now directly takes the user to
  the target message, instead of starting a reply, since it’s rare one
  wants to reply without full context.
* The left sidebar now allows collapsing the global views for users
  who want more space for streams and conversations.
* Added new unread count display style setting, controlling in which
  streams to display a numeric unread count or a simple dot unread
  indicator. Defaults to numeric counts in normal streams, but a dot
  indicator in muted streams.
* Added support for creating voice calls.
* Major visual design improvements in the message feed, search
  area/navbar, and left sidebar. The gear menu was replaced with three
  new redesigned menus: A help menu, a personal/avatar menu, and a
  more focused gear menu.
* Added thumbnails and lightbox player support for video links and
  video files uploaded directly in Zulip. Previously, Zulip only
  supported this for videos hosted by third-party platforms that
  provide an embedded player, like YouTube and Vimeo.
* The compose area was redesigned, with new formatting buttons for
  most message formatting features, including polls. Improved pasting
  URLs with text selected. Topic typeahead now indicates whether one
  would be creating a new topic, and user typeahead now shows pronouns
  if a pronoun custom profile field is configured.

* Upgraded many dependencies.

#### Upgrade notes for 8.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-8-0 "Link to this heading")

* Installations using the [Mobile Push Notifications
  Service](../production/mobile-push-notifications.html) now regularly upload [basic
  metadata](../production/mobile-push-notifications.html#uploading-usage-statistics) about the organizations hosted by
  the installation to the Mobile Push Notifications
  Service. Previously, basic metadata was uploaded only when uploading
  usage statistics was also enabled via the `SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS`
  setting.
* This release contains several expensive migrations, most notably
  `0472_add_message_realm_id_indexes.py`,
  `0485_alter_usermessage_flags_and_add_index.py`, and
  `0486_clear_old_data_for_unused_usermessage_flags.py`. Migration
  `0486`, in particular, cleans up stale that should only be present
  on Zulip servers that were originally installed with Zulip 1.3.x or
  older. If your server has millions of messages, plan for the
  migrations in this release to take 15 minutes or more to complete.
* Minor: User group names starting with `@`, `role:`, `user:`, and
  various certain other special patterns are now forbidden. In the
  unlikely event that existing user groups have names matching these
  patterns, they will be automatically renamed on upgrade.
* The behavior of the `AUTH_LDAP_ADVANCED_REALM_ACCESS_CONTROL` has
  subtly changed. Previously, using this setting at all would block
  LDAP authentication in organizations that are configured to use LDAP
  authentication but not explicitly configured with advanced access
  controls. This behavior was removed to simplify hosting multiple
  organizations with different LDAP configuration preferences.

## Zulip Server 7.x series[](#zulip-server-7-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 7.5[](#zulip-server-7-5 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-11-16*

* CVE-2023-47642: Invalid metadata access for formerly subscribed streams.
  It was discovered by the Zulip development team that active users who had
  previously been subscribed to a stream incorrectly continued being able to use
  the Zulip API to access metadata for that stream. As a result, users who had
  been removed from a stream, but still had an account in the organization,
  could still view metadata for that stream (including the stream name,
  description, settings, and an email address used to send emails into the
  stream via the incoming email integration). This potentially allowed users to
  see changes to a stream’s metadata after they had lost access to the stream.
  This bug was present in all Zulip releases prior to Zulip Server 7.5.
* Fixed a bug where [backups](../production/export-and-import.html#backups) might
  be written using `postgresql-client-16`, which could not be straightforwardly
  restored into a Zulip instance, as the format is not backwards-compatible, and
  Zulip does not yet support PostgreSQL 16.
* Renamed the `reactivate_stream` management command to `unarchive_stream`, to
  match terminology in the app, and [documented
  it](https://zulip.com/help/archive-a-channel#unarchiving-archived-channels).
* Fixed a regression, introduced in 6.0, where users created via the API or LDAP
  would have English set as their language, ignoring the configured realm
  default.
* Improved [documentation on `AUTH_LDAP_ADVANCED_REALM_ACCESS_CONTROL`](../production/authentication-methods.html#restricting-ldap-user-access-to-specific-organizations).
* Improved error messages for subdomains being reserved versus being in use.
* Upgraded Python dependencies.

### Zulip Server 7.4[](#zulip-server-7-4 "Link to this heading")

* Upgrade dependencies.

### Zulip Server 7.3[](#zulip-server-7-3 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-08-25*

* CVE-2023-32678: Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream, and have
  since been removed from it, retained the ability to edit messages/topics and
  delete messages that they used to have access to, if other relevant
  organization permissions allowed these actions. For example, a user may have
  still been able to edit or delete their old messages they had posted in such a
  private stream.
* Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.0, which would cause uploaded files
  attached to some messages to be mistakenly deleted after some, but not all,
  messages linking to the uploaded file were deleted by the user. See our
  [blog post](https://blog.zulip.com/2023/08/25/uploaded-file-data-loss-incident/) for more details.
* Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.2 in the
  [operating system upgrade process](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-the-operating-system),
  which would cause errors of the form
  `venv was not set up for this Python version`.
* Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.2, when the
  [email gateway](../production/email-gateway.html)
  was used in conjunction with a
  [reverse proxy](../production/reverse-proxies.html).
* Improved the performance of
  [resolving](https://zulip.com/help/resolve-a-topic) or
  [moving](https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-topic) long topics.
* Fixed bad rendering of stream links in
  [stream descriptions](https://zulip.com/help/change-the-channel-description).
* Fixed broken and misaligned images in Zulip welcome emails.
* Fixed YouTube video previews to be ordered in the order they are linked, not
  reverse order.
* Upgraded Python requirements.
* Updated puppet dependencies.
* Improved the [Sentry integration](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/sentry),
  including making the “Test plugin” button in Sentry work properly.
* Reduced memory usage by replacing a custom error reporting handler with the
  default Django implementation. This will result in a slight change in the
  format of server exception emails. Such emails should be rare in most
  self-hosted systems; installations with a large amount of server exception
  volume should be using the
  [Sentry integration](../subsystems/logging.html#sentry-error-logging).
* Updated the
  [data export tool](../production/export-and-import.html#data-export)
  to handle bots created in very early versions of Zulip Server.
* Fixed a bug with the
  [data export tool](../production/export-and-import.html#data-export)
  and deleted users in group DMs.
* Added a `./manage.py reactivate-stream` command to reactivate archived
  streams.
* Fixed links in the documentation to
  [Modify Zulip](../production/modify.html)
  and
  [Upgrade Zulip](../production/upgrade.html)
  pages.
* Linked the documentation on how to
  [host multiple Zulip](../production/multiple-organizations.html)
  organizations on one server.
* Fixed missing images in documentation for the
  [“XKCD” bot](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/xkcd).
* Fixed “Back to login page” button alignment in the desktop app.
* Added a reference to
  [PostgreSQL upgrades](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-postgresql)
  in the
  [release upgrade](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
  section.
* Clarified that PostgreSQL versions must match in
  “[Restoring backups](../production/export-and-import.html#restoring-backups)”
  section, and explain how to do that.
* Reformatted Changelog.

### Zulip Server 7.2[](#zulip-server-7-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-07-05*

* Started logging a more accurate, detailed, and actionable error messages when
  [common reverse proxy misconfigurations](../production/reverse-proxies.html#configuring-zulip-to-trust-proxies) are detected.
* Improved [reverse proxy documentation](../production/reverse-proxies.html#configuring-zulip-to-trust-proxies) to clarify that trust of
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` is also necessary.
* Removed [reverse proxy](../production/reverse-proxies.html#configuring-zulip-to-trust-proxies) nginx configuration files when the
  [`loadbalancer.ips`](../production/system-configuration.html#ips)
  setting has been unset.
* Improved error-handling of scheduled emails, so they cannot attempt infinite
  deliveries of a message with no recipients.
* Fixed a bug with the
  [PGroonga integration](../subsystems/full-text-search.html#multi-language-full-text-search)
  that would cause the PostgreSQL server to crash when a search was run.
* Fixed a bug that would cause some messages not to be marked as read.
* Fixed a bug that still showed file-upload banners after re-opening the compose
  box.
* Fixed a bug that prevented file uploads with very unusual file names.
* Adjusted the bot icon to make it more visible on the light theme.
* Fixed minor rendering issues on the “press enter to send” indicator.
* Fixed the scrollbar behavior on the stream settings page.
* Improved error reporting when a Slack token fails to validate during
  [import](https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack#export-your-slack-data),
  such as a token having too few permissions.
* Added support for IPv6
  [nameservers in the nginx configuration](../production/system-configuration.html#nameserver).
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 7.1[](#zulip-server-7-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-06-13*

* Added checks to check that Zulip is being installed on a
  [supported CPU and OS architecture](../production/requirements.html).
* Improved error-handling around the
  [`upgrade-postgresql`](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-postgresql)
  tool.
* Fixed a couple bugs in database migrations as part of the upgrade that could
  cause the upgrade to fail to complete.
* Fixed a bug where
  [scheduled messages](https://zulip.com/help/schedule-a-message) with `@all`
  would fail to send.
* Fixed a bug which would sometimes cause the `j` and `k` keys to not be able to
  be typed in the compose box.
* Fixed anonymous access to the “download” link on images in
  [public-access streams](https://zulip.com/help/public-access-option).
* Changed the default DNS resolver in nginx’s configuration to match the
  system’s; this fixes deployments which use the
  [S3 storage backend](../production/upload-backends.html)
  and did not run `systemd-resolved`, like Docker and some versions of Debian.
* Updated several pieces of documentation.
* Updated translations, including new translations for Luri (Bakhtiari),
  Brazilian Portuguese, and Tagalog.

### Zulip Server 7.0[](#zulip-server-7-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-05-31*

#### Highlights[](#id5 "Link to this heading")

* Many significant visual changes as part of Zulip’s ongoing redesign
  project, including message feed headers, background color, mention
  colors, dates and times, compose box banners, icons, and
  tooltips. Many further improvements are planned for future releases.

  interface, including search operators. We expect further API changes
  to be integrated gradually over coming releases due to backwards
  compatibility considerations.
* Added a new personal privacy setting for to what extent the user’s
  email address should be shared with other users in the organization;
  previously this was solely controlled by organization
  administrators. This is presented to the user during account
  creation, including for users imported from other chat products.

#### Upgrade notes for 7.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-7-0 "Link to this heading")

* When the [S3 storage backend](../production/upload-backends.html) is used for
  storing file uploads, those contents are now fetched by nginx, cached locally
  on the server, and served to clients; this lets clients cache the contents,
  and saves them a redirect. However, it may require administrators adjust the
  size of the server’s cache if they have a large deploy; see the
  [documentation](../production/upload-backends.html#s3-local-caching).
* Removed the `application_server.no_serve_uploads` setting in
  `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf`, as all uploads requests go through Zulip now.
* Installations using the previously undocumented [JWT authentication
  feature](../production/authentication-methods.html#jwt) will need
  to make minor adjustments in the format of JWT requests; see the
  documentation for details on the new format.
* High volume log files like `server.log` are now by default retained
  for 14 days, configured via the `access_log_retention_days`
  [deployment
  option](../production/system-configuration.html). This
  replaces a harder to understand size-based algorithm that was not
  easily configurable.
* The URL patterns for
  [linkifiers](https://zulip.com/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) have
  been migrated from a custom format string to RFC 6570 URL
  templates. A database migration will automatically migrate existing
  linkifiers correctly in the vast majority of cases, but some fancier
  linkfiers may require manual adjustment to generate correct URLs
  following this upgrade.
* PostgreSQL 11 is no longer supported; if you are currently using it, you will
  need to [upgrade PostgreSQL](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-postgresql)
  before upgrading Zulip.
* Installations that deploy Zulip behind a [reverse proxy](../production/reverse-proxies.html)
  should make sure the proxy is configured to set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP
  header, and that [`loadbalancer.ips` is accurate](../production/reverse-proxies.html#configuring-zulip-to-trust-proxies) for the
  reverse proxy’s IP; the documentation has updated its example configurations.
* Zulip’s Twitter preview integration has been disabled due to Twitter
  desupporting the API that it relied on.

## Zulip Server 6.x series[](#zulip-server-6-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 6.2[](#zulip-server-6-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-05-19*

* CVE-2023-28623: Fixed a vulnerability that would allow users to sign up for a
  Zulip Server account with an unauthorized email address, despite the server
  being configured to require that email addresses be in LDAP. Specifically, if
  the organization permissions don’t require invitations to join, and the only
  configured authentication backends were `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and some other
  external authentication backend (any aside from `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and
  `EmailAuthBackend`), then an unprivileged remote attacker could have created a
  new account in the organization with an arbitrary email address in their
  control that was not in the organization’s LDAP directory.
* CVE-2023-32677: Fixed a vulnerability which allowed users to invite new users
  to streams when inviting them to the server, even if they did not have
  [permission to invite existing users to streams](https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-channels).
  This did not allow users to invite others to streams that they themselves were
  not a member of, and only affected deployments with the rare configuration of
  a permissive
  [realm invitation policy](https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations)
  and a strict
  [stream invitation policy](https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-channels).
* Fixed a bug that could cause duplicate push notifications when using the
  mobile push notifications service.
* Fixed several bugs in the Zulip server and PostgreSQL version upgrade
  processes.
* Fixed multiple Recent conversations display bugs for private message
  conversations.
* Fixed the left sidebar stream list exiting “more topics” during background
  re-rendering, and a related rendering bug.
* Fixed a bug where uploaded files sent via the email gateway were not correctly
  associated with the message’s sender.
* Improved error handling for certain puppet failures.
* Silenced a distracting `caniuse browserlist` warning in install/upgrade
  output.

* Documented how to manage email address changes when using the LDAP backend.
* Documented how to use SMTP without authentication.
* Documented that the Zulip mobile/desktop apps now only support Zulip Server
  4.0 and newer (released 22 months ago), following our 18-month support policy.
* Extracted the documentation on modifying Zulip to a dedicated page.
* Added a new `send_welcome_bot_message` management command, to allow the
  sysadmin to send Welcome Bot messages manually after a data import.
* Added new `RABBITMQ_USE_TLS` and `RABBITMQ_PORT` settings for installations
  wanting to configure the RabbitMQ connection with a remote RabbitMQ host.
* Added a new `timesync` deployment option to allow installations to override
  Zulip’s default of `chrony` for time synchronization.
* Upgraded dependencies for security and bug fixes.

### Zulip Server 6.1[](#zulip-server-6-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2023-01-23*

  affected users would only see a blank page.
* Recent conversations now displays the “Participants” column for private
  messages too.
* Fixed minor bugs in “Recent conversations” focus and re-rendering.
* Fixed bugs that caused some unicode emoji to be incorrectly unavailable.

  desktop app that would cause horizontal lines to appear between messages.
* Stopped clipping the tops of tall characters in stream and topic names.
* Use internationalized form of “at” in message timestamps.
* Updated translations.
* Fixed the “custom” value for the
  “[delay before sending message notification emails](https://zulip.com/help/email-notifications)”
  setting.
* Fixed an error which prevented users from changing
  [stream-specific notification settings](https://zulip.com/help/channel-notifications#configure-notifications-for-a-single-channel).
* Fixed the redirect from `/apps` to https://zulip.com/apps/.
* Started preserving timezone information in
  [Rocket.Chat imports](https://zulip.com/help/import-from-rocketchat).
* Updated the Intercom integration to return success on `HEAD`
  requests, which it uses to verify its configuration.
* Documented how each
  [rate limit](../production/security-model.html#rate-limiting)
  category is used.
* Documented the `reset_authentication_attempt_count` command for when users
  lock themselves out.
* Documented the
  [full S3 bucket policy](../production/upload-backends.html#s3-bucket-policy)
  for avatar and uploads buckets.
* Clarified what the `--email` value passed to the installer will be used for.
* Hid harmless “non-existent database” warnings during initial installation.
* Forced a known locale when upgrading PostgreSQL, which avoids errors when
  using some terminal applications.
* Verified that PostgreSQL was running after upgrading it, in case a previous
  try at an upgrade left it stopped.
* Updated custom emoji migration 0376 to be a single SQL statement, and no
  longer crash when no active owners were found.
* Replaced `transifex-client` internationalization library with new
  `transifex-cli`.
* Began respecting proxy settings when installing `shellcheck` and `shfmt`
  tools.
* Fixed the invitation code to signal a user data validation error, and not a
  server error, if an invalid “invite as” value was given.
* Renamed internal exceptions to end with `Error`.

### Zulip Server 6.0[](#zulip-server-6-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-11-17*

#### Highlights[](#id7 "Link to this heading")

* Users can now mark messages as unread.
* Added support for viewing read receipts, along with settings
  allowing both organizations and individual users to disable them.
* Added new compose box button to navigate to the conversation being
  composed to, when that is different from the current view.
* Added a scroll-to-bottom button, analogous to the `End` shortcut,
  that appears only when scrolling using the mouse.
* Added support for up to 2 custom profile fields being highlighted in
  a user’s profile summary popover, and added support for a new
  Pronouns custom field type designed to take advantage of
  it. Redesigned the custom profile fields administrative UI.
* Redesigned the left sidebar to better organize pinned and inactive
  streams, highlight topics where the user was mentioned, and better
  advertise streams that the current user can subscribe to.
* Redesigned the private messages experience in the left sidebar to
  make browsing conversations more ergonomic, with a similar usage
  pattern to browsing the topics within a stream.
* Improved “Recent topics” and renamed it to “Recent conversations”
  with the addition of including private messages in the view. The
  timestamp links now go to the latest message in the topic, arrow key
  navigation was improved, topics containing unread mentions are now
  highlighted, as well as many other bug fixes or subtle improvements.
* Messages containing 3 or fewer emoji reactions now display the names
  of reacting users alongside the emoji. This eliminates the need to
  mouse over emoji reactions to find out who reacted in the vast
  majority of cases.
* Replaced the previous “Unavailable” status with a “Go invisible” feature
  that is more useful and intuitive.
* The right sidebar now displays user status messages by default, with
  an optional compact design available.
* The [public access option](https://blog.zulip.com/2022/05/05/public-access-option/) was enhanced to
  skip the login page by default, support switching themes and
  languages, and add many other UI improvements.
* Incoming webhook integrations now support filtering which classes of events
  are sent into Zulip; this can be invaluable when the third-party service
  doesn’t support configuring which events to send to Zulip.
* Added support for Ubuntu 22.04.
* Removed support for Debian 10 and PostgreSQL 10 due to their
  approaching end-of-life upstream.
* New integrations: Azure DevOps, RhodeCode, wekan.

#### Full feature changelog[](#id8 "Link to this heading")

* Redesigned the message actions popover to be better organized.
* Redesigned moving messages to have a cleaner, more consistent UI that is no
  longer combined with the message editing UI. One can now choose to send
  automated notices when moving messages within a stream, not only between
  streams.
* Redesigned full user profiles to have a cleaner look and also
  display user IDs, which can be important when using the API. Users
  can now administer bot stream subscriptions from the bot’s full
  profile.
* Redesigned the gear menu to display basic details about the Zulip
  organization, server, and its version.
* Redesigned several organization settings pages to have more
  consistent design.
* Redesigned the footer for self-hosted Zulip servers. The footer now has just a
  few key links, rather than being almost identical to the footer for the
  zulip.com website.
* Redesigned the 500 error pages for self-hosted Zulip servers to be
  clearer and link to the Zulip server troubleshooting guide.
* Redesigned the interface for configuring message editing and
  deletion permissions to be easier to understand.
* Added support for emoji added in unicode versions since 2017, which
  had previously been unavailable in Zulip. Users using the deprecated
  “Google blobs” emoji set are automatically migrated to the modern
  “Google” emoji set. The “Google blobs” emoji set remains available
  for users who prefer it, with any new emoji that were added to the
  Unicode standard since 2017 displayed in the modern “Google” style.
* Added support for changing the role of bots in the UI; previously,
  this was only possible via the API.
* Added confirmation modals for various destructive actions, such as
  deactivating bots.
* Added new summary statistics on the organization analytics
  page. Fixed several bugs with the display of analytics graphs.
* Added support for administrators sending a final email to a user as
  part of deactivating their Zulip account.
* Added API endpoint to get a single stream by ID.
* Added beta support for user groups to have subgroups, and for some
  permissions settings to be managed using user groups. Over the
  coming releases, we plan to migrate all Zulip permissions settings
  to be based on this more flexible groups-based system. We currently
  expect this migration to be fully backwards-compatible.
* Added a new compliance export management command.
* Zulip’s automated emails use the `X-Auto-Response-Suppress` header
  to reduce auto-responder replies.
* Changed various icons to be more intuitive. The bell-based icon for
  muted topics has been replaced by a more standard muted speaker icon.
* Reworked how a new user’s language is set to prefer their browser’s
  configured language over the organization’s configured
  language. This organization-level setting has been renamed to
  “Language for automated messages and invitation emails” to reflect
  what it actually does following this change.
* Organized the Drafts panel to prioritize drafts matching the current
  view.
* Added an automated notification to the “stream events” topic when
  changing a stream’s privacy settings.
* Added support for conveniently overriding the default rate-limiting rules.
* Improved the search typeahead to show profile pictures for users.
* Improved typeahead matching algorithm for stream/user/emoji names
  containing multiple spaces and other corner cases.
* Improved the help center, including better display of keyboard
  shortcuts, mobile documentation for common workflows and many polish
  improvements.
* Improved API documentation, including a new page on roles and
  permissions, an audit to correct missing **Changes** entries, and
  new documentation for several previously undocumented endpoints.
* Improved Python static type-checking to make use of Django stubs for
  `mypy`, fixing many minor bugs in the process.
* Improved RealmAuditLog to cover several previously unauditable changes.
* Improved the experience for users who have not logged in for a long
  time, and receive an email or push notification about a private
  message or personal mention. These users are now automatically soft
  reactivated at the time of the notification, for a smoother
  experience when they log in.
* Improved the Tornado server-to-client push system’s sharding system
  to support realm regular expressions and experimental support for
  splitting a single realm across multiple push server processes.
* Improved user deactivation modal to provide details about bots and
  invitations that will be disabled.
* Improve matching algorithm for left sidebar stream filtering.
* Improved several integrations, including CircleCI, Grafana, Harbor,
  NewRelic, and the Slack compatible incoming webhook. Git webhooks
  now use a consistent algorithm for choosing shortened commit IDs to
  display.
* Improved mention typeahead and rendering for cases where mention
  syntax appears next to symbols.
* Improved browser window titles used by the app to be clearer.
* Improved the language in message notification emails explaining
  why the notification was sent.
* Improved interface for accessing stream email addresses.
* Reordered the organization settings panels to be more intuitive.
* Increased timeout for processing slow requests from 20s to 60s.
* Removed the “user list in left sidebar in narrow windows” setting.
* Removed limits that prevented replying to Zulip email notifications multiple
  times or, several days after receiving them.
* Fixed numerous bugs and performance issues with the Rocket.Chat data
  import tool. Improved importing emoji from Slack.
* Fixed several bugs where drafts could fail to be saved.
* Fixed a bug where copy-paste would incorrectly copy an entire message.
* Fixed the app’s main loading page to not suggest reloading until
  several seconds have passed.
* Fixed multiple bugs that could cause the web app to flood the server
  with requests after the computer wakes up from suspend.
* Fixed a bug where public streams imported from other chat systems
  could incorrectly be configured as public streams without shared
  history, a configuration not otherwise possible in Zulip.
* Fixed several subtle bugs involving editing custom profile field
  configuration.
* Fixed several bugs involving compose box keyboard shortcuts.
* Fixed dozens of settings UI interaction design bugs.
* Fixed subtle caching bugs in the URL preview system.
* Fixed several rare race conditions in the server implementation.
* Fixed many CSS corner cases issues involving content overflowing containers.
* Fixed entering an emoji in the mobile web app using an emoji
  keyboard.
* Fixed Enter being processed incorrectly when inputting a character
  into Zulip phonetically via an IME composing session.
* Fixed several subtle bugs with confirmation links.
* Fixed a subtle performance issue for full-text search for uncommon words.
* Fixed the estimator for the size of public data exports.
* Fixed “mark all as read” requiring a browser reload.
* Major improvements to our documentation for setting up the development
  environment and for joining the project as a new contributor.
* Extracted several JavaScript modules to share code with the mobile
  app.
* Replaced several Python linters with Ruff, an incredibly fast
  Python linter written in Rust.
* Upgraded many third-party dependencies including Django 4.1, and
  substantially modernized the Python codebase.

#### Upgrade notes for 6.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-6-0 "Link to this heading")

* Installations using [docker-zulip](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip) will need to [upgrade
  Postgres](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip/#upgrading-zulipzulip-postgresql-to-14) before upgrading to Zulip
  6.0, because the previous default of Postgres 10 is no longer
  supported by this release.
* Installations using the AzureAD authentication backend will need to
  update `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf` after upgrading. The
  `azure_oauth2_secret` secret was renamed to
  `social_auth_azuread_oauth2_secret`, to match our other external
  authentication methods.
* This release contains an expensive migration,
  `0419_backfill_message_realm`, which adds data to a new `realm`
  column in the message table. Expect it to run for 10-15 minutes per
  million messages in the database. The new column is not yet used in
  this release, so this migration can be run in the background for
  installations hoping to avoid extended downtime.
* Custom profile fields with “Pronouns” in their name and the “short
  text” field type were converted to the new “Pronouns” field type.

## Zulip Server 5.x series[](#zulip-server-5-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 5.7[](#zulip-server-5-7 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-11-16*

* CVE-2022-41914: Fixed the verification of the SCIM account
  management bearer tokens to use a constant-time comparator. Zulip
  Server 5.0 through 5.6 checked SCIM bearer tokens using a comparator
  that did not run in constant time. For organizations with SCIM
  account management enabled, this bug theoretically allowed an
  attacker to steal the SCIM bearer token, and use it to read and
  update the Zulip organization’s user accounts. In practice, this
  vulnerability may not have been practical or exploitable. Zulip
  Server installations which have not explicitly enabled SCIM are not
  affected.
* Fixed an error with deactivating users with `manage.py sync_ldap_user_data`
  when `LDAP_DEACTIVATE_NON_MATCHING_USERS` was enabled.
* Fixed several subtle bugs that could lead to browsers reloading
  repeatedly when the server was updated.
* Fixed a live-update bug when changing certain notifications
  settings.
* Improved error logs when sending push notifications to the push
  notifications service fails.
* Upgraded Python requirements.

### Zulip Server 5.6[](#zulip-server-5-6 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-08-24*

* CVE-2022-36048: Change the Markdown renderer to only rewrite known
  local links as relative links, rather than rewriting all local
  links. This fix also protects against a vulnerability in the Zulip
  mobile app (CVE-2022-35962).
* Added hardening against timing attacks to an internal authentication check.
* Improved documentation for hosting multiple organizations on a server.
* Updated dependencies.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 5.5[](#zulip-server-5-5 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-07-21*

* CVE-2022-31168: Fix authorization check for changing bot roles. Due
  to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and all prior
  releases, a member of an organization could craft an API call that
  would grant organization administrator privileges to one of their bots.
* Added new options to the `restore-backup` tool to simplify restoring
  backups on a system with a different configuration.
* Updated translations, including major updates to the Mongolian and
  Serbian translations.

### Zulip Server 5.4[](#zulip-server-5-4 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-07-11*

* CVE-2022-31134: Exclude private file uploads from [exports of public
  data](https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-for-migrating-to-zulip-cloud-or-a-self-hosted-server).
  We would like to thank Antoine Benoist for bringing this issue to our attention.
* Upgraded python requirements.
* Improved documentation for load balancers to mention CIDR address
  ranges.
* Documented an explicit list of supported CPU architectures.
* Switched `html2text` to run as a subprocess, rather than a Python
  module, as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
* Replaced `markdown-include` python module with a reimplementation,
  as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
* Relicensed as GPL the `tools/check-thirdparty` developer tool which
  verifies third-party licenses, due to a GPL dependency by way of
  `python-debian`.
* Closed a potential race condition in the Tornado server, with events
  arriving at exactly the same time as request causing server errors.
* Added a tool to help automate more of the release process.

### Zulip Server 5.3[](#zulip-server-5-3 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-06-21*

* CVE-2022-31017: Fixed message edit event exposure in
  protected-history streams.
  Zulip allows a stream to be configured as [private with protected
  history](https://zulip.com/help/channel-permissions#private-channels),
  which means that new subscribers should only see messages sent after
  they join. However, due to a logic bug in Zulip Server 2.1.0 through
  5.2, when a message was edited, the server would incorrectly send an
  API event that included both the edited and old content of the
  message to all of the stream’s current subscribers, regardless of
  whether they could see the original message. The impact of this
  issue was reduced by the fact that this API event is ignored by
  official clients, so it could only be observed by a user using a
  modified client or their browser’s developer tools.
* Adjusted upgrade steps to cause servers using PostgreSQL 14 to
  upgrade to PostgreSQL 14.4, which fixes an important potential
  database corruption issue.
* Upgraded the asynchronous request handling to use Tornado 6.
* Fixed a crash when displaying the error message for a failed attempt
  to create a stream.
* Optimized the steps during `upgrade-zulip`, to reduce the amount of
  server downtime.
* Added a `--skip-restart` flag to `upgrade-zulip` which prepares the
  new version, but does not restart the server into it.
* Stopped mirroring the entire remote Git repository directly into
  `/srv/zulip.git`. This mirroring removed local branches and confused
  the state of previous deployments.
* Fixed a bug which could cause the `delete_old_unclaimed_attachments`
  command-line tool to remove attachments that were still referenced
  by deleted (but not yet permanently removed) messages.
* Stopped enabling `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` by default, which was
  generally unneeded; the proxy documentation now clarifies when it is
  necessary.
* Fixed the nginx configuration to include the default system-level
  nginx modules.
* Only attempt to fix the `certbot` SSL renewal configuration if HTTPS
  is enabled; this addresses a regression in Zulip Server 5.2, where
  the upgrade would fail if an improperly configured certificate
  existed, but was both expired and not in use.
* Improved proxy and database backup documentation.

### Zulip Server 5.2[](#zulip-server-5-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-05-03*

* Fixed a performance regression in the UI, introduced in 5.0, when
  opening the compose box.
* Fixed a bug which could intermittently cause URL previews to fail,
  if Zulip was being run in Docker or in low-memory environments.
* Fixed an issue which would cause PostgreSQL 10 and PostgreSQL 11 to
  attempt to write each WAL log to S3, even if S3 WAL
  backups/replication were not configured.
* Fixed an issue which prevented the SCIM integration from
  deactivating users.
* Fixed a bug that resulted in an “You unsubscribed” notice
  incorrectly appearing when new messages arrived in a topic being
  viewed via a “near” link.
* Fixed digest emails being incorrectly sent if a user was deactivated
  after the digest was enqueued but before it was processed.
* Fixed warning about `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` being unset when
  explicitly set to empty.
* Fixed incomplete tracebacks when timeouts happen during Markdown
  rendering.
* Fixed some older versions of Zulip Server not being considered when
  comparing for the likely original version of `settings.py`.
* Stopped using the `database_password` if it is set but
  `database_user` is not.
* Stopped trying to fix LetsEncrypt certificate configuration if they
  were not currently in use.
* Sorted and prettified the output of the
  `check-database-compatibility` tool.
* Split the large `zerver/lib/actions.py` file into many files under
  `zerver/actions/`. This non-functional change was backported to
  ensure it remains easy to backport other changes.
* Updated documentation to reflect that current mobile apps are only
  guaranteed to be compatible with Zulip Server 3.0 and later; they
  may also work with earlier versions, with a degraded experience.

### Zulip Server 5.1[](#zulip-server-5-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-04-01*

* Fixed upgrade bug where preexisting animated emoji would still
  always animate in statuses.
* Improved check that prevents servers from accidentally downgrading,
  to not block upgrading servers that originally installed Zulip
  Server prior to mid-2017.
* Fixed email address de-duplication in Slack imports.
* Prevented an extraneous scrollbar when a notification banner was
  present across the top.
* Fixed installation in LXC containers, which failed due to `chrony`
  not being runnable there.
* Prevented a “push notifications not configured” warning from
  appearing in the new user default settings panel even when push
  notifications were configured.
* Fixed a bug which, in uncommon configurations, would prevent Tornado
  from being restarted during upgrades; users would be able to log in,
  but would immediately be logged out.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 5.0[](#zulip-server-5-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-03-29*

#### Highlights[](#id9 "Link to this heading")

* New [resolve topic](https://zulip.com/help/resolve-a-topic) feature
  allows marking topics as ✔ completed. It’s a lightweight way to
  manage a variety of workflows, including support interactions,
  answering questions, and investigating issues.
* Administrators may enable the option to create [web-public
  streams](https://zulip.com/help/public-access-option). Web-public
  streams can be viewed by anyone on the Internet without creating an
  account in your organization.
* Users can now select a status emoji alongside their status
  message. Status emoji are shown next to the user’s name in the
  sidebars, message feed, and compose box. Animated status emoji will
  only animate on hover.

  italics and links as well as visual improvements. New button for
  inserting global times into your message.
* Redesigned “Stream settings” to be much more usable, with separate
  tabs for personal settings, global settings, and membership, and
  more consistent style with the rest of Zulip’s settings.
* Stream creation was redesigned with a much cleaner interface,
  especially for selecting initial subscribers.
* Redesigned “Full user profile” widget to show the user’s stream and
  user group subscriptions. Administrators can unsubscribe a user from

  permission, rather than just allowing administrators or everyone.
* Permanent links to conversations now correctly redirect if the
  target message has been moved to a new stream or topic.
* Added a data import tool for migrating from Rocket.Chat. Mattermost
  data import now supports importing uploaded files.
* Improved handling of messages containing many images; now up to 20
  images can be previewed in a single message (up from 5), and a new
  grid layout will be used.
* OpenID Connect joins SAML, LDAP, Google, GitHub, Azure Active
  Directory, and more as a supported Single Sign-On provider.
* SAML authentication now supports syncing custom profile
  fields. Additionally, SAML authentication now supports automatic
  account creation and IdP-initiated logout.
* Added SCIM integration for synchronizing accounts with an external
  user database.
* Added support for installation on ARM platforms (including Mac M1).
* Removed support for Ubuntu 18.04, which no longer receives upstream
  security support for key Zulip dependencies.

#### Upgrade notes for 5.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-5-0 "Link to this heading")

* This release contains a migration, `0009_confirmation_expiry_date_backfill`,
  that can take several minutes to run on a server with millions of
  messages of history.
* The `TERMS_OF_SERVICE` and `PRIVACY_POLICY` settings have been
  removed in favor of a system that supports additional policy
  documents, such as a code of conduct. See the [updated
  documentation](../production/settings.html) for the new system.

* Fixed exceptions in races involving messages being deleted while
  processing a request to add emoji reactions, mark messages as read,
  or sending notifications.
* Fixed most remaining 500 errors seen in Zulip Cloud (these were
  already quite rare, so this process involved debugging several rare
  races, timeouts, and error handling bugs.).
* Fixed subtle bugs involving composing messages to deactivated users.
* Fixed subtle bugs with reloading the page while viewing settings
  with “Recent topics” as the default view.
* Fixed bug where pending email notifications could be lost when restarting
  the Zulip server.
* Fixed “require topics” setting not being enforced for API clients.

* Renamed “Night mode” to “Dark theme”.
* Added the mobile app’s notification sound to desktop sound options,
  as “Chime”.

## Zulip Server 4.x series[](#zulip-server-4-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 4.11[](#zulip-server-4-11 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-03-15*

* CVE-2022-24751: Zulip Server 4.0 and above were susceptible to a
  race condition during user deactivation, where a simultaneous access
  by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued
  access by the deactivated user. This access could theoretically
  continue until one of the following events happens:

  + The session expires from memcached; this defaults to two weeks, and
    is controlled by SESSION\_COOKIE\_AGE in /etc/zulip/settings.py
  + The session cache is evicted from memcached by other cached data.
  + The server is upgraded, which clears the cache.
* Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 4.10[](#zulip-server-4-10 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-02-25*

* CVE-2022-21706: Reusable invitation links could be improperly used
  for other organizations.
* CVE-2021-3967: Enforce that regenerating an API key must be done
  with an API key, not a cookie. Thanks to nhiephon
  (twitter.com/\_nhiephon) for their responsible disclosure of this
  vulnerability.
* Fixed a bug with the `reindex-textual-data` tool, where it would
  sometimes fail to find the libraries it needed.
* Pin PostgreSQL to 10.19, 11.14, 12.9, 13.5 or 14.1 to avoid a
  regression which caused deploys with PGroonga enabled to
  unpredictably fail database queries with the error
  `variable not found in subplan target list`.
* Fix ARM64 support; however, the wal-g binary is not yet supported on
  ARM64 (zulip/zulip#21070).

### Zulip Server 4.9[](#zulip-server-4-9 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2022-01-24*

* CVE-2021-43799: Remote execution of code involving RabbitMQ.
* Closed access to RabbitMQ port 25672; initial installs tried to
  close this port, but failed to restart RabbitMQ for the
  configuration.
* Removed the `rabbitmq.nodename` configuration in `zulip.conf`; all
  RabbitMQ instances will be reconfigured to have a nodename of
  `zulip@localhost`. You can remove this setting from your
  `zulip.conf` configuration file, if it exists.
* Added missing support for the Camo image proxy in the Docker
  image. This resolves a longstanding issue with image previews, if
  enabled, appearing as broken images for Docker-based installs.
* Fixed a bug which allowed a user to edit a message to add a wildcard
  mention when they did not have permissions to send such messages
  originally.
* Fixed a bug in the tool that corrects database corruption caused by
  updating the operating system hosting PostgreSQL, which previously
  omitted some indexes from its verification. If you updated the
  operating system of your Zulip instance from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04,
  or from Debian 9 to 10, you should run the tool,
  even if you did so previously; full details and instructions are
  available in the previous blog post.
* Began routing requests from the Camo image proxy through a
  non-Smokescreen proxy, if one is configured; because Camo includes
  logic to deny access to private subnets, routing its requests
  through Smokescreen is generally not necessary.
* Fixed a bug where changing the Camo secret required running
  `zulip-puppet-apply`.
* Fixed `scripts/setup/compare-settings-to-template` to be able to run
  from any directory.
* Switched Let’s Encrypt renewal to use its own timer, rather than our
  custom cron job. This fixes a bug where occasionally `nginx` would
  not reload after getting an updated certificate.
* Updated documentation and tooling to note that installs using
  `upgrade-zulip-from-git` require 3 GB of RAM, or 2 GB and at least 1
  GB of swap.

### Zulip Server 4.8[](#zulip-server-4-8 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-12-01*

* CVE-2021-43791: Zulip could fail to enforce expiration dates
  on confirmation keys, allowing users to potentially use expired
  invitations, self-registrations, or realm creation links.
* Began installing Smokescreen to harden Zulip against SSRF attacks by
  default. Zulip has offered Smokescreen as an option since Zulip
  4.0. Existing installs which configured an outgoing proxy which is
  not on `localhost:4750` will continue to use that; all other
  installations will begin having a Smokescreen installation listening
  on 127.0.0.1, which Zulip will proxy traffic through. The version of
  Smokescreen was also upgraded.
* Replaced the camo image proxy with go-camo, a maintained
  reimplementation that also protects against SSRF attacks. This
  server now listens only on 127.0.0.1 when it is deployed as part of
  a standalone deployment.
* Began using camo for images displayed in URL previews. This improves
  privacy and also resolves an issue where an image link to a third
  party server with an expired or otherwise invalid SSL certificate
  would trigger a confusing pop-up window for Zulip Desktop users.
* Fixed a bug which could cause Tornado to shut down improperly
  (causing an immediate full-page reload for their clients) when
  restarting a heavily loaded Zulip server.
* Updated Python dependencies.
* Truncated large “remove” mobile notification events so that marking
  hundreds of private messages or other notifiable messages as read at
  once won’t exceed Apple’s 4 KB notification size limit.
* Slack importer improvements:

  + Ensured that generated fake email addresses for Slack bots are
    unique.
  + Added support for importing Slack exports from a directory, not
    just a .zip file.
  + Provided better error messages with invalid Slack tokens.
  + Added support for non-ASCII Unicode folder names on Windows.
* Add support for V3 Pagerduty webhook.
* Updated documentation for Apache SSO, which now requires additional
  configuration now that Zulip uses a C extension (the `re2` module).
* Fixed a bug where an empty name in a SAML response would raise an
  error.
* Ensured that `deliver_scheduled_emails` and
  `deliver_scheduled_messages` did not double-deliver if run on
  multiple servers at once.
* Extended Certbot troubleshooting documentation.
* Fixed a bug in soft deactivation catch-up code, in cases where a
  race condition had created multiple subscription deactivation
  entries for a single user and single stream in the audit log.
* Updated translations, including adding a Sinhala translation.

### Zulip Server 4.7[](#zulip-server-4-7 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-10-04*

* CVE-2021-41115: Prevent organization administrators from affecting
  the server with a regular expression denial-of-service attack
  through linkifier patterns.

### Zulip Server 4.6[](#zulip-server-4-6 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-09-23*

* Documented official support for Debian 11 Bullseye, now that it is
  officially released by Debian upstream.
* Fixed installation on Debian 10 Buster. Upstream infrastructure had
  broken the Python `virtualenv` tool on this platform, which we’ve
  worked around for this release.
* Zulip releases are now distributed from https://download.zulip.com/server/,
  replacing the old `www.zulip.org` server.
* Added support for LDAP synchronization of the `is_realm_owner` and
  `is_moderator` flags.
* `upgrade-zulip-from-git` now uses `git fetch --prune`; this ensures
  `upgrade-zulip-from-git master` with return an error rather than
  using a stale cached version of the `master` branch, which was
  renamed to `main` this month.
* Added a new `reset_authentication_attempt_count` management command
  to allow sysadmins to manually reset authentication rate limits.
* Fixed a bug that caused the `upgrade-postgresql` tool to
  incorrectly remove `supervisord` configuration for `process-fts-updates`.
* Fixed a rare migration bug when upgrading from Zulip versions 2.1 and older.
* Fixed a subtle bug where the left sidebar would show both old and
  new names for some topics that had been renamed.
* Fixed incoming email gateway support for configurations
  with the `http_only` setting enabled.
* Fixed issues where Zulip’s outgoing webhook, with the
  Slack-compatible interface, had a different format from Slack’s
  documented interface.
* The installation and upgrade documentations now show the latest
  release’s version number.
* Backported many improvements to the ReadTheDocs documentation.
* Updated translation data from Transifex.

### Zulip Server 4.5[](#zulip-server-4-5 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-07-25*

* Added a tool to fix potential database corruption caused by host OS
  upgrades (was listed in 4.4 release notes, but accidentally omitted).

### Zulip Server 4.4[](#zulip-server-4-4 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-07-22*

* Fixed a possible denial-of-service attack in Markdown fenced code
  block parsing.
* Smokescreen, if installed, now defaults to only listening on
  127.0.0.1; this prevents it from being used as an open HTTP proxy if
  it did not have other firewalls protecting incoming port 4750.
* Fixed a performance/scalability issue for installations using the S3
  file uploads backend.
* Fixed a bug where users could turn other users’ messages they could
  read into widgets (e.g., polls).
* Fixed a bug where emoji and avatar image requests were sent through
  Camo; doing so does not add any security benefit, and broke custom
  emoji that had been imported from Slack in Zulip 1.8.1 or earlier.
* Changed to log just a warning, instead of an exception, in the case
  that the `embed_links` worker cannot fetch previews for all links in
  a message within the 30-second timeout. Each preview request within
  a message already has a 15-second timeout.
* Ensured `psycopg2` is installed before starting
  `process_fts_updates`; otherwise, it might fail to start several
  times before the package was installed.
* Worked around a bug in supervisor where, when using SysV init,
  `/etc/init.d/supervisor restart` would only have stopped, not
  restarted, the process.
* Modified upgrade scripts to better handle failure, and suggest next
  steps and point to logs.
* Zulip now hides the “show password” eye icon that IE and Edge
  browsers place in password inputs; this duplicated the
  already-present JavaScript-based functionality.
* Fixed “OR” glitch on login page if SAML authentication is enabled
  but not configured.
* The `send_test_email` management command now shows the full SMTP
  conversation on failure.
* Provided a `change_password` management command which takes a
  `--realm` option.
* Fixed `upgrade-zulip-from-git` crashing in CSS source map generation
  on 1-CPU systems.
* Added an `auto_signup` field in SAML configuration to auto-create
  accounts upon first login attempt by users which are authenticated
  by SAML.
* Provided better error messages when `puppet_classes` in `zulip.conf`
  are mistakenly space-separated instead of comma-separated.
* Updated translations for many languages.

### Zulip Server 4.3[](#zulip-server-4-3 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-06-02*

* Fixed exception when upgrading older servers with the
  `JITSI_SERVER_URL` setting set to `None` to disable Jitsi.
* Fixed GIPHY integration dropdown appearing when the server
  doesn’t have a GIPHY API key configured.
* The GIPHY API library is no longer loaded for users who are not
  actively using the GIPHY integration.

### Zulip Server 4.2[](#zulip-server-4-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-05-13*

* Fixed exception in purge-old-deployments when upgrading on
  a system that has never upgraded using Git.
* Fixed installation from a directory readable only by root.

### Zulip Server 4.1[](#zulip-server-4-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-05-13*

* Fixed exception upgrading to the 4.x series from older releases.

### Zulip Server 4.0[](#zulip-server-4-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-05-13*

#### Highlights[](#id11 "Link to this heading")

* Code blocks now have a copy-to-clipboard button and can be
  integrated with external code playgrounds, making it convenient to
  work with code while discussing it in Zulip.
* Added a new organization [Moderator role](https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions).
  Many permissions settings for sensitive features now support only
  allowing moderators and above to use the feature.
* Added a native Giphy integration for sending animated GIFs.
* Added support for muting another user.
* “Recent topics” is no longer beta, no longer an overlay, supports
  composing messages, and is now the default view. The previous
  default view, “All messages”, is still available, and the default
  view can now be configured via “Display settings”.
* Completed API documentation for Zulip’s real-time events system. It
  is now possible to write a decent Zulip client with minimal
  interaction with the Zulip server development team.
* Added new organization settings: wildcard mention policy.
* Integrated [Smokescreen](../production/deployment.html#customizing-the-outgoing-http-proxy), an outgoing proxy designed to
  help protect against SSRF attacks; outgoing HTTP requests that can
  be triggered by end users are routed through this service.
  We recommend that self-hosted installations configure it.
* This release contains more than 30 independent changes to the [Zulip
  API](https://zulip.com/api/changelog), largely to support new
  features or make the API (and thus its documentation) clearer and
  easier for clients to implement. Other new API features support
  better error handling for the mobile and terminal apps.
* The frontend internationalization library was switched from i18next
  to FormatJS.
* The button for replying was redesigned to show the reply recipient
  and be more obvious to users coming from other chat apps.
* Added support for moving topics to private streams, and for configuring
  which roles can move topics between streams.

#### Upgrade notes for 4.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-4-0 "Link to this heading")

* Changed the Tornado service to use 127.0.0.1:9800 instead of
  127.0.0.1:9993 as its default network address, to simplify support
  for multiple Tornado processes. Since Tornado only listens on
  localhost, this change should have no visible effect unless another
  service is using port 9800.
* Zulip’s top-level puppet classes have been renamed, largely from
  `zulip::foo` to `zulip::profile::foo`. Configuration referencing
  these `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf` will be automatically updated during
  the upgrade process, but if you have a complex deployment or you
  maintain `zulip.conf` is another system (e.g., with the [manual
  configuration](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip#manual-configuration) option for
  [docker-zulip](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip)), you’ll want to manually update the
  `puppet_classes` variable.
* Zulip’s supervisord configuration now lives in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/zulip/`
* Consider enabling [Smokescreen](../production/deployment.html#customizing-the-outgoing-http-proxy)
* Private streams can no longer be default streams (i.e. the ones new
  users are automatically added to).
* New `scripts/start-server` and `scripts/stop-server` mean that
  one no longer needs to use `supervisorctl` directly for these tasks.
* As this is a major release, we recommend [carefully updating the
  inline documentation in your
  `/etc/zulip/settings.py`](../production/upgrade.html#updating-settings-py-inline-documentation). Notably, we rewrote the
  template to be better organized and more readable in this release.
* The web app will now display a warning in the UI if the Zulip server
  has not been upgraded in more than 18 months.
  template to be better organized and more readable.
* The next time users log in to Zulip with their password after
  upgrading to this release, they will be logged out of all active
  browser sessions (i.e. the web and desktop apps). This is a side
  effect of improved security settings (increasing the minimum entropy
  used when salting passwords from 71 bits to 128 bits).
* We’ve removed the partial Thumbor integration from Zulip. The
  Thumbor project appears to be dead upstream, and we no longer feel
  comfortable including it in Zulip from a security perspective. We
  hope to introduce a fully supported thumbnailing integration in our next
  major release.

#### Full feature changelog[](#id12 "Link to this heading")

* Added new [release lifecycle documentation](release-lifecycle.html).

## Zulip Server 3.x series[](#zulip-server-3-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 3.4[](#zulip-server-3-4 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2021-04-14*

* CVE-2021-30487: Prevent administrators from moving topics to
  disallowed streams.
* CVE-2021-30479: Prevent guest user access to `all_public_streams`
  API.
* CVE-2021-30478: Prevent API super users from forging messages to
  other organizations.
* CVE-2021-30477: Prevent outgoing webhook bots from sending arbitrary
  messages to any stream.
* Fixed a potential HTML injection bug in outgoing emails.
* Fixed Postfix configuration error which would prevent outgoing email
  to any email address containing `.`, `+`, or starting with `mm`, when
  configured to use the local Postfix to deliver outgoing email.
* Fixed a backporting error which caused the
  `manage.py change_user_role` tool to not work for `admin`, `member`,
  or `guest` roles.
* Add support for logout events sent from modern versions of the
  desktop application.
* Upgraded minor python dependencies.
* Minor documentation fixes.

### Zulip Server 3.3[](#zulip-server-3-3 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2020-12-01*

* Guest users should not be allowed to post to streams marked “Only
  organization full members can post.” This flaw has existed since
  the feature was added in Zulip Server 3.0.
* Permit outgoing mail from postfix; this resolves a bug introduced in
  Zulip Server 3.2 which prevented Zulip from sending outgoing mail if
  the local mail server (used mostly for incoming mail) was also used
  for outgoing email (`MAIL_HOST='localhost'`).
* Ensure that the `upgrade-postgres` tool upgrades the cluster’s data
  to the specific PostgreSQL version requested; this resolves a bug
  where, now that PostgreSQL 13 has been released, `upgrade-postgres`
  would attempt to upgrade to that version and not PostgreSQL 12.
* Replace the impenetrably-named `./manage.py knight` with
  `./manage.py change_user_role`, and extend it to support
  “Organization owner” roles.
* Handle realm emojis that have been manually deleted more gracefully.

### Zulip Server 3.2[](#zulip-server-3-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2020-09-15*

* Switched from `libmemcached` to `python-binary-memcached`, a
  pure-Python implementation; this should eliminate memcached
  connection problems affecting some installations.
* Removed unnecessary `django-cookies-samesite` dependency, which had
  its latest release removed from PyPI (breaking installation of Zulip
  3.1).
* Limited which local email addresses Postfix accepts when the
  incoming email integration is enabled; this prevents the enumeration
  of local users via the email system.
* Fixed incorrectly case-sensitive email validation in `REMOTE_USER`
  authentication.
* Fixed search results for `has:image`.
* Fixed ability to adjust “Who can post on the stream” configuration.
* Fixed display of “Permission [to post] will be granted in n days”
  for n > 365.
* Support providing `nginx_listen_port` setting in conjunction with
  `http_only` in `zulip.conf`.
* Improved upgrade documentation.
* Removed internal ID lists which could leak into the events API.

### Zulip Server 3.1[](#zulip-server-3-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2020-07-30*

* Removed unused `short_name` field from the User model. This field
  had no purpose and could leak the local part of email addresses
  when email address visibility was restricted.
* Fixed a bug where loading spinners would sometimes not be displayed.
* Fixed incoming email gateway exception with unstructured headers.
* Fixed AlertWords not being included in data import/export.
* Fixed Twitter previews not including a clear link to the tweet.
* Fixed compose box incorrectly opening after uploading a file in a
  message edit widget.
* Fixed exception in SAML integration with encrypted assertions.
* Fixed an analytics migration bug that could cause upgrading from 2.x
  releases to fail.
* Added a Thinkst Canary integration (and renamed the old one, which
  was actually an integration for canarytokens.org).
* Reformatted the frontend codebase using prettier. This change was
  included in this maintenance release to ensure backporting patches
  from `main` remains easy.

### Zulip Server 3.0[](#zulip-server-3-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2020-07-16*

#### Highlights[](#id13 "Link to this heading")

* Added support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal. This release drops support
  for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch.
* Redesigned the top navbar/search area to be much cleaner and show
  useful data like subscriber counts and stream descriptions in
  default views.
* Added a new “Recent topics” widget, which lets one browse recent
  and ongoing conversations at a glance. We expect this widget to
  replace “All messages” as the default view in Zulip in the
  next major release.
* Redesigned “Notification settings” to have an intuitive table
  format and display any individual streams with non-default settings.
* Added support for moving topics between streams. This was by far
  Zulip’s most-requested feature.
* Added automatic theme detection using prefers-color-scheme.
* Added support for GitLab and Sign in with Apple authentication.
* Added an organization setting controlling who can use private messages.
* Added support for default stream groups, which allow organizations
  to offer options of sets of streams when new users sign up.
  Currently can only be managed via the Zulip API.
* The Zulip server now sets badge counts for the iOS mobile app.
* Quote-and-reply now generates a handy link to the quoted message.
* Upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x.
* Added integrations for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Alertmanager.
* Extended API documentation to have detailed data on most responses,
  validated against the API’s actual implementation and against all
  tests in our extensive automated test suite.
* Added support for programmable message retention policies, both a
  global/default policy and policies for specific streams.
* Added a new incoming webhook API that accepts messages in the format
  used by Slack’s incoming webhooks API.
* Introduced the Zulip API feature level, a concept that will greatly
  simplify the implementation of mobile, terminal, and desktop clients
  that need to talk to a wide range of supported Zulip server
  versions, as well as the [Zulip API
  changelog](https://zulip.com/api/changelog).
* Our primary official domain is now zulip.com, not zulipchat.com.

#### Upgrade notes for 3.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-3-0 "Link to this heading")

* Logged in users will be logged out during this one-time upgrade to
  transition them to more secure session cookies.
* This release contains dozens of database migrations, but we don’t
  anticipate any of them being particularly expensive compared to
  those in past major releases.
* Previous versions had a rare bug that made it possible to create two
  user accounts with the same email address, preventing either from
  logging in. A migration in this release adds a database constraint
  that will fix this bug. The new migration will fail if any such
  duplicate accounts already exist; you can check whether this will
  happen be running the following in a [management shell](../production/management-commands.html#manage-py-shell):

  ```
  from django.db.models.functions import Lower
  UserProfile.objects.all().annotate(email_lower=Lower("delivery_email"))
      .values('realm_id', 'email_lower').annotate(Count('id')).filter(id__count__gte=2)

  ```

  If the command returns any accounts, you need to address the
  duplicate accounts before upgrading. Zulip Cloud only had two
  accounts affected by this bug, so we expect the vast majority of
  installations will have none.
* This release switches Zulip to install PostgreSQL 12 from the upstream
  PostgreSQL repository by default, rather than using the default
  PostgreSQL version included with the operating system. Existing Zulip
  installations will continue to work with PostgreSQL 10; this detail is
  configured in `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf`. We have no concrete plans to
  start requiring PostgreSQL 12, though we do expect it to improve
  performance. Installations that would like to upgrade can follow
  [our new PostgreSQL upgrade guide](../production/upgrade.html#upgrading-postgresql).
* The format of the `JWT_AUTH_KEYS` setting has changed to include an
  [algorithms](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html)
  list: `{"subdomain": "key"}` becomes
  `{"subdomain": {"key": "key", "algorithms": ["HS256"]}}`.
* Added a new organization owner permission above the previous
  organization administrator. All existing organization
  administrators are automatically converted into organization owners.
  Certain sensitive administrative settings are now only
  editable by organization owners.
* The changelog now has a section that makes it easy to find the
  Upgrade notes for all releases one is upgrading across.

#### Full feature changelog[](#id14 "Link to this heading")

* Added new options in “Manage streams” to sort by stream activity or
  number of subscribers.
* Added new options to control whether the incoming email integration
  prefers converting the plain text or HTML content of an email.

  simpler interface.
* Normal users can now see invitations they sent via organization settings.
* Rewrote the Zoom video call integration.
* Polished numerous subtle elements of Zulip’s visual design.
* Dramatically improved the scalability of Zulip’s server-to-client
  push system, improving throughput by a factor of ~4.
* Improved handling of GitHub accounts with several email addresses.
* Improved “Manage streams” UI to clearly identify personal settings
  and use pills for adding new subscribers.
* Improved Sentry, Taiga, GitHub, GitLab, Semaphore, and many other integrations.
* Improved “Muted topics” UI to show when a topic was muted.
* Improved the UI for “Drafts” and “Message edit history” widgets.
* Improved left sidebar popovers to clearly identify administrative actions.
* Rewrote substantial parts of the Zulip installer to be more robust.
* Replaced the chevron menu indicators in sidebars with vertical ellipses.
* Removed the right sidebar “Group PMs” widget. It’s functionality is
  available in the left sidebar “Private messages” widget.
* Removed the Google Hangouts integration, due to Google’s support for
  it being discontinued.
* Removed a limitation on editing topics of messages more than a week old.
* The Gitter data import tool now supports importing multiple Gitter
  rooms into a single Zulip organization.
* Missed-message emails and various onboarding content are now tagged
  for translation.
* Redesigned the notice about large numbers of unread messages to be
  a banner (no longer a modal) and to use a better trigger.
* Cleaned up dozens of irregularities in how the Zulip API formats
  data when returning it to clients.
* Extended stream-level settings for who can post to a stream.
* Extended GET /messages API to support a more intuitive way to
  request the first unread or latest message as the anchor.
* Muted topics will now only appear behind “more topics”.
* Improved UI for picking which streams to invite new users to.
* Improved UI for reviewing one’s muted topics.
* Improved UI for message edit history.
* Fixed many minor issues with Zulip’s Markdown processors.
* Fixed many subtle issues with the message editing UI.
* Fixed several subtle issues with the default nginx configuration.
* Fixed minor issues with various keyboard shortcuts.
* Fixed UI bugs with Zulip’s image lightbox.
* Specifying `latex` or `text` as the language for a code block now
  does LaTeX syntax highlighting (`math` remains the recommended code
  block language to render LaTeX syntax into display math).
* Fixed performance problems when adding subscribers in organizations
  with thousands of streams.
* Fixed performance issues with typeahead and presence in
  organizations with 10,000s of total users.
* Fixed guest users being added to the notifications stream
  unconditionally.
* Fixed inconsistencies in the APIs for fetching users and streams.
* Fixed several subtle bugs with local echo in rare race conditions.

* Fixed subtle click-handler bugs with the mobile web UI.
* Improved defaults to avoid OOM kills on low RAM servers when running
  expensive tools like `webpack` or Slack import.
* Added loading indicators for scrolling downwards and fixed several
  subtle bugs with the message feed discovered as a result.

* Added webhook support for AnsibleTower 9.x.y.
* Essentially rewrote our API documentation using the OpenAPI format,
  with extensive validation to ensure its accuracy as we modify the API.
* Removed New User Bot and Feedback Bot. Messages they had sent are
  migrated to have been sent by Notification Bot.

  to 2012 that predated tracking unread messages in Zulip and has
  largely resulted in unexpected behavior for the last few years.
* Reduced visual size of emoji in message bodies for a cleaner look.
* Replaced file upload frontend with one supporting chunked upload.
  We expect this to enable uploading much larger files using Zulip in
  future releases.

* Modernized the codebase to use many Python 3.6 and ES6 patterns.
* Integrated isort, a tool which ensures that our Python codebase
  has clean, sorted import statements.
* Integrated PySA, a tool for detecting security bugs in Python
  codebases using the type-checker.
* Integrated semgrep, and migrated several regular expression based
  linter rules to use its Python syntax-aware parser.
* Added tooling to automatically generate all screenshots in
  integration docs.
* Restructured the backend for Zulip’s system administrator level
  settings system to be more maintainable.
* This release largely completes the SCSS refactoring of the codebase.
* Replaced our CasperJS frontend integration test system with Puppeteer.
* Extracted the typeahead and Markdown libraries for reuse in the
  mobile apps.
* Removed the legacy websockets-based system for sending messages. This
  system was always a hack, was only ever used for one endpoint, and
  did not provide a measurable latency benefit over HTTP/2.

#### Upgrade notes for 2.1.5[](#upgrade-notes-for-2-1-5 "Link to this heading")

Administrators of servers originally installed with Zulip 1.9 or older
should audit for unexpected [organization
administrators](https://zulip.com/help/change-a-users-role) following this upgrade, as it is
possible CVE-2020-14215 caused a user to incorrectly join as an
organization administrator in the past. See the release blog post for

*Released 2020-04-16*

* Fixed a regression in 2.1.3 that impacted creating the very first
  organization via our data import tools.
* Remove the old `tsearch_extras` PostgreSQL extension, which was causing
  an exception restoring backups on fresh Zulip servers that had been
  generated on systems that had been upgraded from older Zulip releases.
* Removed fetching GitHub contributor data from static asset build
  process. This makes `upgrade-zulip-from-git` much more reliable.

### Zulip Server 2.1.2[](#zulip-server-2-1-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2020-01-16*

* Corrected fix for CVE-2019-19775 (the original fix was affected by

* Fixed upgrading to 2.1.x with the LDAP integration enabled in a
  configuration where `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH` is newly
  required, but is not yet set.
* Reimplemented `--postgres-missing-dictionaries` installer option,
  used with our new support for a DBaaS managed database.
* Improved documentation for `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH`.

### Zulip Server 2.1.0[](#zulip-server-2-1-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2019-12-12*

#### Highlights[](#id15 "Link to this heading")

* Added support for Debian 10. Removed support for EOL Ubuntu 14.04.
* Added support for SAML authentication.
* Removed our dependency on `tsearch_extras`, making it possible to
  run a production Zulip server against any PostgreSQL database
  (including those where one cannot install extensions, like Amazon RDS).
* Significantly improved the email->Zulip gateway, and added [nice
  setup documentation](../production/email-gateway.html). It now
  should be possible to subscribe a Zulip stream to an email list and
  have a good experience.
* Added an option for hiding access to user email addresses from
  other users. While counterproductive for most corporate
  communities, for open source projects and other volunteer
  organizations, this can be a critical anti-spam feature.
* Added a new setting controlling which unread messages are counted in
  the favicon, title, and desktop app.
* Support for showing inline previews of linked webpages has moved
  from alpha to beta. See the upgrade notes below for some changes in
  how it is configured.
* Added support for importing an organization from Mattermost (similar
  to existing Slack/HipChat/Gitter import tools). Slack import now
  supports importing data only included in corporate exports,
  including private messages and shared channels.
* Added Markdown support and typeahead for mentioning topics.
* Email notifications have been completely redesigned with a minimal,
  readable style inspired by GitHub’s email notifications.
* We merged significant preparatory work for supporting RHEL/CentOS in
  production. We’re now interested in beta testers for this feature.
* Reorganized Zulip’s documentation for sysadmins, and added [new
  documentation](../production/modify.html)
  on maintaining a fork of Zulip.
* Added new `streams:public` search operator that searches the public
  history of all streams in the organization (even before you joined).
* Added support for sending email and mobile push notifications for
  wildcard mentions (@all and @everyone). Previously, they only
  triggered desktop notifications; now, that’s configurable.

#### Upgrade notes for 2.1.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-2-1-0 "Link to this heading")

* The defaults for Zulip’s now beta inline URL preview setting have changed.
  Previously, the server-level `INLINE_URL_EMBED_PREVIEW` setting was
  disabled, and organization-level setting was enabled. Now, the
  server-level setting is enabled by default, and the organization-level
  setting is disabled. As a result, organization administrators can
  configure this feature entirely in the UI. However, servers that had
  previously [enabled previews of linked
  websites](https://zulip.com/help/image-video-and-website-previews) will
  lose the setting and need to re-enable it.
* We rewrote the Google authentication backend to use the
  `python-social-auth` system we use for other third-party
  authentication systems. For this release, the old variable names
  still work, but users should update the following setting names in
  their configuration as we will desupport the old names in a future
  release:

  + In `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf`, `google_oauth2_client_secret`
    is now called with `social_auth_google_secret`.
  + In `/etc/zulip/settings.py`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` should be
    replaced with `SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_KEY`.
  + In `/etc/zulip/settings.py`, `GoogleMobileOauth2Backend` should
    be replaced with called `GoogleAuthBackend`.
* Installations using Zulip’s LDAP integration without
  `LDAP_APPEND_DOMAIN` will need to configure two new settings telling
  Zulip how to look up a user in LDAP given their email address:
  `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH` and `AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR`. See
  the [LDAP configuration
  instructions](../production/authentication-methods.html#ldap-including-active-directory)
  for details. You can use the usual `manage.py query_ldap` method to
  verify whether your configuration is working correctly.
* The Zulip web and desktop apps have been converted to directly count
  all unread messages, replacing an old system that just counted the
  (recent) messages fully fetched by the web app. This one-time
  transition may cause some users to notice old messages that were
  sent months or years ago “just became unread”. What actually
  happened is the user never read these messages, and the Zulip web app
  was not displaying that. Generally, the fix is for users to simply
  mark those messages as read as usual.
* Previous versions of Zulip’s installer would generate the secrets
  `local_database_password` and `initial_password_salt`. These
  secrets don’t do anything, as they only modify behavior of a Zulip
  development environment. We recommend deleting those lines from
  `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf` when you upgrade to avoid confusion.
* This release has a particularly expensive database migration,
  changing the `UserMessage.id` field from an `int` to a `bigint` to
  support more than 2 billion message deliveries on a Zulip server.
  It runs in 2 phases: A first migration that doesn’t require the
  server to be down (which took about 4 hours to process the 250M rows
  on chat.zulip.org, and a second migration that does require downtime
  (which took about 60 seconds for chat.zulip.org). You can check the
  number of rows for your server with `UserMessage.objects.count()`.

  We expect that most Zulip servers can happily just use the normal
  upgrade process with a few minutes of downtime. Zulip servers with
  over 1M messages may want to first upgrade to [this
  commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/b008515d63841e1c0a16ad868d3d67be3bfc20ca)
  using `upgrade-zulip-from-git`, following the instructions to avoid
  downtime, and then upgrade to the new release.

## Zulip Server 1.9.x series[](#zulip-server-1-9-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 1.9.2[](#zulip-server-1-9-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2019-01-29*

This release migrates Zulip off a deprecated Google+ API (necessary
for Google authentication to continue working past March 7), and

* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9 (our first non-Ubuntu
  platform!). We expect to deprecate support for installing a new
  Zulip server on Ubuntu 14.04 in the coming months, in preparation
  for Ubuntu 14.04’s end-of-life in April 2019.
* New data import tools for HipChat and Gitter. The Slack importer
  is now out of beta.
* Zulip Python process startup time is about 30% faster; this effort
  resulted in upstream contributions to fix significant performance
  bugs in django-bitfield, libthumbor, and pika.
* You can now configure custom (organization-specific) fields for user
  profiles; Zulip can now serve as your organization’s employee
  directory.
* Zulip now supports using Google Hangouts instead of Jitsi as the
  video chat provider.
* Users can now configure email and mobile push notifications for
  all messages in a stream (useful for low-traffic
  streams/organizations), not just for messages mentioning them.
* New [stream settings](https://zulip.com/help/channel-permissions#private-channels)
  control whether private stream subscribers can access history
  from before they joined, and allow configuring streams to only
  allow administrators to post.
* Zulip now has experimental support for guest users (intended
  for use cases like contractors who the organization only wants
  to have access to a few streams).
* New native integrations for Ansible Tower, Appveyor, Clubhouse,
  Netlify, and Zabbix; Zulip now has over 100 native integrations (in
  addition to hundreds more available via Zapier and IFTTT).
* New translations for Ukrainian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Dutch, and
  Finnish. Zulip now has complete or nearly-complete translations
  for German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian,
  Czech, Finnish, and Turkish. Partial translations for Chinese,
  Dutch, Korean, Polish, Japanese, and Indonesian cover the majority
  of the total strings in the project.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.9.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-1-9-0 "Link to this heading")

* Zulip 1.9 contains a significant database migration that can take
  several minutes to run. The upgrade process automatically minimizes
  disruption by running this migration first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime. However, if you’d like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  running them first manually
  as well as the usual trick of doing an apt upgrade first.

#### Full feature changelog[](#id20 "Link to this heading")

  organization administrators can remove users, edit descriptions, and
  rename private streams they are not subscribed to. See Zulip’s
  security model documentation for details.
* On Ubuntu 16.04, the local uploads backend now does the same security
  checks that the S3 backend did before serving files to users.

* Fixed numerous subtle bugs with the stream creation UI.
* Changes the URL scheme for stream narrows to encode the stream ID,
  so that they can be robust to streams being renamed. The change is
  backwards-compatible; existing narrow URLs still work.

**API, bots, and integrations:**

* Rewrote our API documentation to be much more friendly and
  expansive; it now covers most important endpoints, with nice examples.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.8.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-1-8-0 "Link to this heading")

This major release has no special upgrade notes.

## Zulip Server 1.7.x series[](#zulip-server-1-7-x-series "Link to this heading")

### Zulip Server 1.7.2[](#zulip-server-1-7-2 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2018-04-12*

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.1. All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

* CVE-2018-9986: Fix XSS issues with frontend Markdown processor.
* CVE-2018-9987: Fix XSS issue with muting notifications.
* CVE-2018-9990: Fix XSS issue with stream names in topic typeahead.
* CVE-2018-9999: Fix XSS issue with user uploads. The fix for this
  adds a Content-Security-Policy for the `LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR` storage
  backend for user-uploaded files.

Thanks to Suhas Sunil Gaikwad for reporting CVE-2018-9987 and w2w for
reporting CVE-2018-9986 and CVE-2018-9990.

### Zulip Server 1.7.1[](#zulip-server-1-7-1 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2017-11-21*

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.0. All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

This release includes fixes for the upgrade process, so server admins
running a version from before 1.7 should upgrade directly to 1.7.1.

* CVE-2017-0910: On a server with multiple realms, a vulnerability in
  the invitation system allowed an authorized user of one realm to
  create an account on any other realm.
* The Korean translation is now complete, a huge advance from almost
  nothing in 1.7.0. The French translation is now nearly complete,
  and several other languages have smaller updates.
* The installer now sets LC\_ALL to a known locale, working around an
  issue where some dependencies fail to install in some locales.
* We fixed a bug in the script that runs after upgrading Zulip (so
  the fix applies when upgrading to this version), where the
  garbage-collection of old deployments sometimes wouldn’t preserve
  the immediate last deployment.

### Zulip Server 1.7.0[](#zulip-server-1-7-0 "Link to this heading")

*Released 2017-10-25*

#### Highlights[](#id22 "Link to this heading")

**Web**

* We’ve completely redesigned our onboarding process to explain Zulip,
  and especially topics, to new users.
* We’ve built a beautiful new emoji picker with categories, a
  showcase, and much better data. Note the clean, underscore-free
  display!
* The emails sent by Zulip are more consistent, readable, and visually
  interesting.
* Chinese (Simplified) and Japanese join Spanish, German, and Czech in
  having the user interface fully translated, in addition to partial
  translations for many other languages. We also fixed many small
  issues where strings weren’t tagged for translation.
* Many pages have been redesigned to be easier to use and visually
  cleaner, including the settings pages and the user documentation at
  /help, /integrations, and /apps.

**Mobile and Desktop support**

* Zulip Server 1.7 adds several new APIs that are critical for mobile
  app performance and that let the app track unread messages. If
  you’re using the mobile apps at all (iOS or Android), you will
  definitely want to upgrade to Zulip 1.7.
* The iOS and Android apps can receive push notifications
  (configurable, naturally) for events like PMs and @-mentions. While
  Zulip Server 1.6 has basic support for these, 1.7 brings a new,
  clearer format to notifications, and gives each user more options
  for finer-grained control.
* The new Electron desktop app is out of beta and replaces our legacy
  desktop apps.

**Backend and scaling**

* Zulip now runs exclusively on Python 3. This is the culmination of
  an 18-month migration effort. We are very excited about this!
* We’ve added an automatic “soft deactivation” process, which
  dramatically improves performance for organizations with a large
  number of inactive users, without any impact on those users’
  experience if they later come back.
* Zulip’s performance at scale has improved significantly. Performance
  now scales primarily with number of active users (not total
  users). As an example, chat.zulip.org serves 400 monthly active
  users and about 3500 total users, on one VM with just 8GB of RAM and
  a CPU consistently over 90% idle.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.7.0[](#upgrade-notes-for-1-7-0 "Link to this heading")

* Zulip 1.7 contains some significant database migrations that can
  take several minutes to run. The upgrade process automatically
  minimizes disruption by running these first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime. However, if you’d like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  running them first manually
  as well as the usual trick of doing an apt upgrade first.
* We’ve removed support for an uncommon legacy deployment model where
  a Zulip server served multiple organizations on the same domain.
  Installs with multiple organizations now require each organization
  to have its own subdomain.

  This change should have no effect for the vast majority of Zulip
  servers that only have one organization. If you manage a server
  that hosts multiple organizations, you’ll want to read [our guide on
  multiple organizations](../production/multiple-organizations.html).
* We simplified the configuration for our password strength checker to
  be much more intuitive. If you were using the
  `PASSWORD_MIN_ZXCVBN_QUALITY` setting,
  [it has been replaced](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/a116303604e362796afa54b5d923ea5312b2ea23) by
  the more intuitive `PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES`.
