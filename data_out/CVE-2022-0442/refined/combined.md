## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# UsersWP < 1.2.3.1 - Subscriber+ User Avatar Override

### Description

The plugin is missing access controls when updating a user avatar, and does not make sure file names for user avatars are unique, allowing a logged in user to overwrite another users avatar.

### Proof of Concept

- Right click the thumbnail of another user and copy the image URL. It will be something like: wp-content/uploads/2022/02/myprofilepic\_uwp\_avatar\_thumb.png.
- Create a local file called myprofilepic.png, and upload it as your new profile photo.
- Go check the other user again, and it should now have your profile photo.
