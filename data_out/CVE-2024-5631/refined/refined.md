Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-5631:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Longse NVR (Network Video Recorder) model NVR3608PGE2W transmits user login credentials (username and password) to a remote control service without encryption. This occurs when a user changes their password through the router's portal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319)
- Lack of encryption for credentials during transmission.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An on-path attacker can eavesdrop on the network traffic and capture the user's login credentials.
- The attacker can then use the stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to the video stream from the NVR.

**Attack vectors:**
- On-path network attack
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network communication between the NVR and the remote control service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic, meaning they must be on the same network segment or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- No specific technical expertise is needed beyond the ability to intercept network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Longse NVR model NVR3608PGE2W.
- The vendor has stated that the product has reached its end-of-life phase and will not receive patches.
- Other devices based on this NVR, such as Zamel ZMB-01/ZMB-01C, are also vulnerable.
