Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6484

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Bootstrap 3 Carousel component. Specifically, the improper handling of the `href` attribute within anchor (`<a>`) elements used for carousel navigation.
- When a carousel navigation anchor element has a `data-slide` or `data-slide-to` attribute but lacks a valid `data-target="#someCarouselId"`, the `href` attribute value is not properly sanitized.
-  The component fails to properly extract the intended target carousel's ID from the `href` attribute. This leads to the click event's `preventDefault()` function not being applied which can cause the `href` to be evaluated and executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Because the `href` attribute is not sanitized, a malicious script can be injected into the `href` and will be executed when clicked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user clicks on a specially crafted carousel navigation link.
-  This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted anchor elements (`<a>`) within a Bootstrap 3 carousel.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious code within the `href` attribute of a carousel navigation anchor, while ensuring that `data-target` attribute is missing or invalid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious HTML code into a webpage that uses Bootstrap 3 carousel component. This could be achieved by:
     - Directly modifying a website's source code if the attacker has access.
     - Injecting the malicious code through a vulnerable application (e.g., through a comment section or other user input).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Bootstrap versions 2.0.0 through 3.4.1.
- HeroDevs has released a patch in their "Never-Ending Support" (NES) version of Bootstrap 3 (version 3.4.5).
- The fix sanitizes the `href` attribute values, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
- The content includes a proof-of-concept and links to online examples.
