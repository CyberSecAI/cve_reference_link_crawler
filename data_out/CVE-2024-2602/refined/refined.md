- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to tamper with a saved project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). The software does not properly restrict file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially include malicious DLLs in accessible directories and execute them.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, potentially leading to denial of service or unauthorized access to system functions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to tamper with a saved project file. An authenticated user then has to execute the tampered project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to write to the file system where the FoxRTU Station is installed.
    - The attacker needs to create a malicious project file that leverages the path traversal vulnerability, or inject a malicious DLL file into an accessible directory used by the software.
    - The attacker needs an authenticated user to execute the malicious project file.
