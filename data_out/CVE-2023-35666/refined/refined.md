{
  "CVE-2023-35666": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises because `bta_av_rc_msg` does not handle a null browse packet properly. Instead of respecting the handling for a null browse packet, it dispatches the null pointer to `bta_av_rc_free_browse_msg`. Although this doesn't directly cause a Use-After-Free (UAF) because `osi_free_and_reset` identifies the null pointer and aborts, it leads to an unexpected program termination.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null pointers",
      "Incorrect dispatch of null browse packet"
    ],
    "Impact": "Improper program termination (abort) when a null browse packet is received.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted null browse packet via Bluetooth.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to send a Bluetooth browse packet (proximal/adjacent)"
  }
