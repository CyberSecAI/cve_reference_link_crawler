Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2024-41080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `io_register_iowq_max_workers()` function in the Linux kernel's io_uring subsystem calls `io_put_sq_data()`, which acquires the `sqd->lock` without releasing the `uring_lock`. This incorrect lock acquisition order can lead to a potential deadlock situation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a deadlock caused by improper lock ordering. Specifically, `uring_lock` is held when trying to acquire `sqd->lock`, whereas `sqd->lock` might be held by another thread trying to acquire `uring_lock`, leading to a deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a system deadlock, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised process calling the `io_register_iowq_max_workers()` function in a way that triggers the described lock ordering issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make system calls to `io_uring` with the capability to register an IOWQ and set the max workers. This means the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the system.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes multiple instances of the fix being applied to different kernel versions, all referencing the same root cause and resolution. The fix involves releasing the `uring_lock` before acquiring the `sqd->lock` and then reacquiring it, ensuring the locks are acquired in a correct order.
