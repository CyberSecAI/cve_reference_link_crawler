- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of risky cryptographic algorithms within Dell PowerScale OneFS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system employs cryptographic algorithms that are considered weak or outdated, making them susceptible to exploitation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to full system access for the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges and can be remote. The attacker needs to be able to connect to the system over the network.
