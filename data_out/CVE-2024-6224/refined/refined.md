- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection in certain areas and fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the context of the administrator's browser when they access the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or further attacks on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form with hidden input fields containing XSS payloads. This form is then delivered to the victim (a logged-in administrator). When the admin opens this form, the form is automatically submitted via JavaScript and the malicious payload is saved in the plugin settings due to the missing CSRF protection and lack of sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML file.
