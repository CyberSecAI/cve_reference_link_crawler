Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** in the WP Easy Gallery plugin. Specifically, several AJAX actions such as `wpeg_settings` and `wpeg_add_gallery` do not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform these actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of capability checks for AJAX actions related to gallery manipulation. This allows any authenticated user (with subscriber-level access or higher) to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators or users with specific roles.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin's AJAX implementation doesn't properly validate user roles or capabilities before executing sensitive functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Gallery Modification:** An attacker with minimal privileges (subscriber level or higher) can modify existing galleries, potentially defacing content, injecting malicious code, or disrupting functionality.
- **Settings Manipulation**: An attacker can modify plugin settings, potentially impacting the plugin's functionality or causing unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **AJAX API:** The attacker leverages AJAX actions to access and modify gallery settings without appropriate authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access. No special privileges are required beyond being a logged-in user.
- **Knowledge of AJAX endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the names of vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
The WP Easy Gallery plugin fails to properly authorize users before allowing them to access and modify gallery settings and create new galleries, allowing low-privileged authenticated users to perform actions they should not be able to, thus leading to potential site defacement and other malicious activities.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided code snippet highlights the plugin's AJAX action hooks and the `check_ajax_referer()` calls. However, it also indicates that capability checks are absent in the mentioned AJAX functions (`wpeg_settings`, `wpeg_add_gallery`).
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.8.5.
- No patch is currently available.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description which simply states that there is a missing authorization issue.
