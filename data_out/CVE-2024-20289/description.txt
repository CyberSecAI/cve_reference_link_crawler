A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.&nbsp;

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments for a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
