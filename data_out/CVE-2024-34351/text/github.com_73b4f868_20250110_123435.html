Improve redirection handling ([#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561))

```
Currently to redirect to another RSC route of the same app, we initiate
another request to that route. This PR changes that request to directly
use the internal hostname of the current server handler, rather than
relying on other headers.

Closes [NEXT-2614](https://linear.app/vercel/issue/NEXT-2614)
