### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>grafbase/pathfinder (@&#8203;pathfinder-ide/react)</summary>

###
[`v0.7.1`](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/blob/HEAD/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md#071)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/compare/@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.0...@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.1)

##### Patch Changes

- [`bb36561`](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/commit/bb36561):
Remove zIndex from active tab indicator. The zIndex doesn't effect its
visibility in the Pathfinder UI and this element tends to show in front
of UI that is overlayed on top of Pathfinder when integrated in other
applications.

</details>

<details>
<summary>urql-graphql/urql (@&#8203;urql/core)</summary>

###
[`v4.3.0`](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/blob/HEAD/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md#430)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/compare/@urql/core@4.2.3...@urql/core@4.3.0)

##### Minor Changes

- Support [Apollo Federation's
format](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/)
for subscription results in `multipart/mixed` responses (result
properties essentially are namespaced on a `payload` key)
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock)
(See [#&#8203;3499](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3499))
- Add support for sending persisted documents. Any `DocumentNode` with
no/empty definitions and a `documentId` property is considered a
persisted document. When this is detected a `documentId` parameter
rather than a `query` string is sent to the GraphQL API, similar to
Automatic Persisted Queries (APQs). However, APQs are only supported via
`@urql/exchange-persisted`, while support for `documentId` is now
built-in
Submitted by [@&#8203;kitten](https://togithub.com/kitten) (See
[#&#8203;3515](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3515))

##### Patch Changes

- Allow `url` to be a plain, non-URL pathname (i.e. `/api/graphql`) to
be used with `preferGetMethod`
Submitted by [@&#8203;akrantz01](https://togithub.com/akrantz01) (See
[#&#8203;3514](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3514))
-   Correctly support the `Headers` class being used in `fetchOptions`
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock)
(See [#&#8203;3505](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3505))

###
[`v0.22.0`](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/HEAD/RELEASE-NOTES.md#0220)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/compare/v0.21.7...v0.22.0)

- `DecodeSliceError::OutputSliceTooSmall` is now conservative rather
than precise. That is, the error will only occur if the decoded output
*cannot* fit, meaning that `Engine::decode_slice` can now be used with
exactly-sized output slices. As part of this, `Engine::internal_decode`
now returns `DecodeSliceError` instead of `DecodeError`, but that is not
expected to affect any external callers.
- `DecodeError::InvalidLength` now refers specifically to the *number of
valid symbols* being invalid (i.e. `len % 4 == 1`), rather than just the
number of input bytes. This avoids confusing scenarios when based on
interpretation you could make a case for either `InvalidLength` or
`InvalidByte` being appropriate.
-   Decoding is somewhat faster (5-10%)

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>grafbase/pathfinder (@&#8203;pathfinder-ide/react)</summary>

###
[`v0.7.1`](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/blob/HEAD/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md#071)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/compare/@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.0...@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.1)

##### Patch Changes

- [`bb36561`](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/commit/bb36561):
Remove zIndex from active tab indicator. The zIndex doesn't effect its
visibility in the Pathfinder UI and this element tends to show in front
of UI that is overlayed on top of Pathfinder when integrated in other
applications.

<summary>urql-graphql/urql (@&#8203;urql/core)</summary>

###
[`v4.3.0`](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/blob/HEAD/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md#430)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/compare/@urql/core@4.2.3...@urql/core@4.3.0)

##### Minor Changes

- Support [Apollo Federation's
format](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/)
for subscription results in `multipart/mixed` responses (result
properties essentially are namespaced on a `payload` key)
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock)
(See [#&#8203;3499](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3499))
- Add support for sending persisted documents. Any `DocumentNode` with
no/empty definitions and a `documentId` property is considered a
persisted document. When this is detected a `documentId` parameter
rather than a `query` string is sent to the GraphQL API, similar to
Automatic Persisted Queries (APQs). However, APQs are only supported via
`@urql/exchange-persisted`, while support for `documentId` is now
built-in
Submitted by [@&#8203;kitten](https://togithub.com/kitten) (See
[#&#8203;3515](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3515))

##### Patch Changes

- Allow `url` to be a plain, non-URL pathname (i.e. `/api/graphql`) to
be used with `preferGetMethod`
Submitted by [@&#8203;akrantz01](https://togithub.com/akrantz01) (See
[#&#8203;3514](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3514))
-   Correctly support the `Headers` class being used in `fetchOptions`
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock)
(See [#&#8203;3505](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3505))

[`v0.22.0`](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/HEAD/RELEASE-NOTES.md#0220)

[Compare
Source](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/compare/v0.21.7...v0.22.0)

- `DecodeSliceError::OutputSliceTooSmall` is now conservative rather
than precise. That is, the error will only occur if the decoded output
*cannot* fit, meaning that `Engine::decode_slice` can now be used with
exactly-sized output slices. As part of this, `Engine::internal_decode`
now returns `DecodeSliceError` instead of `DecodeError`, but that is not
expected to affect any external callers.
- `DecodeError::InvalidLength` now refers specifically to the *number of
valid symbols* being invalid (i.e. `len % 4 == 1`), rather than just the
number of input bytes. This avoids confusing scenarios when based on
interpretation you could make a case for either `InvalidLength` or
`InvalidByte` being appropriate.
-   Decoding is somewhat faster (5-10%)

<summary>grafbase/pathfinder (@&#8203;pathfinder-ide/react)</summary>

###
[`v0.7.1`](<https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/blob/HEAD/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md#071>)

[Compare
Source]([https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/compare/@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.0...@pathfinder-ide/react@0.7.1](https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/compare/%40pathfinder-ide/react%400.7.0...%40pathfinder-ide/react%400.7.1))

##### Patch Changes

- [`bb36561`](<https://togithub.com/grafbase/pathfinder/commit/bb36561>):
Remove zIndex from active tab indicator. The zIndex doesn't effect its
visibility in the Pathfinder UI and this element tends to show in front
of UI that is overlayed on top of Pathfinder when integrated in other
applications.

###
[`v4.3.0`](<https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/blob/HEAD/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md#430>)

[Compare
Source]([https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/compare/@urql/core@4.2.3...@urql/core@4.3.0](https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/compare/%40urql/core%404.2.3...%40urql/core%404.3.0))

##### Minor Changes

- Support [Apollo Federation's
format](<https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/>)
for subscription results in `multipart/mixed` responses (result
properties essentially are namespaced on a `payload` key)
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](<https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock>)
(See [#&#8203;3499](<https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3499>))
- Add support for sending persisted documents. Any `DocumentNode` with
no/empty definitions and a `documentId` property is considered a
persisted document. When this is detected a `documentId` parameter
rather than a `query` string is sent to the GraphQL API, similar to
Automatic Persisted Queries (APQs). However, APQs are only supported via
`@urql/exchange-persisted`, while support for `documentId` is now
built-in
Submitted by [@&#8203;kitten](<https://togithub.com/kitten>) (See
[#&#8203;3515](<https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3515>))

##### Patch Changes

- Allow `url` to be a plain, non-URL pathname (i.e. `/api/graphql`) to
be used with `preferGetMethod`
Submitted by [@&#8203;akrantz01](<https://togithub.com/akrantz01>) (See
[#&#8203;3514](<https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3514>))
-   Correctly support the `Headers` class being used in `fetchOptions`
Submitted by [@&#8203;JoviDeCroock](<https://togithub.com/JoviDeCroock>)
(See [#&#8203;3505](<https://togithub.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3505>))

[`v0.22.0`](<https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/HEAD/RELEASE-NOTES.md#0220>)

[Compare
Source](<https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/compare/v0.21.7...v0.22.0>)

- `DecodeSliceError::OutputSliceTooSmall` is now conservative rather
than precise. That is, the error will only occur if the decoded output
*cannot* fit, meaning that `Engine::decode_slice` can now be used with
exactly-sized output slices. As part of this, `Engine::internal_decode`
now returns `DecodeSliceError` instead of `DecodeError`, but that is not
expected to affect any external callers.
- `DecodeError::InvalidLength` now refers specifically to the *number of
valid symbols* being invalid (i.e. `len % 4 == 1`), rather than just the
number of input bytes. This avoids confusing scenarios when based on
interpretation you could make a case for either `InvalidLength` or
`InvalidByte` being appropriate.
-   Decoding is somewhat faster (5-10%)

# Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions

High

[jackwilson323](/jackwilson323)
published
GHSA-fr5h-rqp8-mj6g
May 9, 2024

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=13.4 <14.1.1

## Patched versions

14.1.1

## Description

### Impact

A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions by security researchers at Assetnote. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself.

#### Prerequisites

* Next.js (`<14.1.1`) is running in a self-hosted\* manner.
* The Next.js application makes use of Server Actions.
* The Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`.

\* Many hosting providers (including Vercel) route requests based on the Host header, so we do not believe that this vulnerability affects any Next.js applications where routing is done in this manner.

### Patches

This vulnerability was patched in [#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561) and fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.

### Workarounds

There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to Next.js `14.1.1`.

### Credit

Vercel and the Next.js team thank Assetnote for responsibly disclosing this issue to us, and for working with us to verify the fix. Thanks to:

Adam Kues - Assetnote

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Improve redirection handling ([#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561))

```
Currently to redirect to another RSC route of the same app, we initiate
another request to that route. This PR changes that request to directly
use the internal hostname of the current server handler, rather than
relying on other headers.

Closes [NEXT-2614](https://linear.app/vercel/issue/NEXT-2614)
