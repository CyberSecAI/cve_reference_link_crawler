Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-30293:

**Root Cause:**
A memory corruption issue, specifically a heap-buffer-overflow, in the `WebCore::TextureMapperLayer::setContentsLayer` function. This occurs due to a race condition where a `TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxyGL` is destroyed, but `invalidate` has not been called, leaving a dangling pointer to a released layer, leading to a use-after-free when the proxy is later accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow
- Use-after-free

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution
- Denial of Service (application crash)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious web content.
- Victim must load the malicious web content in a vulnerable browser or application using WebKitGTK or WPE WebKit.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs when a `WebGLRenderingContext` instance is created and destroyed. This context is attached to a `CoordinatedGraphicsLayer` as its `PlatformLayer`. The compositor thread uses a proxy for this `PlatformLayer` which is activated by the `TextureMapperLayer`. Normally, when a `WebGLRenderingContext` is destroyed the associated `CoordinatedGraphicsLayer` is also destroyed and the compositor calls `invalidate` on the proxy. However, under certain conditions (likely due to a race condition), the `PlatformLayer` is detached from the `CoordinatedGraphicsLayer` while the associated `GraphicsLayer` remains alive. This results in the compositor not calling `invalidate`. The proxy's reference is overwritten when the scene state is updated with a null `PlatformLayer`, losing the chance to call `invalidate`.  If the `TextureMapperLayer` is deleted before the proxy the use after free occurs during proxy deletion. A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within `setContentsLayer`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before versions 2.36.1.
- The issue is triggered by detaching the `PlatformLayer` from the `CoordinatedGraphicsLayer` while keeping the `GraphicsLayer` alive, leading to a race condition during the destruction of layers and their proxies.
- The vulnerability can be triggered within 3-4 seconds after loading the malicious HTML page.
- The patch involves ensuring that the invalidate function is called on the proxy before it is deallocated
- This issue does not affect Apple platforms as it is specific to the WPE and GTK ports of WebKit
- Both CVE-2022-30293 and CVE-2022-30294 refer to the same underlying issue.
