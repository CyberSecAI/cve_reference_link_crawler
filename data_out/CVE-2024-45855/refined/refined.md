{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of `pickle.loads` within the `finetune` method of the `ModelWrapperUnsafe` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vector": "An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious pickle object through the 'Upload Custom Model' feature in the MindsDB UI. This malicious object is then deserialized when the `finetune` method is called, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to a MindsDB instance and needs to be able to upload a custom model via the 'Upload Custom Model' feature. This requires changing the BYOM engine to ‘inhouse’ in the MindsDB config.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs when the finetune query is used. When a model is trained, it is serialized along with the malicious pickle object via `pickle.dumps` in the train method. When a finetune query is run, the vulnerable `finetune` method calls `pickle.loads` on the model, deserializing the malicious payload. This issue is present in MindsDB versions v23.10.2.0 or newer."
