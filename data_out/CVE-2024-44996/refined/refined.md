Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from a recursive call to the `recvmsg` function within the vsock module when a vsock socket is added to a BPF sockmap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Recursive Function Calls:** The core issue is that `vsock_bpf_recvmsg()` can call `__vsock_recvmsg()`, which in turn calls `vsock_connectible_recvmsg()`. This function then attempts to invoke the original `prot->recvmsg()`, which was replaced by `vsock_bpf_recvmsg()`, creating a recursive loop.
- **Incorrect Function Pointer Handling:** When a vsock socket is added to a BPF sockmap, the original `recvmsg` function pointer is replaced with `vsock_bpf_recvmsg()`. However, the original pointer isn't preserved and correctly invoked, leading to the recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The recursive calls to `recvmsg` can lead to a stack overflow and crash the kernel, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **BPF Sockmap:**  The attack requires the ability to add a vsock socket to a BPF sockmap, which is often privileged.
- **Vsock Socket:** A vsock socket is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:**  The attacker needs sufficient privileges to create and manipulate BPF sockmaps.
- **Vsock Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with vsock sockets.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involves modifying `__vsock_recvmsg()` to call the original `recvmsg` without any BPF sockmap logic. This is achieved by introducing helper functions `__vsock_connectible_recvmsg` and `__vsock_dgram_recvmsg` which directly call the transport dequeue function and avoid the recursion. Additionally the original recvmsg function pointer is used if BPF is not enabled on the socket.

This commit addresses the issue by preventing recursive calls by using the original transport function call.
