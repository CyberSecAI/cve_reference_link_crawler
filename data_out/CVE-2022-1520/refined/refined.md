- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When viewing an email message (A) with an attached encrypted/signed message (B), Thunderbird may incorrectly show the security status of B when returning to the display of message A.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect security status display.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user might be misled about the security status of email message A, potentially leading to a false sense of security or a missed security issue if message A was not actually encrypted or signed.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by viewing an email with an encrypted or signed attachment, and then returning to view the original email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to send a specially crafted email with an encrypted or signed attachment. The user must then view both the original email and the attachment to trigger the vulnerability.
