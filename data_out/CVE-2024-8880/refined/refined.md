  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of parameters in the password recovery function of playSMS 1.4.3. Specifically, the 'username' parameter is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the 'username' parameter of the password recovery functionality.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/playsms/index.php?app=main&inc=core_auth&route=forgot&op=forgot` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the 'username' parameter with a template injection payload.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for exploitation."
