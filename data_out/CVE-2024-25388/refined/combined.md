| Hi,  I would like to report another potential vulnerability in the current version of RT-Thread. Please let me know if you plan to ask for a CVE ID in case the vulnerability is confirmed. I'm available if you need further clarifications. Potential heap buffer overflow in RT-Thread wlan driverSummary I spotted a potential heap buffer overflow vulnerability at the following location in the RT-Thread wlan driver source code: <https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/drivers/wlan/wlan_mgnt.c#L215-L226> Details Since `len` is a signed integer in the `rt_wlan_send_to_thread()`function, a small negative value could lead to a buffer overflow at the marked lines:  ``` #ifdef RT_WLAN_WORK_THREAD_ENABLE ... static rt_err_t rt_wlan_send_to_thread(rt_wlan_event_t event, void *buff, int len) {     struct rt_wlan_msg *msg;      RT_WLAN_LOG_D("F:%s is run event:%d", __FUNCTION__, event);      /* Event packing */     msg = rt_malloc(sizeof(struct rt_wlan_msg) + len); /* VULN: if len is a small negative number, this would result in an under-allocation */     if (msg == RT_NULL)     {         RT_WLAN_LOG_E("wlan mgnt send msg err! No memory");         return -RT_ENOMEM;     }     rt_memset(msg, 0, sizeof(struct rt_wlan_msg) + len);     msg->event = event;     if (len != 0)     {         msg->buff = (void *)&msg[1];         rt_memcpy(msg->buff, buff, len); /* VULN: the small negative number would become a large unsigned size, and we would have a wild memcpy and a heap buffer overflow */         msg->len = len;     }      /* send event to wlan thread */     if (rt_wlan_workqueue_dowork(rt_wlan_mgnt_work, msg) != RT_EOK)     {         rt_free(msg);         RT_WLAN_LOG_E("wlan mgnt do work fail");         return -RT_ERROR;     }     return RT_EOK; } ``` Impact If the signed size above is confirmed to be attacker-controlled and the input is crossing a security boundary, the impact of the reported buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. |

| Hi, it's been one month since I reported this vulnerability, and I wanted to ask if you have any update. As standard practice, I plan to request a CVE ID for every confirmed vulnerability. I also intend to publish an advisory by February at the latest, unless there's a specific reason to postpone. Thanks! |

### Multiple vulnerabilities in RT-Thread RTOS

### Summary

Welcome to another episode in [my journey](https://security.humanativaspa.it/ost2-zephyr-rtos-and-a-bunch-of-cves/) as a glorified static analysis tool for real-time operating systems!

This time, our target of choice is [RT-Thread](https://www.rt-thread.io/), an open-source, community-based **real-time operating system (RTOS)**. RT-Thread can be used in sensing nodes, wireless connection chips, and many other resource-constrained scenarios. It is also widely applied in gateways, IPC, smart speakers, and other high-performance **IoT applications**.

I reviewed RT-Thread’s [source code](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread) hosted on GitHub and identified multiple **security vulnerabilities** that may cause memory corruption and security feature bypass. Their impacts range from **denial of service** to potential **arbitrary code execution**.

During the source code review I also audited the [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) and [TinyDir](https://github.com/cxong/tinydir) codebases on which some RT-Thread functionalities depend, and found [some](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=ee1523630a81fffa6b7d93dd0c7a6191de5856cd) [additional](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=b413b040936f48d4cd9ed632ac579542c710efae) [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/cxong/tinydir/security/advisories/GHSA-jf5r-wgf4-qhxf) that were subsequently fixed by the respective maintainers.

My detailed **advisories** are available here:

* <https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2024-05-rt-thread.txt>
* <https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2023-04-tinydir.txt>

### Background

After my [recent vulnerability disclosures](https://security.humanativaspa.it/ost2-zephyr-rtos-and-a-bunch-of-cves/), I decided to keep assisting open-source projects in the IoT space in finding and fixing security vulnerabilities by **reviewing their source code**. RT-Thread was selected as a target of interest. Other RTOSes will be featured in future [advisories](https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns) and writeups. So, [stay tuned](https://security.humanativaspa.it/tag/iot/).

During this review, I made use of my [Semgrep C/C++ ruleset](https://security.humanativaspa.it/semgrep-ruleset-for-c-c-vulnerability-research/) to identify hotspots in code on which to focus my attention. I also took advantage of this opportunity to [improve and update](https://security.humanativaspa.it/big-update-to-my-semgrep-c-cpp-ruleset/) the ruleset.

### Vulnerabilities

The **vulnerabilities** resulting from my source code review are:

* [CVE-2024-24335](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues/8271) – Buffer overflow in RT-Thread dfs\_v2 romfs filesystem

* [CVE-2024-25394](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues/8291) – Multiple vulnerabilities in RT-Thread ymodem utility
* Use of [outdated](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=ee1523630a81fffa6b7d93dd0c7a6191de5856cd) [lwIP](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=b413b040936f48d4cd9ed632ac579542c710efae) and [TinyDir](https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2023-04-tinydir.txt) dependencies in RT-Thread

For additional information about these **vulnerabilities** and their **fixes**, please refer to the detailed [advisory](https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2024-05-rt-thread.txt).

Since a few months, I’ve started to consistently keep track of my research efforts using the excellent [Be Focused](https://xwavesoft.com/be-focused-pro-for-iphone-ipad-mac-os-x.html) pomodoro timer app. Therefore, I know that it took me about **32 hours** to complete this project (not including the time spent for the disclosure process).

### Disclosure and fixes

I reported the vulnerabilities discussed in this article to RT-Thread in November 2023, by opening [issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=author%3A0xdea+rt-thread&s=created&type=issues) on GitHub [as directed](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/issues/8250) by the maintainers. Following my [request](https://www.cve.org/ReportRequest/ReportRequestForNonCNAs), MITRE assigned **CVE IDs** to all vulnerabilities in February 2024.

RT-Thread developers have fixed some of the vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities are still open. Even though not all vulnerabilities were fixed, I decided to go ahead with public disclosure after about 90 days since the initial reports. This decision was taken mainly based on the fact that the **vulnerability reports were already publicly accessible** as GitHub issues.

The detailed coordinated disclosure **timeline** follows:

* 2023-11-12: Asked on GitHub how to report potential security issues.
* 2023-11-13: RT-Thread founder replied to open issues directly on GitHub.
* 2023-11-20: Opened the first issue on GitHub.
* 2023-11-24: First vulnerability fixed; reported some other vulnerabilities.
* 2023-11-28: Second (and third) vulnerability fixed.
* 2023-12-24: Asked maintainers for updates.
* 2024-01-17: Requested the first batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
* 2024-01-26: Informed maintainers of plan to publish advisory in February.
* 2024-02-02: Requested the second batch of CVE IDs from MITRE.
* 2024-02-07: CVE IDs for all reported vulnerabilities assigned by MITRE.
* 2024-02-08: Communicated CVE IDs and new 2024-03-05 publication date.
* 2024-02-18: Maintainers acknowledge publication date and inform about new fixes.
* 2024-03-05: Published advisory and writeup.

Please check the official RT-Thread channels for further information about fixes.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank RT-Thread, lwIP, and TinyDir developers for the time dedicated to triaging the reported vulnerabilities. I would also like to thank MITRE for assigning CVE IDs upon my request.
