WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product
• Restrict access to the web interface of the affected products, if deactivation is not supported by the

product

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1242-7 and CP 1243-7 LTE communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 con-
trollers to Wide Area Networks (WAN). They provide integrated security functions such as firewall, Virtual
Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 controllers via the
SINAUT ST7 telecontrol protocol to a control center or master ST7 stations.

SIMATIC CP 1243-1 communications processors connect S7-1200 controllers to Ethernet networks. They
provide integrated security functions such as firewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other
protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 1543-1, CP 1543SP-1, CP 1542SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC communications processors
connect SIMATIC S7-1500 controllers to Ethernet networks. They provide integrated security functions
such as firewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

SIMATIC IPC DiagBase diagnostics software allows to recognize early on any potential faults on SIMATIC
IPCs and helps to avoid or reduce system downtimes.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIMATIC IPC DiagMonitor monitors, reports, visualizes and logs the system states of the SIMATIC IPCs.
It communicates with other systems and reacts when events occur.

TIM 1531 IRC is a communication module for SIMATIC S7-1500, S7-400, S7-300 with SINAUT ST7,
DNP3 and IEC 60870-5-101/104 with three RJ45 interfaces for communication via IP-based networks
(WAN / LAN) and a RS 232/RS 485 interface for communication via classic WAN networks.
