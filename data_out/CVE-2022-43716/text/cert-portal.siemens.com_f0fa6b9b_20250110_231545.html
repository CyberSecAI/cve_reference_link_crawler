SSA-139628: Vulnerabilities in Web Server for Scalance X Products

| Publication Date: | 2021-01-12 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2021-09-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 9.8 |

SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X switches contain vulnerabilities in the web server of the affected devices.

An unauthenticated attacker could reboot, cause denial-of-service conditions and potentially impact the system by other means through heap and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V5.2.5 | Update to V5.2.5 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109801131/> |
| SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V5.5.0 | Update to V5.5.0 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109792534/> |
| SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V4.1.0   only affected by CVE-2020-15800 | Update to V4.1.0 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773547/> |

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Limit network traffic of web servers of Scalance X switches to trusted connections by firewall rules (port 443/tcp).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15799

The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to reboot the device over the network by using special urls from integrated web server of the affected products.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function |

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15800

The webserver of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a heap overflow condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending specially crafted requests. This could stop the webserver temporarily.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:X/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow |

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25226

The web server of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a buffer overflow condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending a specially crafted request. The webserver could stop and not recover anymore.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |
