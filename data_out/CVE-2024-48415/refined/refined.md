Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the "New Borrower" functionality of the Loan Management System v1.0. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the user-supplied input for fields such as lastname, firstname, middlename, address, contact_no, email, and tax_id before displaying or storing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability present is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can lead to various impacts, including:
   - Stealing user session cookies
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user
   - Defacing the website
   - Potentially gaining access to sensitive user data
  
**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the "New Borrower" functionality on the "Borrowers" page. Specifically, the attack consists of:
   1. Accessing the Loan Management System application.
   2. Logging in to the application.
   3. Navigating to the "Borrower" section and accessing the "New Borrower" functionality.
   4. Inputting the XSS payload into fields such as the lastname, firstname, middlename, address, contact_no, email, and tax_id parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to have access to the application.
   - The attacker needs to be logged in to the system
   - The attacker needs to access the "New Borrower" functionality.
   - The attacker needs to be able to input malicious scripts into the specified fields.
