The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nestie()` function in the `nestie` npm module does not validate the input object's properties before assigning values, allowing an attacker to manipulate the object prototype by injecting `__proto__` properties.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution vulnerability: The lack of validation in the `nestie()` function allows modification of the Object prototype.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting the prototype, an attacker can potentially disrupt the application's functionality, leading to a denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Prototype pollution can also be a vector for RCE if the polluted properties are later accessed and used in a way that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Malicious input: An attacker can inject malicious values into the `input` argument of the `nestie()` function by including the `__proto__` property within it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges required: An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction required: The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
