Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8172

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the SourceCodester QR Code Attendance System 1.0. It stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input. Specifically, the `student` parameter in the `delete-student.php` file is vulnerable.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the `student` parameter of the `delete-student.php` endpoint.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, typically by intercepting traffic using tools like Burp Suite. The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to craft a malicious payload and how to send it to the server. It also requires that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can lead to a range of malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites. The impact is on integrity of the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Parameter:** `student` parameter in `delete-student.php`
*   **Vulnerable URL:** `/endpoint/delete-student.php`
*   **Payload Example:** The provided payload is `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e`, which, when decoded, becomes `<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`. This payload injects an `<img>` tag and a `<script>` tag with an alert, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Exploitation:** The attacker intercepts the request to `delete-student.php`, modifies the `student` parameter with the malicious payload, and sends the modified request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SourceCodester QR Code Attendance System 1.0
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   The exploit is publicly available and is considered easy to execute.
*   There are no known countermeasures at the time of the report.
