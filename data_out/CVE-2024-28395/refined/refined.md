- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `bestkit_popup::prepareHook()` method in the "Pop-up / Schedule Popup / Splash window" module for PrestaShop contains SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-controlled input. Specifically, the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` is not properly escaped before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock adminâ€™s ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors:** Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can perform the SQL injection with a trivial HTTP call, without requiring any privileges or user interaction. The attack can be concealed in conventional frontend logs as it appears as "POST /".
