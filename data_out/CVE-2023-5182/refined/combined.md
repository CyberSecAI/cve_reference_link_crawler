install: create autoinstall-user-data 0400

```
[CVE-2023-5182](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9j7r-mqx9-67mv "CVE-2023-5182")

As autoinstall-user-data contains a password hash hash for a user with
sudo access, create the autoinstall-user-data as 0400 root:root.

The old permissions are 0640 root:adm, and the adm group does not by
default have sudo access, so cracking that hash could lead to privilege
escallation for someone in the adm group.

Thanks to Patric Åhlin and Johan Hortling for identifying and reporting
the issue.
