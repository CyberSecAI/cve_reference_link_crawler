Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability found in the `manage_complaint.php` file of the Complaints Report Management System version 1.0. The vulnerability occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter passed via the GET request, before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-controlled data into a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially escalate privileges within the application's database.
- Data Access and Manipulation: Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database, modify existing data, or potentially delete data.
- Server Compromise: In severe cases, successful exploitation of a SQL injection vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/admin/manage_complaint.php`.
- Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection principles is required to craft malicious payloads.
- Access to the admin panel is required as the vulnerable script resides in `/admin/` directory

**Additional Details:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command and request data can be used to test and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Complaints Report Management System.
