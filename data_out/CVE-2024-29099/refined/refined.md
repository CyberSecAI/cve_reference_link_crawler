- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Evergreen Content Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through a vector that is not detailed but is likely user-supplied input. The attack can be done without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to perform this attack.
