Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The web pages shipped as part of IBM CICS TX Standard are vulnerable to both Cross-site Scripting (Reflected) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (Reflected):** This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** This allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of XSS could lead to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing websites
*   Successful exploitation of CSRF could allow attackers to:
    *   Perform unauthorized actions (e.g., change settings, make purchases) on the user's behalf without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS (Reflected):** An attacker crafts a malicious link or injects malicious input into a vulnerable parameter that is then reflected back to the user's browser.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page or email containing a request that will be executed by a victim's browser when they visit the attacker's page, assuming they are logged into the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS (Reflected):**  The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a crafted link or interacting with a malicious input. The attacker may also need some knowledge of the vulnerable application's input parameters.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs the victim to be authenticated in the vulnerable web application during the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM CICS TX Standard version 11.1.
*   IBM provides a fix (ifix26 or ifix24) that should be applied to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
*   There are no listed workarounds.
