| Bug Report  * **Shescape version**: `v1.5.0` * **Operating system**: Unix (Ubuntu 20.04) * **Shell**: Bash  Description If the string `=~` appears at the end of an argument in Bash (without quoting the argument) the tilde (`~`) will be expanded to the home directory. Similarly, when `xxx:~`, `~:xxx` or `xxx:~:xxx` appears after `=` (where `xxx` can be *any* string), the tilde (`~`) will be expanded, this even works for multiple tildes. Actual Behaviour When running `shescape.escape(All)` with interpolation escaping enabled the trailing `~` is not escaped and therefore expanded when the argument is used. Expected Behaviour When running `shescape.escape(All)` with interpolation escaping enabled the trailing `~` should be escaped to avoid it being expanded when the argument is used. Working Examples This category of bug was found by fuzzing, the crash results can be found here:   * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-d064460acb19928e9d39d88104d3babbac73b8c3.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8102801/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-d064460acb19928e9d39d88104d3babbac73b8c3.zip.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-3f7da262eedcbbafb9fa6c88a73f27ccad35541e.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8102799/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-3f7da262eedcbbafb9fa6c88a73f27ccad35541e.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-d9afe26e335c8ec19274bf4a631cdce570169161.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8102971/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-d9afe26e335c8ec19274bf4a631cdce570169161.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-71ebbf663da3b83efd509e136ab3424293fa42bd.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8103194/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-71ebbf663da3b83efd509e136ab3424293fa42bd.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-bff706bd1435d57c3d433d63d50f7e2f7e87f4f4.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8104027/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-bff706bd1435d57c3d433d63d50f7e2f7e87f4f4.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-50ab31df9b55f3b4953d5db689c25cdef1014e40.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8104056/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-50ab31df9b55f3b4953d5db689c25cdef1014e40.zip) * [fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-18410404c15407d04365ed5149d537e6d222b172.zip](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/files/8104285/fuzz-crash-ubuntu-latest-18410404c15407d04365ed5149d537e6d222b172.zip) |
