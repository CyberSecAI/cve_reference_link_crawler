{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `shescape` library, when used with the `interpolation` option set to `true` on Unix systems with Bash, fails to properly escape tilde characters (`~`) that appear at the end of a string or after an equals sign (`=`), leading to unintended home directory expansion by the shell.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of the user's home directory, potentially leading to directory traversal vulnerabilities within the application using `shescape`.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing specially crafted strings containing tilde characters in specific contexts (e.g., `payload = \"home_directory=~\"`) to the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions of the shescape API with the interpolation option enabled.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to `shescape.escape` or `shescape.escapeAll` when the `interpolation` option is set to `true`. This input needs to be passed to Bash"
  },
  "affected_versions": ">=1.4.0 <1.5.1",
  "patched_versions": "1.5.1",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specific to Bash and does not affect other tested shells like Dash and Zsh. The issue was discovered through fuzzing. The fix involves correctly escaping the tilde character (`~`) in various contexts where it would be expanded by Bash."
