  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the mountfs script where it mounts a file system to the root directory. This action was performed before the temporary file systems were set up for /root, /var, and /tmp directories, resulting in a failure to establish the temporary file systems. This vulnerability can be exploited through manipulation of the /root, /tmp, and /var directories, allowing for code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness lies in the improper handling of mount points within the mountfs script combined with the lack of complete integrity validation during the Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA) process.\n\n- The mountfs script remounts the root filesystem as read-write to '/', without checking if it is already mounted.\n-  The PBA process does not validate symlinks or file attributes, only file contents.\n- The system is vulnerable to symlink manipulation in the absence of checks against pre-existing mounts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:\n\n- Gain code execution by modifying system files (e.g., /root/.profile).\n- Bypass the PBA file integrity checks and take control of the system's boot process.\n- Steal the Disk Encryption Key (DEK) and decrypt the Windows partition.\n- Implant malicious code to further compromise the ATM.\n- Modify standard ATM functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires physical access to the ATM's file system (P5 partition) and the ability to modify files on that partition. This is achieved by:\n\n- Manipulating symlinks for /root, /tmp, and /var to point to the root directory. This results in the mount command failing, and thus the /root /tmp /var directories being mapped to disk instead of a ramdisk.\n- Modifying the /root/.profile file to execute malicious code.\n-  Taking advantage of the incomplete PBA validation process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have:\n\n- Physical access to the ATM.\n- Ability to access and modify the unencrypted Linux partition (P5).\n- Knowledge of the boot sequence and the location of relevant files.\n- Ability to create symlinks and manipulate the system configuration."
