- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Active debug code present in the Mitsubishi Electric MELFA SD/SQ series and F-series robot controllers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to the active debug code, allowing unauthorized telnet login.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the robot controller, potentially leading to manipulation or disruption of the robot's operation.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity, allowing an attacker to perform an unauthorized telnet login over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the robot controller to exploit this vulnerability. No special privileges or user interaction are required.
