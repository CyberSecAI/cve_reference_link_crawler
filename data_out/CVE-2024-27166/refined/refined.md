        "Passwords are stored in clear-text logs"

  },
  "additional_details": {
   "plaintext_storage": "The vulnerability exists in Toshiba MFPs where user login and password modification actions result in the passwords being stored in cleartext in world readable log files. Specific logs mentioned include /ramdisk/work/log/al/boserverEvent.log.*.txt and /ramdisk/al/network/log/http.log. Additionally, the insecure permissions of these files make them vulnerable to modification, and a remote attacker can potentially retrieve credentials and bypass the authentication via a crafted .htaccess file. ",
    "hardcoded_password": "All Toshiba printers use the same hardcoded root password, present in the /etc/shadow file, which has not been updated since at least 2017. Furthermore, a hardcoded key ('1048toshibatec') is used to encrypt log files, and MD5, a weak digest cipher is used to derivate the secret key from the hardcoded value. The same hardcoded key ('1048toshibatec') is present in `/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/release/bin/alreportmanager` and `/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/release/bin/alusermgr`"
