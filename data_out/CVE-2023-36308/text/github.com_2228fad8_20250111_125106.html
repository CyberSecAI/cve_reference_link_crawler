### **[pic4xiu](/pic4xiu)** commented [Jul 14, 2023](#issue-1804214116)

| When we use the imaging library to parse a maliciously constructed graph, the `scan` function of the `scanner.go` file will have an index out of bounds problem. The verification procedure is as follows:  ``` package main  import ( 	"image" 	"os" 	"runtime"  	"github.com/disintegration/imaging" )  func main() { 	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1) 	file, _ := os.Open("poc.tiff") 	src, _, err := image.Decode(file) 	if err != nil { 		return 	} 	imaging.Grayscale(src) }  ```  the `poc.tiff` is here:<https://github.com/pic4xiu/pocRep/blob/main/poc.tiff> what happened ``` ‚ùØ go run poc.go panic: runtime error: index out of range [70] with length 65  goroutine 3 [running]: github.com/disintegration/imaging.(*scanner).scan(0x1400002a040, 0x0, 0x0, 0x96, 0x1, {0x140000f0000, 0x0?, 0xf168})         /Users/**/go/pkg/mod/github.com/disintegration/imaging@v1.6.2/scanner.go:242 +0x3a4 github.com/disintegration/imaging.Grayscale.func1(0x0?)         /Users/**/go/pkg/mod/github.com/disintegration/imaging@v1.6.2/adjust.go:16 +0xa0 github.com/disintegration/imaging.parallel.func1()         /Users/**/go/pkg/mod/github.com/disintegration/imaging@v1.6.2/utils.go:33 +0x5c created by github.com/disintegration/imaging.parallel         /Users/**/go/pkg/mod/github.com/disintegration/imaging@v1.6.2/utils.go:31 +0xcc exit status 2  ``` specific reason The specific statement that causes the program panic is in line 242 of scanner.go: `c := s.palette[img.Pix[i]]`. When processing this picture, `len(img.Palette)` is only 65, but `img.Pix[i]` is indexed to 70 from the beginning, causing an out-of-bounds:  ``` package main  import ( 	"fmt" 	"image" 	"os" 	"runtime"  	"github.com/disintegration/imaging" )  func main() { 	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1) 	file, _ := os.Open("poc.tiff") 	src, _, err := image.Decode(file) 	if err != nil { 		return 	} 	if img, ok := src.(*image.Paletted); ok { 		fmt.Println(len(img.Palette)) 	} 	imaging.Grayscale(src) }  > go run .\main.go 65 panic: runtime error: index out of range [70] with length 65  ```  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/40382944/253481354-98c84cac-ca80-4fdc-8119-629b40774a8b.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.l2xN-y6VP9qguw1GMEIlIiAjRznmCY05Q_XW3JDpBw8) |

`[tiff: Validate palette indices when parsing palette-color images](/golang/image/commit/3bbf4a659e56fde394e7214ddd17673223aca672 "tiff: Validate palette indices when parsing palette-color images

The existing implementation will succeed to parse a corrupt or malicious
image with color indices out of range of the actual palette, which will
eventually result in a panic when the consumer tries to read the color
at any corrupted pixel.

This issue was originally discovered and filed against a downstream
library: https://github.com/disintegration/imaging/issues/165. This is
also referenced in https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-q7pp-wcgr-pffx.

Fixes golang/go#67624
