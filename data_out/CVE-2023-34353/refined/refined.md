- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable key derivation method for encrypting user credentials. The AES encryption key is derived from a seed value (present in the `U_EP` protobuf) with a simple subtraction and concatenation with a static base key which is easily reversible.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Weak Key Derivation:**  The key generation is not cryptographically secure, allowing an attacker to easily recreate the key.
    - **Use of Static Base Key:** The use of the static base key `eh84hsa8jkla2othiqugua4q398rsuq4` makes the encryption predictable.
    - **Insufficient Randomness:** The seed value is not sufficiently random.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can decrypt the encrypted username and password by sniffing network traffic containing `U_EP` structures. This would allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the OAS Engine.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network sniffing: An attacker needs to eavesdrop on network traffic to intercept the `U_EP` protobuf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to capture network traffic containing the vulnerable protocol communications. No prior knowledge of the encryption key is required, as it can be derived from the intercepted data.
