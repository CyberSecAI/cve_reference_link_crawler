# Non-MFA account takeover via brute-force attack on weak password reset code

High

[ibuler](/ibuler)
published
GHSA-mwx4-8fwc-2xvw
Sep 26, 2023

## Package

pip

jumpserver
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

v2.0.0-v2.28.19,v3.0.0-v3.7.0

## Patched versions

v2.28.20,v3.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The verification code for resetting user's password is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to the absence of rate limiting.

### Details

JumpServer provides a feature allowing users to reset forgotten passwords. Affected users are sent a 6-digit verification code, ranging from 000000 to 999999, to facilitate the password reset. Although the code is only available in 1 minute, this window potentially allows for up to 1,000,000 validation attempts.

### Patches

Safe versions:

* v2.28.20
* v3.7.1

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade the safe versions.

After the upgrade, entering the verification code can only be attempted 3 times, then the code will be expired.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
