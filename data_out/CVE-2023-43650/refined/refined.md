- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password reset functionality in JumpServer uses a 6-digit verification code which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to the absence of rate limiting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing rate limiting on password reset verification code attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can brute-force the 6-digit verification code and successfully reset a user's password, leading to account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by sending multiple password reset attempts to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the JumpServer instance and know a valid username in the system.
