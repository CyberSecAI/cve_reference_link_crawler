Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-33891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `HttpSecurityFilter` within the Apache Spark UI. When ACLs are enabled (`spark.acls.enable`), the filter attempts to verify user access permissions. However, it improperly handles user names, allowing a malicious user to provide an arbitrary user name and impersonate another user. This impersonation leads to a subsequent permission check function that constructs and executes a Unix shell command based on the attacker-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `HttpSecurityFilter` does not properly sanitize or validate user names, allowing for the injection of arbitrary user names.
*   **Impersonation:** The ability to provide an arbitrary user name allows for unauthorized impersonation of other users within the Spark environment.
*   **Shell Command Injection:**  The permission check function, after impersonation, constructs a shell command with unsanitized input, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in arbitrary shell command execution with the privileges of the user that Spark is running as. This can allow the attacker to potentially compromise the entire system running Apache Spark.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Apache Spark UI that includes an arbitrary user name to trigger the vulnerable code path within HttpSecurityFilter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Apache Spark UI.
*   ACLs (`spark.acls.enable`) must be enabled.
*   The attacker must be able to bypass any existing authentication measures.

**Additional Notes:**
