The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A bug in the amdgpu driver's vram manager caused a kernel panic when unloading the amdgpu module. Specifically, the `drm_buddy_free_list` function was called with the incorrect member of the `rsv` structure (`blocks` instead of `allocated`), which led to a use-after-free or double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect pointer passed to `drm_buddy_free_list` during amdgpu module unload.
- Memory corruption due to use-after-free or double-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash / panic
- System instability

**Attack vectors:**
- Unloading the amdgpu kernel module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to unload kernel modules, typically requiring root privileges.
