## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Giveaways and Contests by RafflePress < 1.12.16 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Giveaways settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editor and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "RafflePress > Giveaways"
2. Edit one of the default Giveaways.
3. Under design, change the "Button color" field to `</style><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
4. Save settings and see the XSS on the frontend of the site or via previewing
