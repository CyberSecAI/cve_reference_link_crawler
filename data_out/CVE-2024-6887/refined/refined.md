- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its giveaway settings. Specifically, the "Button color" field under design settings is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with editor or higher privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the giveaway settings. This code will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected giveaways, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with editor or higher privileges can access the plugin's settings and inject malicious code in the "Button color" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least editor privileges within the WordPress site.
