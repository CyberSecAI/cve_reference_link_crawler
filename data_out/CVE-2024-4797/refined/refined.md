Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application echoes user-supplied input directly into the HTML response without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the parameters `name`, `customer_name`, and `username` in the `/ajax.php` script are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This occurs because user-controlled input is directly inserted into the HTML document, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the web page.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user (if authenticated).
  - Phishing attacks, by displaying fake login forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests to `/ajax.php`:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious POST requests to the vulnerable `/ajax.php` endpoint.  The `action` parameter in the POST request dictates which function is called.
- The parameters `name`, `customer_name`, and `username` in the POST body are used to inject the malicious javascript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application's server. This could be achieved via a malicious link, a compromised website or an XSS attack on another part of the application.
- The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication in some cases (e.g. the user parameter in the 'save_user' action requires authentication, other actions don't) to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters/Actions:**

- **`action=save_category`**: The `name` parameter is vulnerable.
- **`action=save_laundry`**: The `customer_name` parameter is vulnerable.
- **`action=save_supply`**: The `name` parameter is vulnerable.
- **`action=save_user`**: Both `name` and `username` parameters are vulnerable.

**Payload Example:**
- The provided payload `<svg/onload=alert``>` is a simple example that triggers a JavaScript alert box. An attacker could use much more sophisticated payloads to achieve a more malicious effect.

**Additional Notes**
