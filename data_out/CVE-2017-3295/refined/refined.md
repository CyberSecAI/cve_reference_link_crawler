Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3295:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the `vspdf.dll` library processes the `/Matrix` entry within a `/CalRGB` entry in a PDF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code processing the `/Matrix` entry assumes that it contains exactly nine elements. When a PDF file with less than nine elements for this entry is processed, a read access violation occurs.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The insufficient input validation leads to a crash, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is a **denial of service** due to a read access violation. The affected application processing the malformed PDF file will crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file that includes a `/CalRGB` entry with a `/Matrix` entry containing fewer than nine elements. This malicious PDF can be delivered via various means, such as:
 - Email attachment
 - Malicious file served via HTTP

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PDF file with the specific malformed `/CalRGB` and `/Matrix` content.
- They do not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious PDF to a system that uses the vulnerable `vspdf.dll` library. For example, in the case of Microsoft Exchange, the attacker would send the PDF via email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in `vspdf.dll` version 8.5.2.70 (used in Microsoft Exchange Server) and 8.5.3.0 (used in Oracle Outside In).
- Oracle released a patch for this vulnerability in the January 17, 2017 CPU.
- The Tenable advisory indicates a CVSSv2 score of 7.1 / 5.6 (Base/Temporal) with the vector (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)
