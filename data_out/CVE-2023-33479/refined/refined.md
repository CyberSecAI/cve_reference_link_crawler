Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `/staff/edit.php` file of the RemoteClinic application. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct embedding of the user-supplied `id` parameter into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, which the database server will execute.
    *   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses `mysqli_query` to execute the query directly, instead of using prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user-provided data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this SQL injection vulnerability to:
    *   **Database Information Disclosure:** Retrieve sensitive data from the database, including usernames, password hashes, and other application data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data stored within the database.
    *   **Potential Full System Compromise:** If the database user has higher privileges, it may be possible to compromise the underlying server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/staff/edit.php` endpoint, with a malicious payload embedded within the `id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server hosting the vulnerable `/staff/edit.php` page.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter in `/staff/edit.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Session ID:** The provided exploit requires a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie to be included in the request.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by user `n0kovo`.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `staff/edit.php` at line 62: `$profile=mysqli_fetch_object(mysqli_query($con, "select * from p_staff_dir where id='$id'"))`
*   The provided PoC uses SQL injection to extract database names and user credentials.
*   The proof of concept uses a delimiter to separate the injected data.
*   The issue is assigned CVE-2023-33479.
