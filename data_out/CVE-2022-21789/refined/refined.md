- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using a shared resource without proper synchronization in audio ipi.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the race condition in audio ipi.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not required.
