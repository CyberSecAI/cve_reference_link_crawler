### **[czbxzm](/czbxzm)** commented [Oct 31, 2023](#issue-1969464544)

| Describe the bug This bug will allow drones to breach the no-fly zone in 2 ways. To Reproduce Attack Steps:  the first way: The operator intentionally controls the UAV to touch the edge of the electronic geo-fence to trigger a response to enter RTL mode When the drone enters RTL mode, it will fly to a preset return point. By setting the return point in a no-fly zone such as an airport, the aircraft will fly in the no-fly zone.  the second way:  When a drone is in the air, paint the drone into a no-fly zone and the aircraft can still perform its mission in no-fly zone.  **Further exploitation of the second bugÔºö** While the second option may seem less threatening, as it is the user breaking out of the no-fly zone they have drawn for themselves, further exploitation exists based on this vulnerability. When the operator is malicious:  PX4 supports importing no-fly zone files, and some diy aircraft manufacturers using this open source flight control choose to import airport no-fly zone information for their aircraft ahead of time. A malicious user could draw a new no-fly zone right next to the edge of an existing no-fly zone and close it. The new no-fly zone is turned on while the drone is flying in the new no-fly zone. There would be no additional status check at the junction of the two no-fly zones, which would allow a malicious operator to enter the existing airport no-fly zone.  <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42442851/276902943-3b491015-50e4-478c-8fd7-1be0aefef23a.png> Expected behavior After setting a no-fly zone, drones should not enter it, which is a violation of user policy. RTL as part of the flight should also check if it enters the no-fly zone.

| [#22394](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22394) takes care of parts of the issues raised here: It is now no longer possible to update a GF in air if it would get immediately breached, and secondly, it is not possible to plan a geofence without including Home in it. There are though currently no checks for the Rally (safe landing) points. Could be added fairly easy I assume. |

### @sfuhrer **[sfuhrer](/sfuhrer)** commented [Nov 16, 2023](#issue-1997110853) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

### Solved Problem

Fixes:

1. listen to GF\_SOURCE (fixes [Geofence\_breach\_check doesn't rely on GF\_SOURCE anymore. Always uses global\_pos.\*¬†#20677](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20677))
2. do not constantly send new reposition waypoints when GF is breached as a fixed-wing

New features:

3) if armed, do not allow to upload GF that would immediately trigger

4) do not allow to upload GF if it doesn't contain Home (to not break RTL)

Functional changes (neither new features nor fixes):

5) has to be in all inclusion GF

6) remove GF\_ALTMODE (with the big baro offset usually present this is quite unusable)

7) remove GF\_COUNT (don't see need, don't find it intuitive)

8) change messaging

9) some code cleanup

### Solution

1. correctly listen to it.
2. if GF\_ACTION is HOLD, and GF is breached: stay in the "GF breached mode" until the current loiter is changed (through new reposition or change of mode) --> see [66ca5c2](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/66ca5c294952689e0775c5136ad0d7f6604a2d17)
3. check GF breach in update function, and stop updating the current GF if it would immediately get breached --> see [83f3665](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/83f3665d9576b453142196c2e4725e46728d1f46)
4. check GF breach in update function, and stop updating the current GF if it doesn't contain Home --> see [83f3665](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/83f3665d9576b453142196c2e4725e46728d1f46)
5. Change logic that all GF action already gets triggered when the GF leaves one inclusion GF, not only when outside of all inclusion GF.

   I'm not entirely sure what we want, but for me it seems cleaner that way.
6. remove it.
7. remote it.
8. see [8e1c3e8](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/8e1c3e8093e3da0dbe9a276eb01d2672d7cd190b):

* geofence\_result.cpp contains to contain separate fields for the 3 geofence types
* remote "primary" from messages, as we don't distinguish primary vs secondary etc
* do all user notification due to GF breach from Commander

9. various

### Changelog Entry

For release notes:

```
Bugfix: Geofence: correctly listen to GF_SOURCE
Bugfix: Geofence: do not constantly send new reposition waypoints when GF is breached as a fixed-wing
Feature: Geofence: if armed, do not allow to upload GF that would immediately trigger
Feature: Geofence: do not allow to upload GF if it doesn't contain Home (to not break RTL)
Documentation: TODO

```
### Alternatives

We should also fix the pre-emptive geofence triggering (GF\_PREDICT=1). I haven't touched that in this PR, and even split it up further (without GF\_PREDICT=1 it will now always set the Hold point at the position it is currently at).

### Test coverage

SITL tested

### Context

Screen recording with current main, where issues 4) and 2) are visible:

Screen recording of this PR, where the new features 3) and 4) are shown, plus fixed 2):

Hello [@sfuhrer](https://github.com/sfuhrer) ! It appears there might be a potential issue with the invocation of the checkMissionAgainstGeofence() function when only the geofence undergoes an update [484a44e](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/484a44e5e97c24ef74d108d26725d38f73db5e39) . The problem is related to the state machine and asynchronous message reading in geofence.cpp.I'm here to assist further if needed.

Do you mean that when you update the geofence, you would want the mission feasibility checks to be run immediately against it, and then   * (A) reject the geofence update if the mission feasibility check then would fail * (B) make the mission invalid   ? |

| Hi! Do you mean that when you update the geofence, you would want the mission feasibility checks to be run immediately against it, and then   * reject the geofence update if the mission feasibility check then would fail * make the mission invalid  Yes.  Currently, the same upload button doesn't trigger a check when updating only the fence, only updating the mission triggers a check, which I think is patently unreasonable.  For example, a scenario like this: a user plans a task in advance and passes the check, is ready to execute it some time later, but doesn't get a notification that the task is not compliant until just before execution. |

| It wasn't a yes/no question üòÖ Which of the two options would you prefer? A or B? Before we decide on that we cannot implement anything.  when I update the geofence, I need the mission feasibility checks to be run immediately. Since the geofence and mission updates are under the same button "upload", we just need to reject this update(include geofence and mission if they have been updated) and leave it as it was before we clicked upload.So,it is a yes/no question.üòÄ  Since now there is already a feasibility check in the module of the mission, when a new upload of a new mission is not available, it will be rejected. We can accomplish the above by simply adding the same check to the geofence.Like this:[#22531](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22531) |

| It wasn't a yes/no question üòÖ Which of the two options would you prefer? A or B? Before we decide on that we cannot implement anything.  when I update the geofence, I need the mission feasibility checks to be run immediately. Since the geofence and mission updates are under the same button "upload", we just need to reject this update(include geofence and mission if they have been updated) and leave it as it was before we clicked upload.So,it is a yes/no question.üòÄ  Since now there is already a feasibility check in the module of the mission, when a new upload of a new mission is not available, it will be rejected. We can accomplish the above by simply adding the same check to the geofence.Like this:[#22531](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22531)  But isn't that exactly option A? You propose to reject the GF if it's not compatible with the mission. |
