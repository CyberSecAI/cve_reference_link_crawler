### **[czbxzm](/czbxzm)** commented [Oct 31, 2023](#issue-1969464544)

| Describe the bug This bug will allow drones to breach the no-fly zone in 2 ways. To Reproduce Attack Steps:  the first way: The operator intentionally controls the UAV to touch the edge of the electronic geo-fence to trigger a response to enter RTL mode When the drone enters RTL mode, it will fly to a preset return point. By setting the return point in a no-fly zone such as an airport, the aircraft will fly in the no-fly zone.  the second way:  When a drone is in the air, paint the drone into a no-fly zone and the aircraft can still perform its mission in no-fly zone.  **Further exploitation of the second bugÔºö** While the second option may seem less threatening, as it is the user breaking out of the no-fly zone they have drawn for themselves, further exploitation exists based on this vulnerability. When the operator is malicious:  PX4 supports importing no-fly zone files, and some diy aircraft manufacturers using this open source flight control choose to import airport no-fly zone information for their aircraft ahead of time. A malicious user could draw a new no-fly zone right next to the edge of an existing no-fly zone and close it. The new no-fly zone is turned on while the drone is flying in the new no-fly zone. There would be no additional status check at the junction of the two no-fly zones, which would allow a malicious operator to enter the existing airport no-fly zone.  <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42442851/276902943-3b491015-50e4-478c-8fd7-1be0aefef23a.png> Expected behavior After setting a no-fly zone, drones should not enter it, which is a violation of user policy. RTL as part of the flight should also check if it enters the no-fly zone.

| [#22394](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22394) takes care of parts of the issues raised here: It is now no longer possible to update a GF in air if it would get immediately breached, and secondly, it is not possible to plan a geofence without including Home in it. There are though currently no checks for the Rally (safe landing) points. Could be added fairly easy I assume. |
