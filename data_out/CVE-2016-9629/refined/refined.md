Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `shiftAnchorPosition()` function of the w3m browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access a member (`marks[a->hseq].line`) of a structure pointed to by `hl`, which is determined to be `NULL` at the time of access, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) which will likely cause the w3m browser to crash. This can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTML input that triggers the vulnerable code path in `shiftAnchorPosition()`. This input, provided in the comments of the github issue, includes specific HTML tags and attributes which lead to the `hl` pointer becoming NULL, which is then dereferenced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable w3m instance to process the malicious HTML. This could be achieved by hosting the page on a website that the user accesses with w3m, or by having the user open a locally saved HTML file crafted by the attacker. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by `afl-fuzz`, a fuzzer.
- The issue was quickly fixed by the maintainer with a commit which prevents the null dereference.
- The fix was backported to Debian.
