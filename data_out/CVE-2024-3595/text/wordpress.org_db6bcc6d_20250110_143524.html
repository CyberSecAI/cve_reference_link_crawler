Adds a lot of overhead, which can not be optimized – slows your site down. Good luck trying to speed optimize your site if you use this. Nice render blocking scripts dynamically loaded.

Doesn’t work on my website even if I followed the installation procedure step by step. Technical support is poor.

### [It works, but slow site performance / load times](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-works-but-slow-site-performance-load-times/)

It works grate, but it does add a bit of extra time to to load your website when enabled. It uses Javascript, so that is heavy weight.
I do like the dashboard and mobile app, no issues with those.
