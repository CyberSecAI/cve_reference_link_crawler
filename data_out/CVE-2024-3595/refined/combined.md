Adds a lot of overhead, which can not be optimized – slows your site down. Good luck trying to speed optimize your site if you use this. Nice render blocking scripts dynamically loaded.

Doesn’t work on my website even if I followed the installation procedure step by step. Technical support is poor.

It works grate, but it does add a bit of extra time to to load your website when enabled. It uses Javascript, so that is heavy weight.
I do like the dashboard and mobile app, no issues with those.

### Description

The Pure Chat – Live Chat Plugin & More! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the purechatwid and purechatwname parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
