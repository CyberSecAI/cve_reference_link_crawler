Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-48507:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*  **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Low privileges (PR:L) - The attacker needs some form of authenticated access to the application to inject the malicious payload.
    *   User interaction (UI:R) - The attacker relies on a victim user to interact with the injected payload.
*   **Vulnerable Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** AEM Cloud Service (CS) and 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions.
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied data leading to the injection of malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser, allowing attackers to potentially steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or further compromise the application and underlying infrastructure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user inputs, allowing for the persistence of malicious scripts that can be executed later by other users.
