The content is related to CVE-2024-23737.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the user upload functionality of the S/Notify application for Jira.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: An attacker can force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions, such as uploading, replacing, or removing an S/MIME certificate or PGP key through a malicious link or website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could upload a specifically crafted S/MIME certificate or PGP key for the user. This would lead to emails being encrypted with the attacker's key, preventing the user from decrypting and reading their notifications. The impact is considered low due to the likelihood of detection since users would stop receiving readable email.

**Attack vectors:**
- Social engineering: The attack is initiated by tricking the user into clicking a malicious link in an email or visiting a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- The attacker must be able to craft an S/MIME certificate or PGP key that matches the user's email address to replace the existing key.
