## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Floating Contact Button < 2.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to the “Floating Contact” section of WP Admin
2. Locate the “Insert here your shortcode” field.
3. Enter the following payload: ` "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`
4. Check the button next to "jQuery"
5. Click on "Save Settings" to apply the changes.
6. Confirm that the XSS is triggered by observing an alert on the homepage screen.
