{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow in the handling of the PPPOEPassword parameter within the formQuickIndex function of the Tenda AC500 router firmware.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through the PPPOEPassword parameter of the formQuickIndex function.",
       "This is likely exploitable via HTTP requests to the web management interface of the router."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This may require network access to the router, and potentially authentication."
