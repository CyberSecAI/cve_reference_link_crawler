The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.9 via the 'pm_upload_image' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change the profile picture of any user.
