- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient protections for a sensitive access token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to the ability to access resources within the device infrastructure using a sensitive access token.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain *root* access to the filesystem or hosted containers on an affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device, specifically leveraging an access token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have valid `rescue-user` credentials.
