Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2491:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content, specifically from wordfence.com, explicitly mentions "PowerPack Addons for Elementor <= 2.7.17 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via *\_html\_tag\*", and associates this with CVE-2024-2491, confirming the content's relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `*_html_tag*` attributes of multiple widgets within the PowerPack Addons for Elementor plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
   - Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages.
   - These scripts execute whenever a user accesses an infected page.
   - This can lead to malicious actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other unauthorized activities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - Authenticated users with Contributor level access or higher can inject malicious scripts.
   - This is a stored XSS, so the malicious script is saved within the WordPress database.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
   - The attacker needs the ability to modify content using Elementor and PowerPack Addons.

**Additional details:**
- The Wordfence content indicates that the vulnerability was publicly published on March 29, 2024.
- The vulnerable plugin versions are PowerPack Addons for Elementor <= 2.7.17.
- The patched version is 2.7.18.
- The specific location of the vulnerable code is in the handling of `*_html_tag*` attributes in several different widgets. 
- The provided code snippets show the fix implemented by using `elementor.helpers.validateHTMLTag()` to validate the HTML tag before use. This helps prevent XSS by sanitizing user input and only allowing valid HTML tags.
