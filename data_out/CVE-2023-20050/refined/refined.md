- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of arguments passed to specific CLI commands in Cisco NX-OS Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the currently logged-in user. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by including crafted input as an argument to an affected CLI command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user on the affected device.
