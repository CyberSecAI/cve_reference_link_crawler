| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2208849#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2023-05-21 14:46:04 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in fs/ksmbd/connection.c in ksmbd in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, but only systems with ksmbd enabled are vulnerable.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of SMB2_SESSION_SETUP commands. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.  Reference: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f5c779b7ddbda30866cf2a27c63e34158f858c73> <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-698/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2208849#c1)  Rohit Keshri    2023-05-21 14:58:27 UTC  ``` There was no shipped kernel version were seen affected with this problem. These files are not built in our source code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2208849#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-05-21 19:41:23 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-32250>   ``` |  |
