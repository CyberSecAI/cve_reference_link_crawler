- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the video endpoint xAPI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could read and write arbitrary files in the system and escalate privileges from *admin* to *root*.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the xAPI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs an *Administrator* account and local access to the device.
