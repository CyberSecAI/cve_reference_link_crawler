- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application which is then stored and executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability, but it requires user interaction (victim must click a malicious link/interact with malicious content).
