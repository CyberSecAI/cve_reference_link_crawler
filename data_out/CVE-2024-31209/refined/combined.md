# Atom Exhaustion in provider configuration worker ets table location

Moderate

[maennchen](/maennchen)
published
GHSA-mj35-2rgf-cv8p
Apr 3, 2024

## Package

erlang

oidcc
([Erlang](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aerlang))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.0.2, 3.1.2, 3.2.0-beta.3

## Description

### Impact

DOS by Atom exhaustion is possible by calling `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_provider_configuration/1` or `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_jwks/1`.

Since the name is usually provided as a static value in the application using `oidcc`, this is unlikely to be exploited.

### Details

Example to illustrate the vulnerability.

```
{ok, Claims} =
  oidcc:retrieve_userinfo(
    Token,
    myapp_oidcc_config_provider,
    <<"client_id">>,
    <<"client_secret">>,
    #{}
  )
```

The vulnerability is present in `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_ets_table_name/1`.

The function `get_ets_table_name` is calling `erlang:list_to_atom/1`.

[oidcc/src/oidcc\_provider\_configuration\_worker.erl](https://github.com/erlef/oidcc/blob/018dbb53dd752cb1e331637d8e0e6a489ba1fae9/src/oidcc_provider_configuration_worker.erl#L385-L388)

Lines 385 to 388
in
[018dbb5](/erlef/oidcc/commit/018dbb53dd752cb1e331637d8e0e6a489ba1fae9)

|  | get\_ets\_table\_name(WorkerName) when is\_atom(WorkerName) -> |
| --- | --- |
|  | {ok, erlang:list\_to\_atom(erlang:atom\_to\_list(WorkerName) ++ "\_table")}; |
|  | get\_ets\_table\_name(\_Ref) -> |
|  | error. |

There might be a case (Very highly improbable) where the 2nd argument of

`oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_*/1` is called with a different atom each time which eventually leads to

the atom table filling up and the node crashing.

### Patches

Patched in `3.0.2`, `3.1.2` & `3.2.0-beta.3`

### Workarounds

Make sure only valid provider configuration worker names are passed to the functions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
