Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_ets_table_name/1` function, which uses `erlang:list_to_atom/1` to generate an ETS table name. If a different atom is passed as the worker name each time the function is called, it can lead to the exhaustion of the atom table, causing the node to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Atom Exhaustion:** The core vulnerability is the unbounded creation of atoms by `erlang:list_to_atom/1`. Erlang's atom table has a fixed size, and if filled, it can crash the Erlang node.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly calling `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_provider_configuration/1` or `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_jwks/1` with a different atom each time as the worker name, an attacker can exhaust the atom table, leading to a crash of the Erlang node, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local and requires high privileges to exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call functions such as `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_provider_configuration/1` or `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_jwks/1`.
- The attacker must have the ability to influence the worker name passed as an argument, and can pass a different atom as the worker name each time.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "highly improbable" to be exploited in normal use cases because the worker name is usually a static value.
- The fix includes ensuring that the worker name is an atom and not a dynamic value that changes each time.
- Patches have been released in versions `3.0.2`, `3.1.2`, and `3.2.0-beta.3`.
- The CVSS score is 5.3, with the following metrics:
    - Attack Vector: Local
    - Attack Complexity: High
    - Privileges Required: High
    - User Interaction: None
    - Scope: Changed
    - Confidentiality: None
    - Integrity: None
    - Availability: High

The fix commit modifies the `get_ets_table_name` to return the atom if it's passed as a parameter rather than converting it to a list and back to an atom. The patch also changed `register_ets_table` to use the passed in name rather than creating a new one.
