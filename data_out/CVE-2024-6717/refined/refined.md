- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper path restriction during archive unpacking of artifacts within Nomad allocation directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability during archive extraction, allowing writing outside the intended allocation directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can craft malicious archives that, when unpacked by Nomad, write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended allocation directory. This could lead to various impacts, including overwriting critical system files, escalating privileges, or causing denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a malicious archive file to Nomad through the artifact block, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability during the unpacking process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to submit a job specification with a malicious artifact to Nomad.
