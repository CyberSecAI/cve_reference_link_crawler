Subject: CVE-2024-26578: Apache Answer: Repeated submission at registration
 created duplicate users with the same name

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Answer through 1.2.1

Description:

Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability in Apache Answer.This issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.2.1.

Repeated submission during registration resulted in the registration of the same user. When users register, if they rapidly submit multiple registrations using scripts, it can result in the creation of multiple user accounts simultaneously with the same name.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version [1.2.5], which fixes the issue.
