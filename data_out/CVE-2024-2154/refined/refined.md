The provided content describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Sourcecodester Mobile Management Store application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input in the `view_product.php` file within a SQL query. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly included in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization when processing the `id` parameter in `view_product.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive database information by injecting malicious SQL queries.
  - Attackers can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
  - An attacker could use this vulnerability to bypass authentication or gain control of the application's database server.

**Attack vectors:**
  - The vulnerability is exposed through the `id` parameter in the URL when requesting the `view_product.php` page via an HTTP GET request.
  - The attacker can inject malicious SQL code directly into the URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, it is unauthenticated.
  - The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
