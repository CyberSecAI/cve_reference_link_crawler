- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Name` field of a custom object in the App Builder module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). A crafted payload injected into the `Name` field of a custom object is not properly sanitized and is rendered in the application, allowing execution of arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious payload into the `Name` field of an App Builder custom object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, specifically, the ability to create and modify custom objects within the App Builder module. The UI must also render the object's name, triggering the XSS.
