- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of X_B or X_T files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. This results in a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious X_B or X_T file or visits a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious X_B or X_T file to the user or trick them into visiting a malicious page. User interaction is required for exploitation.
