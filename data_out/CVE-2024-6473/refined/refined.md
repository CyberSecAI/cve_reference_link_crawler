- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the usage of an untrusted search path when loading DLLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL Hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where Yandex Browser searches for DLLs, and have it loaded instead of the legitimate one. This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system if the attacker gains sufficient privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL with the name of a DLL that Yandex Browser attempts to load.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a directory where the browser searches for DLLs before a legitimate DLL with the same name is loaded. This is typically achieved by placing the malicious DLL in a folder higher up in the search path.
