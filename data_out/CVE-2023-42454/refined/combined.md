# Public exposure of database credentials

Critical

[lovasoa](/lovasoa)
published
GHSA-v5wf-jg37-r9m5
Sep 18, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<0.11.1

## Patched versions

0.11.1

## Description

### Impact

If

* you are using a SQLPage version older than v0.11.1
* your SQLPage instance is exposed publicly
* the database connection string is specified in the `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration file (not in an environment variable)
* the web\_root is the current working directory (the default)
* your database is exposed publicly

then an attacker could retrieve the database connection information from SQLPage and use it to connect to your database directly.

### Patches

Upgrade to [v0.11.1](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/releases/tag/v0.11.1) as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade immediately:

* Using an environment variable instead of the configuration file to specify the database connection string prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions.
* Using a different [web root](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/blob/main/configuration.md) (that is not a parent of the SQLPage configuration directory) fixes the issue.
* And in any case, you should generally avoid exposing your database publicly

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| With the browser, we can download the files in the sqlpage folder. For example, it's possible to read the `sqlpage.json` configuration file. It's a security problem. The sqlpage folder must be keep hidden.  It's possible to set rewrite rules on the proxy side to block the download. But, I think that it will be cool to filter url in sqlpage server. |

| Thank you very much for the report. The check was removed during a refactoring and we missed it because we didn't have a test for it. I'll release a new version today. |
