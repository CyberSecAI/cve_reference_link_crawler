- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AWSOM News Announcement plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed on the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will be executed when other users visit the compromised site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is introduced through the plugin itself, likely when it renders user-supplied input. An administrator level access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrator privileges.
