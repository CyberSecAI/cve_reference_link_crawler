"text": "A vulnerability in the Disaster Recovery framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service (Unified CM IM&P), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions they should not be able to.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient access control checks on the affected device. An attacker with read-only privileges could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific vulnerable command on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a set of administrative actions they should not be able to.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"
