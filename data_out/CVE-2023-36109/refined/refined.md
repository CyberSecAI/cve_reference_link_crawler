Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-36109:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow within the `ecma_stringbuilder_append_raw` function located in `jerry-core/ecma/base/ecma-helpers-string.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow. The `ecma_stringbuilder_append_raw` function, when appending data, does not correctly check if the destination buffer has sufficient space to hold the appended data, leading to a potential overwrite of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, which can cause various issues such as:
    *   Application crash due to memory access violations.
    *   Arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted input is provided to overwrite specific areas of memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript `String.replace()` with a crafted RegExp:** The vulnerability is triggered using the JavaScript `String.replace()` method. By providing a specially crafted regular expression object with a custom `exec` function, an attacker can control the arguments to `ecma_builtin_replace_substitute`, which leads to the vulnerable `ecma_stringbuilder_append_raw` call.
*   **Specifically Crafted RegExp Object:** The regular expression object's `exec` function must return a specific object that leads to an incorrect size calculation, ultimately causing the overflow in `ecma_stringbuilder_append_raw`. The vulnerability is triggered when the return value of exec is like: `{ 0: "1234567", length: 1, index: 0 }`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an environment running the vulnerable JerryScript version. This could be through a web browser, a server-side JavaScript environment, or any application that uses JerryScript.
*  **Control over Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the regular expression provided to the `String.replace()` function and provide the specific return value for the regex `exec` method.
*   **Understanding of the vulnerable code paths:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the string replacement operation in JerryScript works and how a crafted regular expression can lead to the vulnerable code path to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided build flags include address sanitization (`-fsanitize=address`) which was helpful in detecting the vulnerability as it detects memory errors like buffer overflows.
*   The issue was found in `JerryScript` version `v3.0.0`.
*   The provided test case code is:
    ```javascript
    let evil = new RegExp();
    evil.exec = () => ({ 0: "1234567", length: 1, index: 0 });
    "abc".replace(evil, "$'");
    ```
