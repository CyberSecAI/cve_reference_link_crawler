Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-2778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of `SSLParameters` within the `setAlgorithmConstraints()` method in OpenJDK's Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:**  The `setAlgorithmConstraints()` method, which should enforce security policies regarding cryptographic algorithms, does not properly handle the provided SSL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Policy Bypass:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to override the system's defined security policy, potentially forcing the use of weak or disabled cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Weakened Encryption:**  The successful exploitation could result in using weak crypto algorithms that should be disabled thus weakening the overall encryption strength.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTPS connections, indicating network-based attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to establish a network connection to the vulnerable application or system utilizing the affected OpenJDK version.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (Possible):** The description suggests the vulnerability is in the handling of the SSL parameters. This could imply that the attacker might need to be in a position to intercept and modify the parameters of an SSL connection.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected versions**: Java SE versions 11.0.6 and 14 are vulnerable, while Java SE versions 7u251, 8u241 and Java SE Embedded 8u241 are not.
*   The vulnerability is listed as having a CVSS score of 3.7 (LOW), with the vector being CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates a network-based attack, with high attack complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, no scope change, with a low impact to confidentiality, no impact to integrity and no impact to availability.
*   Multiple vendors, including NetApp, openSUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu, have identified this vulnerability and issued patches or updates.
*   Oracle lists Peter Dettman of cryptoworkshop.com as having reported the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in OpenJDK version jdk-11.0.7+10.

In summary, CVE-2020-2778 describes a flaw in OpenJDK where an attacker can bypass security restrictions in the JSSE component and weaken the encryption in network communication.
