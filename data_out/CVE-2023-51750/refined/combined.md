# Status: Open (As on 03-Dec-2023)

CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H = 7.1 ( **High Severity**)

Multiple CVE-2023–50159, CVE-2023–51748, CVE-2023–51749, CVE-2023–51750, CVE-2023–51751

**Impacted Component**: ScaleFusion (Windows Desktop App) agent v10.5.2

**Assumption:** Enterprise wants to only allow running MS Edge in the system and block all other unwanted application/scripts execution in the system via Scalefusion kiosk solution.

**Configuration:** Windows agent based Kiosk mode configured to allow only launching of MS Edge in browser mode. Even prevent user from launching custom URL via blocked address bar. [How to Set up Microsoft Edge Kiosk Mode? — Scalefusion](https://blog.scalefusion.com/how-to-set-up-microsoft-edge-in-kiosk-mode-on-windows-10/).

**Vulnerability Description**: It was observed that despite configuring complete restriction for any unwanted application/script via Scalefusion windows agent based Browser KIOSK hardening, there were so many alternate methods via which Kiosk mode can be bypassed easily and allowing complete access to the system.

**Impact**:
Loss of data confidentiality/Integrity/Availability (Sensitive info. can be stolen, arbitrary code can be executed, users can be phished, important files can be erased, etc.). Defying sole concept of browser based kiosk mode.

**Exploitability Rational**:
User (attacker) can have any admin/non-admin privilege based on how kiosk was configured. Attacker needs to have system access, no specific user privilege required as KIOSK is auto login user. (Verified on Windows10, Applicable to all Win versions)

**Steps to Reproduce**:

**Method1:**

1. Key combination Ctrl+S or Ctrl+O brings Windows File picker dialog. Where in once can access all file partitions and via address bar execute commands as well.

**Method2:**

1. Via mouse/touch screen highlight any word, which brings tool tip to search that word via MS Edge. Click on that to open adjacent tab with new bing search
2. Search via keywords or direct URL which is to be opened and select from the results.
3. OR Click on Open link in new tab to view it in full screen

**Method3:**

1. Via bing search or above technique navigate to any host which allows file download.
2. Upon download automatically Windows file explorer (file picker dialog box)would appear for Save As option, which would allow unrestricted filesystem access
3. Left menu bar there would be multiple list items, from that Right click on ‘This PC’ > Open in new window. This will open a file fledged Window File explorer to give unrestricted access to the system

**Method4:**

1. While browser is open, Press Alt+F4 multiple times. This would kill the Edge browser, agent restarting it and give Windows access.
2. Press Win key to view start menu. There by open any desired application. (In case if Edge restarts, Alt+Tab you can switch back to previously launched application again)

**Take Away**:

We should be always ready for various tricks due to client side security controls. (there is no silver bullet to solve such issues)

To make things a little difficult, adapt whitelisting approach over blacklisting approach.

Make use of rules based on digital signature + location + filehash

2. The newly opened applet is control panel Power Options. There by open write from the address bar for wordpad (write.exe is binary for wordpad).

3. Type any command what is to be executed and select Save As option. Choose location for e.g. documents folder and name the file “script.bat” (Double quotes are essential to bypass type selection from the drop down for wordpad). Upon Saving the file if prompt asking save in other format comes, click Yes.

4. Once again from address bar start typing path where above file was saved. Notice that automatically you will get suggestion of internal file/folders. e.g. C:\Users\kiosk1\Documents\script.bat . And press enter to execute the batch file.

5. Notice duplicatecmd.exe got copied in documents folder.

6. Once again from the address bar start typing the path where we tried to copy command prompt file i.e. C:\Users\kiosk1\Documents\duplicatecmd.exe and press enter. Notice that command prompt works without any interruption.

**Method10:**

1. Key combination Ctrl+S or Ctrl+O brings Windows File picker dialog. Where in once can access all file partitions and via address bar execute commands as well.

**Take Away**:

We should be always ready for various tricks due to client side security controls. (there is no silver bullet to solve such issues)

## Introduction

As a part of Scalefusion’s vulnerability disclosure program we encourage third party developers, testers and security researchers to perform security testing and report/disclose the issues to us. We actively work with such reporters and resolve the issues as per the priorities and classification.

As part of this process, we were recently notified of an issue in the **Scalefusion Windows MDM Agent**. While we were actively working on resolving the problem, the researcher publicly disclosed the issue. Apart from the reported matter, four additional issues were disclosed without prior reporting.

We treat our Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) with utmost seriousness and expect researchers to adhere to Responsible Disclosure practices. It is our duty to transparently communicate these vulnerabilities and outline the measures taken to address them.

## List CVE’s reported

| CVE | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Our Analysis of the Findings

As per our analysis, these issues were either a result of misconfiguration or in certain cases known limitations that are documented. Here is a description of them:

### Ability to Open File Explorer:

1. **Issue Description:** The findings share a common outcome i.e. being able to open File Explorer when configuring a Multi-App Kiosk mode using the Scalefusion MDM Agent only enrollment.
2. **Root Cause:** When using Multi-App Kiosk mode, blocking File explorer results in unwanted user experience which causes blocking certain allowed apps that require the File Explorer to execute. For this reason, as a design choice, File Explorer was added to the default list of allowed apps.
3. **Fix:** However taking cognizance of the reported issue, we have now blocked File Explorer by default.
4. **Solution/Recommendation:** Please update to the latest version of Scalefusion MDM Agent.
5. **Availability of the Fix:**

   1. **Release on December 1, 2023.**
   2. **Scalefusion MDM Agent version: 10.5.6 / 10.5.7**
6. **Impact of the Fix:** In your deployments, if you have allowed applications which require File Explorer, then please add this as an allowed app in the Device profile.

### Ability to open non-allowed Websites

1. **Issue Description:** Researcher was able to open websites that are not allowed.
2. **Root Cause:** The feature of allow/block websites is provided by Modern management. Since the device was enrolled only via Scalefusion MDM Agent and modern management was not enabled, the researcher was able to browse not allowed websites.
3. **Fix:** There were no fixes done from our side as this was a misconfiguration issue.
4. **Solution/Recommendation:** Scalefusion offers ADMX configurations for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge that allows IT Admins to set browsing policies. This requires the device to be managed via modern management, and this can be achieved either during enrollment via Browser/Autopilot or via Agent driven enrollment.

> Please refer to our [enrollment documents](/docs/enrolling-company-owned-windows-10-and-above-devices) and how to configure [Browser policies](/docs/configure-google-chrome-or-microsoft-edge-on-windows-10-and-above-devices) to harden your device profile and policies.

## Summary and recommendations

Below are our recommendations on the findings:

1. **CVE-2023-51751, CVE-2023-51748, and CVE-2023-50159:** These issues were fixed in the Scalefusion Windows agent version 10.5.7 by preventing the launching of the file explorer in Agent-based Multi-App and Single App Kiosk mode.
2. **CVE-2023-51750 and CVE-2023-51749:** These were not found vulnerable if the default Windows device profile configuration is used which utilizes modern management with website allow-listing rules.

Hence, users are requested to use an up-to-date version of the [Scalefusion MDM Agent application](/docs/scalefusion-mdm-agent-application) from the Enterprise store.
