| | CWE Glossary Definition | x | | --- | --- | |  | |      CWE-193: Off-by-one Error  | Weakness ID: 193 [Vulnerability Mapping](#Vulnerability_Mapping_Notes_193): ALLOWED This CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities    Abstraction: Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | | --- |    View customized information:  Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  Operational For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  Mapping Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.    × Edit Custom Filter Conceptual Operational Mapping Friendly Select All     Reset Clear Submit Cancel       + Description  A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.    + Alternate Terms  | off-by-five: | An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error. | | --- | --- |       + Common Consequences Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Scope | Impact | Likelihood | | --- | --- | --- | | Availability | Technical Impact: *DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory); DoS: Instability*  This weakness will generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. In the case of overflows involving loop index variables, the likelihood of infinite loops is also high. |  | | Integrity | Technical Impact: *Modify Memory*  If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the wrap around results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur. |  | | Confidentiality | Technical Impact: *Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; Bypass Protection Mechanism*  This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy. |  |      + Potential Mitigations  | Phase: Implementation When copying character arrays or using character manipulation methods, the correct size parameter must be used to account for the null terminator that needs to be added at the end of the array. Some examples of functions susceptible to this weakness in C include strcpy(), strncpy(), strcat(), strncat(), printf(), sprintf(), scanf() and sscanf(). | | --- |       +  Relationships  Section Help This table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.  + Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)  | Nature | Type | ID | Name | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ChildOf | Pillar Pillar - a weakness that is the most abstract type of weakness and represents a theme for all class/base/variant weaknesses related to it.

The Phase identifies a point in the life cycle at which introduction may occur, while the Note provides a typical scenario related to introduction during the given phase.  | Phase | Note | | --- | --- | | Implementation |  |      + Applicable Platforms Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance. Languages  Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)      + Demonstrative Examples  Example 1  The following code allocates memory for a maximum number of widgets. It then gets a user-specified number of widgets, making sure that the user does not request too many. It then initializes the elements of the array using InitializeWidget(). Because the number of widgets can vary for each request, the code inserts a NULL pointer to signify the location of the last widget.  (bad code) Example Language: C    int i;     However, this code contains an off-by-one calculation error ([CWE-193](/data/definitions/193.html)). It allocates exactly enough space to contain the specified number of widgets, but it does not include the space for the NULL pointer. As a result, the allocated buffer is smaller than it is supposed to be ([CWE-131](/data/definitions/131.html)). So if the user ever requests MAX\_NUM\_WIDGETS, there is an out-of-bounds write ([CWE-787](/data/definitions/787.html)) when the NULL is assigned. Depending on the environment and compilation settings, this could cause memory corruption.  Example 2  In this example, the code does not account for the terminating null character, and it writes one byte beyond the end of the buffer.  The first call to strncat() appends up to 20 characters plus a terminating null character to fullname[]. There is plenty of allocated space for this, and there is no weakness associated with this first call. However, the second call to strncat() potentially appends another 20 characters. The code does not account for the terminating null character that is automatically added by strncat(). This terminating null character would be written one byte beyond the end of the fullname[] buffer. Therefore an off-by-one error exists with the second strncat() call, as the third argument should be 19.  (bad code) Example Language: C    char firstname[20];     When using a function like strncat() one must leave a free byte at the end of the buffer for a terminating null character, thus avoiding the off-by-one weakness. Additionally, the last argument to strncat() is the number of characters to append, which must be less than the remaining space in the buffer. Be careful not to just use the total size of the buffer.  (good code) Example Language: C    char firstname[20];char lastname[20];char fullname[40];fullname[0] = '\0';strncat(fullname, firstname, sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1);strncat(fullname, lastname, sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1);      Example 3  The Off-by-one error can also be manifested when reading characters from a character array within a for loop that has an incorrect continuation condition.  (bad code) Example Language: C    #define PATH\_SIZE 60     In this case, the correct continuation condition is shown below.  (good code) Example Language: C    for(i=0; i<PATH\_SIZE; i++) {...      Example 4  As another example the Off-by-one error can occur when using the sprintf library function to copy a string variable to a formatted string variable and the original string variable comes from an untrusted source. As in the following example where a local function, setFilename is used to store the value of a filename to a database but first uses sprintf to format the filename. The setFilename function includes an input parameter with the name of the file that is used as the copy source in the sprintf function. The sprintf function will copy the file name to a char array of size 20 and specifies the format of the new variable as 16 characters followed by the file extension .dat.  (bad code) Example Language: C    int setFilename(char \*filename) {char name[20];}     However this will cause an Off-by-one error if the original filename is exactly 16 characters or larger because the format of 16 characters with the file extension is exactly 20 characters and does not take into account the required null terminator that will be placed at the end of the string.      + Observed Examples  | Reference | Description | | --- | --- | | [CVE-2003-0252](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0252) | Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines. | | [CVE-2001-1391](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1391) | Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory. | | [CVE-2002-0083](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0083) | Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges. | | [CVE-2002-0653](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0653) | Off-by-one buffer overflow in function usd by server allows local users to execute arbitrary code as the server user via .htaccess files with long entries. | | [CVE-2002-0844](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0844) | Off-by-one buffer overflow in version control system allows local users to execute arbitrary code. | | [CVE-1999-1568](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1568) | Off-by-one error in FTP server allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long PORT command. | | [CVE-2004-0346](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0346) | Off-by-one buffer overflow in FTP server allows local users to gain privileges via a 1024 byte RETR command. | | [CVE-2004-0005](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0005) | Multiple buffer overflows in chat client allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code. | | [CVE-2003-0356](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0356) | Multiple off-by-one vulnerabilities in product allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code. | | [CVE-2001-1496](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1496) | Off-by-one buffer overflow in server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code. | | [CVE-2004-0342](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0342) | This is an interesting example that might not be an off-by-one. | | [CVE-2001-0609](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0609) | An off-by-one enables a terminating null to be overwritten, which causes 2 strings to be merged and enable a format string. | | [CVE-2002-1745](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1745) | Off-by-one error allows source code disclosure of files with 4 letter extensions that match an accepted 3-letter extension. | | [CVE-2002-1816](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1816) | Off-by-one buffer overflow. | | [CVE-2002-1721](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1721) | Off-by-one error causes an snprintf call to overwrite a critical internal variable with a null value. | | [CVE-2003-0466](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0466) | Off-by-one error in function used in many products leads to a buffer overflow during pathname management, as demonstrated using multiple commands in an FTP server. | | [CVE-2003-0625](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0625) | Off-by-one error allows read of sensitive memory via a malformed request. | | [CVE-2006-4574](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4574) | Chain: security monitoring product has an off-by-one error that leads to unexpected length values, triggering an assertion. |       + Detection Methods  | Automated Static Analysis Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)  Effectiveness: High | | --- |       + Memberships  Section HelpThis MemberOf Relationships table shows additional CWE Categories and Views that reference this weakness as a member.
