- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When traffic other than HTTP/S (e.g., SSH) traverses FortiOS on ports 80/443 with transparent proxy enabled, the traffic is not redirected to the transparent proxy policy for processing because it lacks a valid HTTP header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. The device fails to properly process non-HTTP/S traffic on HTTP/S ports when a transparent proxy is enabled, allowing such traffic to bypass security policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass security policies by sending non-HTTP/S traffic on port 80/443 when the transparent proxy is enabled. This could potentially allow malicious traffic to reach internal networks or systems, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending non-HTTP/S traffic on ports 80 or 443 to a FortiOS device with transparent proxy enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send traffic to a FortiOS device with a transparent proxy enabled, and should be able to send traffic that is not HTTP/S. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
