## D-Link DIR-3040 prog.cgi SetQuickVPNSettings Password Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-1325ZDI-CAN-21617

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-41217](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41217) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.1, [AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [DIR-3040](https://us.dlink.com/en/products/dir-3040-smart-ac3000-high-power-wi-fi-tri-band-gigabit-router) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-3040 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the prog.cgi binary, which handles HNAP requests made to the lighttpd webserver listening on TCP ports 80 and 443. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | D-Link has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

DIR-3040 :: H/W Rev. Ax :: F/W v120B03 :: Stack-Based Overflow flaw in the prog.cgi that coule elevate to multiple attack vectors

**Overview**

Starting on July 5, 2023, 3rd party security research from TrendMicro ZDI reported a series reports for the DIR-3040 hardware rev. Ax, firmware  v120B03 and below as having multiple security vulnerabilities

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
