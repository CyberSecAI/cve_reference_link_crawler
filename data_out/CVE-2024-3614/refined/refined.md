Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of HTML entity encoding of user-supplied data before being inserted into HTML input field `value` attributes. Specifically, the variables `$nama_customer`, `$alamat_customer`, and `$notelp_customer` are directly inserted into the `value` attribute without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable input fields, which will then be executed by the browser of any user viewing the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user visits the vulnerable page (`customer.php`).
- This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing cookies/session information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker would exploit the vulnerable input fields in the `customer.php` to inject malicious JavaScript.
- The attacker would need to input malicious data into fields associated with `$nama_customer`, `$alamat_customer`, and `$notelp_customer`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the web application which will then be stored in the database and subsequently rendered in the `customer.php` page.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in `customer.php` of Sourcecodester Warehouse Management System v1.0.
- The variables `$nama_customer`, `$alamat_customer`, and `$notelp_customer` are vulnerable.
