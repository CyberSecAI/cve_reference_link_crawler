- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This occurs when the application opens a tampered log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to the lack of proper bounds checking when processing log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Limited impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the HMI. The vulnerability could result in memory corruption when an authenticated user opens a tampered log file.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a tampered log file within GP-Pro EX.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user needs to open a tampered log file. The attacker needs the ability to create or modify log files.
