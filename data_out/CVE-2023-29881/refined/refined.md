Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-29881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `index_f()` function of `phpok64/framework/api/call_control.php`.
- The `index_f()` function calls the `phpok()` function, which involves a dynamic function call.
- While callable function names are stored in the database, the `_arclist` function, which can be invoked by the dynamic call, is vulnerable.
- The `_arclist` function can call `_arc_condition`, which has conditional SQL statement splicing.
- Input sanitization is present but bypassable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in the `_arc_condition` function. Input is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Dynamic Function Call:** The use of dynamic function calls provides a vector for exploiting the `_arclist` function.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to filter input by escaping characters like ',<, and > and other input validation. However these sanitization measures are insufficient and can be bypassed with a crafted payload, allowing malicious SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, as the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information can be leaked by querying database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a crafted JSON formatted POST request to `/api.php?c=call&f=index`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
- **No Authentication required:** No login or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `phpok64/framework/api/call_control.php` and `framework/phpok_call.php`.
- The payload is constructed to exploit the way fields_need is processed, injecting a SQL CASE statement to create a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `_arc_condition` function processes the attacker-controlled `fields_need` parameter.

**Exploit:**
The attacker provides a JSON payload with a crafted `fields_need` parameter, such as:
```
{"m_picplayer":{"_alias":"abc","fields_need":"CASE 1 WHEN (substr((select database()) from 1 for 1)=0x70) THEN sleep(5) ELSE 1 END"}}
```
This payload leverages the SQL `CASE` statement to introduce a time delay if the condition (database name starts with 'p') is true, demonstrating successful SQL injection.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content also includes a python script to automate the extraction of the database name by exploiting the time-based SQL injection.
- The vulnerability was reported by "northind" on March 18, 2023, and has been fixed by the vendor, "qinggan", with an update that users should implement.
