In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: tc358767: Check if fully initialized before signalling HPD event via IRQ

Make sure the connector is fully initialized before signalling any
HPD events via drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event(), otherwise this may
lead to NULL pointer dereference.
