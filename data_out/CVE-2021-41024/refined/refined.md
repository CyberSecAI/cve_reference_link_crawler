- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A relative path traversal vulnerability exists in FortiOS and FortiProxy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a relative path traversal (CWE-23), allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web root.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject path traversal character sequences in the GET request of the login page, potentially disclosing sensitive information of the server. The impact is listed as "Escalation of privilege" in the provided information, but the description states that information disclosure is the primary impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a GET request to the login page of the affected FortiOS and FortiProxy versions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication, and can be an external actor since the vulnerability is accessible through a GET request on the login page, as stated "unauthenticated, unauthorized attacker".
