| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1973349#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-17 16:40:23 UTC  ``` An integer overflow was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device. It could occur while handling a "PVRDMA_REG_DSRHIGH" write from the guest due to improper input validation. More specifically, the init_dev_ring() function in pvrdma_main.c does not validate the guest supplied 'num_pages' which is subsequently decremented and used in pvrdma_ring_init() to allocate dynamic memory via g_malloc(). This could result in a NULL pointer dereference issue (if g_malloc returns NULL) or allocation of large amount of memory and out-of-bounds read access. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.  static int init_dev_ring(..., uint32_t num_pages) {   ...   rc = pvrdma_ring_init(..., (dma_addr_t)num_pages - 1); // guest may provide num_pages = 0   ... }  int pvrdma_ring_init(..., uint32_t npages) {   ...   ring->pages = g_malloc(npages * sizeof(void *)); // npages may be -1 here   for (i = 0; i < npages; i++) {     ...     ring->pages[i] = rdma_pci_dma_map(dev, tbl[i], TARGET_PAGE_SIZE);   ... }   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1973349#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-17 16:40:56 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1973352](show_bug.cgi?id=1973352 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3607 qemu: pvrdma: unchecked malloc size due to integer overflow in init_dev_ring() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1973349#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-17 21:03:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
