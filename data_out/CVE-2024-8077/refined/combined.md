# Device info

**Device name**: AC1200 T8

**Version**: V4.1.5cu.862\_B20230228

**Firmware download**: <https://www.totolink.net/home/menu/detail/menu_listtpl/download/id/222/ids/36.html>

# OS command injection in **setDiagnosisCfg**

## Root-cause

* Command `ping` is crafted using `sprintf` and executed using function `system`. An attacker can craft specific payload to manipulate system's command.
* Function `Validity_check` that checks if variable contains any special characters. This function can be bypassed allowing attacker inject custom commands.

## Recommendations

* Use function `execve` instead of `system`

# Buffer overflow in **setDiagnosisCfg**

# Root-cause

* Variable that's used to craft command is an array that has length 128. Firmware is using functino `sprintf` to craft a string and save this string to array without checking variable's size.

## Recommendations

* Use function `snprintf` that checks length of destination variable

# OS command injection in **setTracerouteCfg**

## Root-cause

* Command `traceroute` is crafted using `sprintf` and executed using function `system`. An attacker can craft specific payload to manipulate system's command.
* Function `Validity_check` that checks if variable contains any special characters. This function can be bypassed allowing attacker inject custom commands.

## Recommendations

* Use function `snprintf` that checks length of destination variable

# OS command injection in exportOvpn

## Root-cause

* When user request has value of `action` is `exportOvpn` and value of `type` is `user`, value of third parameter is passed to `snprintf` to make a full command. This command is executed in function `system`. An attacker can craft specific payload to manipulate system's command
* Function `Validity_check` that checks if variable contains any special characters. This function can be bypassed allowing attacker inject custom commands.

## Recommendations

* Use function `execve` instead of `system`
