| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1962836#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-05-20 16:36:53 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the Caribou onscreen keyboard could be made to crash when given certain input values. An attacker could use this to bypass screen-locking applications that support using Caribou as an input mechanism.

An attacker could use this to bypass > screen-locking applications that support using Caribou as an input mechanism.  Specifically, this was first reported in the on-screen keyboard which runs within the Cinnamon process and uses libcaribou. Pressing ē led to a Cinnamon crash and possible screensaver lock bypass.  Cinnamon issue: <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-screensaver/issues/354>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1962836#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-05-26 14:58:14 UTC  ``` It is worth noting that caribou is only shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (caribou-0.4.21) while cinnamon-screensaver is not shipped in Red Hat products.   ``` |  |
