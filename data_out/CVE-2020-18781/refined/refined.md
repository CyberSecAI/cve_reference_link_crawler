The content is related to CVE-2020-18781.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `FilePOSIX::read` function within `File.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow. The `FilePOSIX::read` function is writing past the allocated memory boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. The provided ASAN output indicates the write of size 2 occurs at an address outside the allocated 1160 byte region.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted WAV file (`poc.wav`) using the `sfconvert` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted WAV file to the `sfconvert` utility.
