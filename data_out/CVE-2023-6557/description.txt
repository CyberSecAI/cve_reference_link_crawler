The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.8.2 via the route function hooked into wp_ajax_nopriv_tribe_dropdown. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract potentially sensitive data including post titles and IDs of pending, private and draft posts.
