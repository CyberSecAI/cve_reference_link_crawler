Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `lhc_web/modules/lhfaq/faqwidget.php` file. Specifically, the "search" parameter was not being filtered for template syntax (`{{` and `}}`), allowing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `search` parameter before processing it within a template engine.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** While the application uses `strip_tags` function, it's not sufficient to prevent SSTI as it only removes HTML and PHP tags, not template syntax.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with low-level user privileges can exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious template expressions.
- This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `search` GET parameter in the URL, specifically the `lhc_web/index.php/site_admin/` path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a low-privilege user account on the system.
- They need to be able to craft malicious URL requests with template expressions in the `search` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in LiveHelperChat version 4.28v.
- The fix involves removing the template syntax before processing the search query in two files.
    - `lhc_web/design/defaulttheme/tpl/lhchat/onlineusers/section_online_users.tpl.php`
    - `lhc_web/modules/lhfaq/faqwidget.php`

The vulnerability was reported in issue #2054 and fixed in commit `a61d231`.
