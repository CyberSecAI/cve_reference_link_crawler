| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-04 12:31:36 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1213330](show_bug.cgi?id=1213330 "RESOLVED FIXED")  I just reported this to upstream via email:  This file is used if Wine is installed on the system and when the Wine ASIO related settings are changed and applied in the Cadence GUI dialog. In Cadence.py the following code deals with it:  ```     if "wineasio" in self.settings_changed_types:         REGFILE  = 'REGEDIT4\n'         REGFILE += '\n'         REGFILE += '[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineASIO]\n'         REGFILE += '"Autostart server"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_autostart.isChecked() else 0)         REGFILE += '"Connect to hardware"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_hw.isChecked() else 0)         REGFILE += '"Fixed buffersize"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_fixed_bsize.isChecked() else 0)         REGFILE += '"Number of inputs"=dword:000000%s\n' % smartHex(self.sb_wineasio_ins.value(), 2)         REGFILE += '"Number of outputs"=dword:000000%s\n' % smartHex(self.sb_wineasio_outs.value(), 2)         REGFILE += '"Preferred buffersize"=dword:0000%s\n' % smartHex(int(self.cb_wineasio_bsizes.currentText()), 4)                  writeFile = open("/tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg", "w")         writeFile.write(REGFILE)         writeFile.close()                  os.system("regedit /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg") ```  Without the Linux kernel's symlink protection (`fs.protected_symlinks` sysctl) this would allow other users to stage a symlink attack. Thus other users could point /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg to a compromised file, or have the user running Cadence create this file in an arbitrary location.  Without the Linux kernel's regular file proection (`fs.protected_regular` sysctl) this would allow other users to place an attacker controlled world-writable file in this location. By winning a race condition (waiting for Cadence to write its desired content and then quickly replacing the file's content again) the attacker can cause arbitrary data to be passed to `regedit`. Since the Wine registry controls ample application behaviour this can be considered a local arbitrary code execution.  Luckily most modern Linux distrubtions have the kernel protections mentioned above enabled which means that the worst case will usually not happen. Even with these protection mechanisms the following problems remain:  - Cadence can be prevented from saving Wine ASIO settings by pre-creating this   file. - The file is created world-readable by Cadence, thus the content of the file   can leak to other user contexts on the system. The data that is   written there is not sensitive at the moment, but it could become   problematic in in the future. - (non-security) the fixed /tmp file path makes it impossible to properly run   two instances of Cadence in parallel, especially since the file is never   deleted again.  The fix for this one is easy, this needs to use Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-22 13:01:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 868937](attachment.cgi?id=868937 "fix for the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=868937&action=edit "fix for the issue") fix for the issue ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-22 13:08:39 UTC  ``` While the upstream author still didn't reply to my suggestions he now actually archived the Cadence GitHub repository. So he seems to be serious about decomissioning the project.  This means I won't be able to offer a PR# to upstream and there won't be an upstream maintenance release with the fixes.  I'm calling off the embargo and I attached a patch containing a fix for the issue in [attachment 868937](attachment.cgi?id=868937 "fix for the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=868937&action=edit "fix for the issue").  Simon, can you please start updates / maintenance updates containing this fix? For Tumbleweed, Leap 15.4 and Leap 15.5.  Given the situation we should also think about a route to drop Cadence in the mid term, since it obviously has no upstream any longer.  I will keep this bug private until the update process is started. Then I will publish a formal report on the oss-security mailing list to make other packagers aware of the problem. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c6)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2023-09-06 09:25:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1213985) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1109220> Backports:SLE-15-SP4 / Cadence ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c7)  Simon Lees   2023-09-06 09:49:07 UTC  ``` Should be fixed everywhere now, sorry for the delay. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c8)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2023-09-06 10:05:04 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1213985) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1109233> Backports:SLE-15-SP5 / Cadence ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-09-06 10:47:32 UTC  ``` Publishing this bug to serve as a reference for requesting a CVE for this issue from Mitre. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1213985#c10)  Marcus Meissner   2023-09-25 16:07:12 UTC  ``` openSUSE-RU-2023:0258-1: An update that has three recommended fixes can now be installed.
