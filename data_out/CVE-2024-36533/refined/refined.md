{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure permissions in volcano v1.8.2 and earlier versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and privilege escalation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can access sensitive data, escalate privileges, compromise Secrets components in Kubernetes, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
  "Attack vectors": "1. Stealing the service account token.\n2. Using the stolen token to authenticate with the API server and gain privileges.\n3. Accessing all Secrets in the cluster.\n4. Utilizing sensitive information in Secrets for further privilege escalation and cluster takeover.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to gain control of a worker node in the Kubernetes cluster, which then allows them to force the volcano pod to run on that malicious node and steal the service account token."
