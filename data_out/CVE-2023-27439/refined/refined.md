- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The New Adman WordPress plugin <= 1.6.8 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would execute when users visit the site, potentially leading to various attacks, such as user compromise or website defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via the plugin's functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script, which typically would require administrator level privileges.
