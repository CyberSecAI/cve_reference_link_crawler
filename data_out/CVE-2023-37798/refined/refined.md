Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient input sanitization in the project title field of the Vanderbilt REDCap application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application fails to properly filter or encode user-provided input when creating a project title. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code. The injected script is then stored within the application and executed when other users interact with the affected project, such as when clicking on the project title.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue stems from the application's failure to sanitize user input. Specifically, the project title field does not filter or encode HTML or JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to redirect users to a website they control.
*   **Credential Harvesting:** The attacker-controlled website could be designed to steal user credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could use the redirected site to serve malware to unsuspecting users.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in the Victim's Browser:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when the malicious payload is triggered.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web application's user interface when creating projects.
*   **Project Creation Feature:** Specifically, the vulnerability resides within the project creation functionality that is available to registered users to build surveys.
*   **Project Title Field:** The vulnerable parameter is the project title, which is editable during project creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the REDCap application.
*   **Project Creation Access:** The attacker must have the ability to create projects, which is a standard feature of the application for registered users.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects REDCap versions 13.1.35 and below.
*   A proof-of-concept payload of `<image/src/onerror=alert(‘vulnerable_To_XSS’)>` is provided as an example of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Vanderbilt released a patched version (13.8.0) to address the vulnerability.
*   The vendor quickly addressed the vulnerability once reported and released patched versions including 13.1.37 LTS, 13.7.4 SR, and 13.8.0 SR/new LTS version.
