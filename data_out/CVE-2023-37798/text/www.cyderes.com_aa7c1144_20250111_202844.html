![CVE-2023-37798: Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Vanderbilt REDCap](https://www.cyderes.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/CVE-2023-37798-Stored-Cross-Site-Scripting-in-Vanderbilt-REDCap.png)

Cyderes has discovered a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within Vanderbilt REDCap, a web application that allows users to create and manage online surveys for research purposes.

In early July 2023, Cyderes observed that version 13.1.35 and below of REDCap allows a remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary code via a project creation functionality for registered users to build surveys. For each created project, there is an editable title field that does not filter input, and this makes it possible to inject malicious JavaScript and HTML into the application.

In terms of impact, the above issue could potentially be exploited to redirect users to a website controlled by malicious actors, which may ultimately lead to credential harvesting or downloaded malware.

Keeping with industry best practices, Cyderes contacted Vanderbilt to disclose this identified vulnerability. Vanderbilt began remediation immediately and promptly released a patched version (13.8.0).

**Recommendation**

Any area of a web application that accepts and stores user input generally should not be trusted. Cyderes recommends taking appropriate measures to sanitize or encode data before being shown in a later browser response.
