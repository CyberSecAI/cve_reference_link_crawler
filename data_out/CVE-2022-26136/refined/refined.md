Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-26136:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a flaw in how Servlet Filters are handled in Atlassian products. This allows for a bypass of these filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Servlet Filter Bypass:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can bypass Servlet Filters used by both first and third-party apps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an attacker can bypass custom Servlet Filters used by third-party apps to enforce authentication. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can bypass the Servlet Filter responsible for validating Atlassian Gadgets, leading to XSS. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser if they can trick the user into requesting a malicious URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable applications.
- **Social Engineering (for XSS):** For the XSS vulnerability, an attacker must trick a user into requesting a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior access or credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They can initiate the attack remotely.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Atlassian application.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects multiple Atlassian products, including Fisheye, Crucible, Bitbucket Server and Data Center, Jira Service Management Server and Data Center, Jira Server and Data Center, Bamboo Server and Data Center, Confluence Server and Data Center, and Crowd Server and Data Center.
-   Atlassian has fixed the root cause of the vulnerability, but has not exhaustively enumerated all potential consequences.
-   The provided information states that only the authentication bypass and XSS vulnerabilities have been confirmed.
-   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.4, which is considered Critical.
-   The identified vulnerable versions and the corresponding fixed versions for each affected product are included in the content.
