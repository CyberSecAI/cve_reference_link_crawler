- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin registered several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users that exposed sensitive information. These actions used a predictable hash based on the site's URL, making it possible to generate a second hash which, when used in a subsequent AJAX request, returned sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated sensitive information disclosure. Specifically, the vulnerability stemmed from the predictable generation of hash values used to access AJAX actions. These actions returned information including the PHP version, active plugins and their versions, and an unsalted md5 hash of the site's `AUTH_KEY` and `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain potentially sensitive information about a WordPress site's configuration, such as PHP version, active plugins and their versions, and an unsalted md5 hash of the site's `AUTH_KEY` and `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`. This information could be used to plan further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted AJAX request to a specific, predictable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs knowledge of the target site URL to compute the first hash, and the code was publicly available, so no reverse engineering was required.
