Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper restrictions on file uploads, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of restrictions on the type and content of uploaded files. This allows the upload of malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts).
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The system doesn't properly validate the file type or content to ensure it is an image or prevent executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious script (e.g., a PHP webshell), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker would use the application's file upload mechanism to upload malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application's upload functionality.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application's upload form.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the "SourceCodester - Drag and Drop Image Upload without Refresh/Reload Using PHP and Ajax 1.0" application.
*   The GitHub link provided in the vuldb submission confirms the vulnerability details, referencing "Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability leads to RCE".
