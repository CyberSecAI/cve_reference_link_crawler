The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52768.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a mismatch in memory allocation size for the `vmm_table` within the `wilc1000` WiFi driver. The allocation size was not multiplied by the size of a `u32` element, leading to a smaller allocation than required.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The insufficient memory allocation for `vmm_table` caused out-of-bounds write attempts when accessing the array during transmit operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write could corrupt memory leading to system instability.
- **Kernel crash:** The KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) detected the out-of-bounds write, resulting in a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering WiFi data transmission through the `wilc1000` driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate data transmission through a device using the affected `wilc1000` driver.
