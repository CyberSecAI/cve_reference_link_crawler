- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `copy_bytes` function within `decode_r2007.c` due to an invalid section size. The `section->data_size` might exceed the allocated `section_page->uncomp_size`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in a crash, denial of service, or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted DWG file. Specifically, the `dwgread` program is used to open a specially crafted DWG file, which contains an invalid section size causing the `copy_bytes` function to write beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to the vulnerable application.
