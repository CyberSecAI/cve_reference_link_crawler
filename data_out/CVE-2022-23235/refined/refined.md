- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from AutoSupport telemetry data being sent by Active IQ Unified Manager even when AutoSupport is disabled. This data contains sensitive information about the cluster, nodes, and the Active IQ Unified Manager itself.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to the transmission of sensitive data in AutoSupport telemetry. The vulnerability lies in the fact that this data is sent even when AutoSupport is disabled, bypassing the user's intent to prevent telemetry data from being sent.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to discover cluster, node, and Active IQ Unified Manager specific information. This could include details that could aid in further attacks or compromise the system's confidentiality.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. The vulnerable telemetry data is sent over the network, where it can be intercepted by an attacker.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a network position where they can intercept the AutoSupport telemetry data being sent by the Active IQ Unified Manager. No authentication or user interaction is required.
