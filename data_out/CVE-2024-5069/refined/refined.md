Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-5069:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `view_service.php` file in the Men's Salon Management System v1.0 does not properly validate or filter user input data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute unauthorized SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches (accessing sensitive data).
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    - Complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `view_service.php` file, likely through user-supplied parameters in HTTP requests (e.g. GET or POST parameters) that are directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with crafted SQL injection payloads to the vulnerable `view_service.php` script. This can be done remotely if the application is exposed online. No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code is part of the "Simple Online Mens Salon Management System," available from sourcecodester.com.
- The vulnerability was submitted by a user named Wangwei.
- This information is based on a submission and therefore caution should be taken.
