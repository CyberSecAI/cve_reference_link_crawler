Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) version 1.21.2, specifically in the `k5sealv3.c` file.
- The `alloc_data` function allocates memory which is not released in certain error conditions.
- Specifically, if the if condition on line 133 evaluates to true, a goto statement will jump to the `error` label, skipping the necessary memory deallocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The allocated memory via `calloc` is not freed, leading to a resource leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated exploitation of the memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, causing the application or system to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based exploitation is implied due to the nature of Kerberos.
- An attacker could trigger the vulnerable code path by sending specially crafted requests to the Kerberos service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Kerberos service using the GSSAPI interface.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting an unauthenticated attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by crafting specific requests.
- The attacker likely needs to trigger the error condition at line 133 of k5sealv3.c to cause the leak.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in `krb5/src/lib/gssapi/krb5/k5sealv3.c` on line 135.
- The `plain` variable's allocated memory is lost if the error condition is met, leading to the leak.

**Affected NetApp Products:**
- Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
- Cloud Volumes ONTAP Mediator
- Management Services for Element Software and NetApp HCI
- NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610C
- NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610S
- NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H615C
- ONTAP 9
- ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility

**Unaffected NetApp Products:**
- A long list of NetApp products are not affected, including various BIOS, controllers, management software, and other utilities.

**Remediation:**
- Patches are available for some affected products, including ONTAP 9 and Management Services for Element Software and NetApp HCI.
- Some products are listed as "no plans to address this vulnerability."
