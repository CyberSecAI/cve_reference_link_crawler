Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input within the `edit_admin_query.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System. Specifically, the parameters `username`, `password`, `name`, and `admin_id` are vulnerable. The system fails to properly process the input data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without sanitizing or escaping special characters, allowing an attacker to modify the SQL query's structure and logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can inject SQL queries to access sensitive data without proper authorization.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Arbitrary Query Execution:** The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary queries on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious HTTP requests with crafted payloads in the `username`, `password`, `name`, or `admin_id` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the web server running the Internship Portal Management System.
*  **Knowledge of the application:** Attackers need some knowledge of the web application structure and vulnerabilities, including the vulnerable parameters of the `edit_admin_query.php` file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in `Internship Portal Management System 1.0`.
*   The vulnerable file is `edit_admin_query.php`.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in the mentioned repository on GitHub.
