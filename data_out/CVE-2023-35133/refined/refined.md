Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-35133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on the cURL blocked hosts list when evaluating the IP address 0.0.0.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The inadequate validation of the blocked hosts list allows an attacker to potentially craft requests that bypass intended restrictions, leading to SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the SSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to make requests to internal network resources or external servers that are not directly accessible, potentially leading to information disclosure, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating requests in Moodle that utilize cURL, specifically targeting the insufficient checks on blocked hosts when 0.0.0.0 is involved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send requests to the Moodle server that trigger the cURL functionality. This could be through various functionalities depending on the application's features and user access levels. The specific position and capabilities are not explicit from the provided information, but it would likely involve a user capable of making requests to the Moodle server that utilize the vulnerable cURL functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Moodle versions: 4.2, 4.1 to 4.1.3, 4.0 to 4.0.8, 3.11 to 3.11.14, 3.9 to 3.9.21 and earlier unsupported versions.
- Fixed versions are: 4.2.1, 4.1.4, 4.0.9, 3.11.15 and 3.9.22.
- The issue is tracked as MDL-78215 in the Moodle tracker.
- The vulnerability is considered a serious risk.
