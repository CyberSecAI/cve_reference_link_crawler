Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the failure to reset secret fields (request headers and authentication password) associated with a DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) site profile when the target URLs within the profile are changed. This means that even if a user modifies the target URLs, the previously configured secret data remains associated with the profile.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Handling of Secrets:** Secret data, like headers and passwords, is not cleared or reset when the associated target URLs are modified.
*   **Lack of Consistent Behavior:** Unlike other similar secret handling processes in GitLab (e.g., webhooks and integrations), DAST site profiles do not reset secrets on URL changes.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** A developer, who may not have the rights to view the secrets directly, can manipulate the profile to exfiltrate them, due to the lack of secret reset upon URL change.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Secret Leakage:** Attackers can obtain the secret request headers and authentication credentials (username and password) stored within a DAST site profile.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Leaked credentials can be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources protected by those credentials.
*   **Accidental Exposure:** If a user updates the URLs without knowing they must also reset the secret information, they might inadvertently expose sensitive data to the new URL destination.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulation of Site Profile URLs:** An attacker can modify the target URLs within an existing DAST site profile.
*   **Triggering a DAST Scan:** The attacker initiates a DAST scan using the modified profile with a target URL controlled by the attacker (a "catch site"). The scan then sends the secrets to the attacker's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Project Developer Role:** The attacker needs to be a developer within the GitLab project to have the rights to modify the DAST Site Profile.
*   **Ability to Create a Branch:** The attacker needs to be able to create a branch within the project to initiate a DAST scan.
*   **Access to "catch site":** Attacker needs a server to receive the leaked credentials and headers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to a previously reported and fixed issue related to integrations in GitLab.
*   The provided report includes a suggested fix involving the introduction of a `before_save` hook to reset secret variables when the site URL is changed.
*   The provided report also includes a detailed set of steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including setting up a "catch site" to intercept the leaked secrets.

This vulnerability allows a user to get access to secrets they would not normally have, this could potentially allow for horizontal privilege escalation in other connected systems.
