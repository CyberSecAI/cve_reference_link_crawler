- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect parsing of numbers with different radices in the IP address validation feature. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to how FortiOS and FortiProxy handle zero characters within IP addresses, which can lead to misinterpretation of the address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control due to the mishandling of zero characters in IP address parsing, which allows attackers to bypass IP blocklists. This is described as an incorrect parsing of numbers with different radices vulnerability [CWE-1389].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can bypass IP blocklists by sending crafted requests with manipulated IP addresses. This could allow unauthorized access or actions within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via crafted requests that manipulate IP addresses using zero characters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected FortiOS or FortiProxy devices and does not need to be authenticated. The attacker must craft a malicious request with an IP address formatted to bypass the blocklist.
