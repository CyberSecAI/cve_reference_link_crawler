The content is related to CVE-2024-4824.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the School ERP Pro+Responsive application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input that is used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the `/SchoolERP/office_admin/` endpoint and parameters such as `groups_id`, `examname`, `classes_id`, `es_voucherid`, `es_class`, and potentially others.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized data access and retrieval of all information stored in the database.
    - Data modification and deletion.
    - Potential compromise of the entire application and server, depending on the database user's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, where a remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious SQL code via the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit this vulnerability remotely, as the parameters are accessible to anyone who can reach the `/SchoolERP/office_admin/` endpoint.
