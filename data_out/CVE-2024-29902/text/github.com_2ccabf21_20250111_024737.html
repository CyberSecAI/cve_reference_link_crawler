# Malicious attachments can cause system-wide denial of service

Moderate

GHSA-88jx-383q-w4qc
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/sigstore/cosign
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 2.2.3

## Patched versions

2.2.4

## Description

### Summary

A remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial.

### Details

The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial.

The root cause is that Cosign reads the contents of the attachments entirely into memory on line 238 below:

[cosign/pkg/oci/remote/remote.go](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/9bc3ee309bf35d2f6e17f5d23f231a3d8bf580bc/pkg/oci/remote/remote.go#L228-L239)

Lines 228 to 239
in
[9bc3ee3](/sigstore/cosign/commit/9bc3ee309bf35d2f6e17f5d23f231a3d8bf580bc)

|  | func (f \*attached) Payload() ([]byte, error) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | // remote layers are believed to be stored |
|  | // compressed, but we don't compress attachments |
|  | // so use "Compressed" to access the raw byte |
|  | // stream. |
|  | rc, err := f.layer.Compressed() |
|  | if err != nil { |
|  | return nil, err |
|  | } |
|  | defer rc.Close() |
|  | return io.ReadAll(rc) |
|  | } |

...and prior to that, neither Cosign nor go-containerregistry checks the size of the attachment and enforces a max cap. In the case of a remote layer of `f *attached`, go-containerregistry will invoke this API:

<https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/a0658aa1d0cc7a7f1bcc4a3af9155335b6943f40/pkg/v1/remote/layer.go#L36-L40>

```
func (rl *remoteLayer) Compressed() (io.ReadCloser, error) {
	// We don't want to log binary layers -- this can break terminals.
	ctx := redact.NewContext(rl.ctx, "omitting binary blobs from logs")
	return rl.fetcher.fetchBlob(ctx, verify.SizeUnknown, rl.digest)
}
```

Notice that the second argument to `rl.fetcher.fetchBlob` is `verify.SizeUnknown` which results in not using the `io.LimitReader` in `verify.ReadCloser`:

<https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/a0658aa1d0cc7a7f1bcc4a3af9155335b6943f40/internal/verify/verify.go#L82-L100>

```
func ReadCloser(r io.ReadCloser, size int64, h v1.Hash) (io.ReadCloser, error) {
	w, err := v1.Hasher(h.Algorithm)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	r2 := io.TeeReader(r, w) // pass all writes to the hasher.
	if size != SizeUnknown {
		r2 = io.LimitReader(r2, size) // if we know the size, limit to that size.
	}
	return &and.ReadCloser{
		Reader: &verifyReader{
			inner:    r2,
			hasher:   w,
			expected: h,
			wantSize: size,
		},
		CloseFunc: r.Close,
	}, nil
}
```
### Impact

This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer.

### Remediation

Update to the latest version of Cosign, which limits the number of attachments. An environment variable can override this value.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
