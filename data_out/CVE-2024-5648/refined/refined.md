### CVE-2024-5648
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The LearnDash LMS - Reports Free plugin lacks proper authorization checks in multiple AJAX functions, allowing unauthorized users to modify plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Capability Checks:** Several AJAX functions, including `wrld_set_configuration`, `wrld_exclude_settings_save`, `apply_time_tracking_settings`, and `wp_ajax_wrld_gutenberg_block_visit` lack checks to ensure that only users with appropriate administrative capabilities can access and execute them.
*   The vulnerability allows authenticated users with subscriber-level access and above to modify settings.
*   The vulnerability resides in the `class-admin-functions.php` file

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could modify plugin settings that could lead to a variety of outcomes, such as:
    *   Changing plugin configurations (e.g., menu settings, dashboard access roles).
    *   Manipulating time tracking settings.
    *   Excluding users/roles from reports.
    *   Modifying plugin behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by making AJAX calls to the vulnerable functions.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with subscriber-level or higher access to the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target WordPress site. Subscriber-level access is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker must know which AJAX actions are vulnerable to target.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.8.2.1 of the LearnDash LMS - Reports Free plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.8.2.2 of the plugin.
