### @daffl **[daffl](/daffl)** commented [Jul 17, 2023](#issue-1808721777)

This is a fix for a security issue where the conversion of the following template string:

```
const message = `${{ toString: '' }}`
```

Triggers an error killing the NodeJS process. This error happens when e.g. sending a `socket.emit('find', { toString: '' })` message.

Sorry, something went wrong.
