{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Feathers socket handler did not properly handle invalid string conversion errors when processing Socket.io messages. Specifically, it failed to catch errors arising from objects with a `toString` property that did not return a valid string, leading to crashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-1321"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted Socket.io message, such as `socket.emit('find', { toString: '' })`, can cause the NodeJS process to crash due to an unhandled string conversion error.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted Socket.io message to the server containing an object that would cause an error when implicitly converted to a string."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send a Socket.io message to the server."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the core Socket handling code, requiring an upgrade to the patched versions to address it. The issue was resolved in version 5.0.8 and 4.5.18, with the fix preventing sockets from looking up service paths using an implicit toString method.",
