- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SINEMA Server V14 improperly sanitizes certain SNMP configuration data retrieved from monitored devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of SNMP data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform a stored XSS attack potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the application server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a monitored device can inject malicious code into SNMP configuration data, which is then not properly sanitized by the SINEMA server and is displayed, leading to code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a monitored device that can be configured with malicious SNMP data. The user browsing the SINEMA server must also be authenticated.
