A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Server V14 (All versions). The affected application improperly sanitizes certain SNMP configuration data retrieved from monitored devices. An attacker with access to a monitored device could perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack that may lead to arbitrary code execution with `SYSTEM` privileges on the application server.
