```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The web management interface of the affected Multilaser router has a flawed access control mechanism that allows unauthenticated users to bypass authentication by including an "admin:" cookie in HTTP requests.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper access control: The router's web interface does not properly validate user sessions.
- Cookie manipulation: The vulnerability can be exploited by adding an "admin:" cookie to HTTP requests, granting access to management features without authentication.

Impact of exploitation:
- Bypassing authentication: Attackers can bypass the router's web interface login and gain unauthorized access to management features.
- Full control of router: Attackers can modify settings, such as changing DNS settings, enabling remote access, modifying the IP routing table, and retrieving WiFi and management application passwords.

Attack vectors:
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via malicious applications performing HTTP requests against the router.
- Local exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited locally by connecting to a vulnerable router through a local network.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to send HTTP requests with a modified cookie to the vulnerable router.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the router, either remotely or locally.
