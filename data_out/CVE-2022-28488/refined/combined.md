| ***Describe the bug*** An unitialized variable is used in function wav\_format\_write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. The unitialized variable `format` is copied to the stream pointed by `f` variable, as illustrated below.     [libwav/libwav.c](https://github.com/marc-q/libwav/blob/5cc874635f4e5a37cc6e380c9d6feb3afa5d0b39/libwav.c#L52-L64)  Lines 52 to 64 in [5cc8746](/marc-q/libwav/commit/5cc874635f4e5a37cc6e380c9d6feb3afa5d0b39)   |  | enum wav\_error | | --- | --- | |  | wav\_format\_write (const wav\_format \*format, FILE \*f) | |  | { | |  | if (f == NULL) | |  | { | |  | return WAV\_FILE\_NOT\_OPENED; | |  | } | |  | else if (fwrite (format, sizeof (wav\_format), 1, f) != 1) | |  | { | |  | return WAV\_ERROR; | |  | } | |  | return WAV\_OK; | |  | } |      System info   * Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, clang version 12.0.1 * latest commit [5cc8746](https://github.com/marc-q/libwav/commit/5cc874635f4e5a37cc6e380c9d6feb3afa5d0b39)   **Steps to reproduce the behavior**   * compile the program with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer * Run command: `./wav_gain POC /dev/null`   ***poc***  <https://github.com/tin-z/Stuff_and_POCs/blob/main/poc_libwav/POC>  ***Output***  ``` Uninitialized bytes in __interceptor_fwrite at offset 0 inside [0x7ffed0df95e8, 16) ==273091==WARNING: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value     #0 0x2ca7dc in wav_chunk_write /dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/tools/wav_gain/../../libwav.c     #1 0x2cb559 in wav_write /dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/tools/wav_gain/../../libwav.c:217:2     #2 0x2cb559 in gain_file /dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/tools/wav_gain/wav_gain.c:28:6     #3 0x2cb559 in main /dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/tools/wav_gain/wav_gain.c:43:3     #4 0x7f6b850e10b2 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-sMfBJT/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16     #5 0x24b43d in _start (/dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/Fuzzing/wav_gain+0x24b43d)  SUMMARY: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value /dataZ/Part_2/libwav_example/libwav/tools/wav_gain/../../libwav.c in wav_chunk_write  ```  * Note, wav\_chunk\_write function calls wav\_format\_write, where it's the bug at. |
