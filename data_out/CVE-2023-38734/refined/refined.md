- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect privilege assignment when importing users from an LDAP directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how IBM Robotic Process Automation handles user privilege assignments during the import process from an LDAP directory. Specifically, the system assigns incorrect privileges to users imported from LDAP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to users having incorrect access and permissions within the system, potentially allowing them to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to do. The specific impact would depend on the misassigned privileges and the functionality within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: This vulnerability is exploited by importing a user from an LDAP directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to import users from an LDAP directory into the IBM Robotic Process Automation system. This likely requires some level of administrative access to the RPA system.
