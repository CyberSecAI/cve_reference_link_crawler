Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `admin-manage-user.php` file of the "Employee Task Management System in PHP/PDO Free Source Code". Specifically, the code takes user input from the `$_GET['admid_id']` parameter without proper sanitization or validation. This unsanitized input is then used directly in a database query, creating a SQL injection vulnerability.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query via the vulnerable `admin_id` parameter.
    - Lack of Input Validation: The code fails to validate or sanitize user input received via the `$_GET['admid_id']` parameter.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Database Access: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database.
    - Data Breach: This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Server Compromise: If the database user has DBA privileges, successful exploitation may escalate to gaining server host privileges.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    - HTTP GET Parameter: The attack vector is through the `admin_id` parameter in a GET request to `admin-manage-user.php`.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No authentication or special access is explicitly stated as needed.

* **Additional details from the content:**
    - The vulnerability is located in `admin-manage-user.php` at line 20 for input and line 24 for the vulnerable query.
   - The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) payload `/admin-manage-user.php?delete_user=1&admin_id=2%20AND%20(SELECT%206620%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(10)))mOfh)` demonstrates how to inject a time-based SQL injection.
    - The attacker can use tools like SQLmap to automate the exploitation process.
