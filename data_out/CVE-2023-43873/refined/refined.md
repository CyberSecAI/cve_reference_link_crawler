- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Name" field within the "Manage Menu" of the e107 CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the web page containing the manipulated menu item. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a crafted script into the "Name" field of a menu item via the administrative interface of the CMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to edit menu items in the e107 CMS. The attacker does not need to be a remote user; they can be a local, authenticated user of the system.
