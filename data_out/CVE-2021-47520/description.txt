In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: pch_can: pch_can_rx_normal: fix use after free

After calling netif_receive_skb(skb), dereferencing skb is unsafe.
Especially, the can_frame cf which aliases skb memory is dereferenced
just after the call netif_receive_skb(skb).

Reordering the lines solves the issue.
