### CVE-2024-24276
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Teamwire Windows client rendered user-supplied HTML code in several places without proper sanitization. Although the HTML code was sanitized by AngularJS's `sanitize$` function, preventing the insertion of malicious JavaScript code, there were still instances where the HTML was rendered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sanitization of HTML code, leading to potential HTML injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Without a bypass of the sanitization function, only harmless modifications like manipulation of the application's appearance or embedding external images was possible. A successful bypass would allow for RCE.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker could inject malicious HTML in the following places: 
   1.  When an administrator renamed a chat
   2.  In the message preview when a user answered another message
   3.  When a user with a manipulated name was removed from a group
   4.  When an administrator tried to leave a chat that still contained a group of which he was a member
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position where they can manipulate data that will be rendered in the above described contexts. This could be a malicious user or a compromised administrator.
