- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Site Reviews plugin (versions <= 6.2.0) is vulnerable to CSV Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can craft malicious formulas within a CSV file. When opened with spreadsheet software, these formulas could be executed, leading to exploitation of vulnerabilities in the software or execution of arbitrary commands on the victim's PC.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited through the crafting of malicious formulas embedded within a CSV file, likely exported from the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs the ability to inject malicious CSV content.
