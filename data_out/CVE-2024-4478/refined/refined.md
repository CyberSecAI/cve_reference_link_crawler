### Summary:
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-4478. It describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Happy Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin, specifically within the Image Stack Group widget.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'tooltip_position' attribute within the Image Stack Group widget. This allows attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Improper output escaping

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers (Contributor level or higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
  - Account hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Malicious redirects

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts via the 'tooltip\_position' attribute in the Image Stack Group widget settings.
- The injected scripts are then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with Contributor-level access or higher.
- The attacker must have the ability to create or edit pages using the Elementor page builder and the Happy Addons plugin.
