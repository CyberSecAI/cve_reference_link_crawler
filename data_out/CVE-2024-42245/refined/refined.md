The provided content describes a revert commit for a previous patch that introduced a performance regression and potential for hard lockups in the Linux kernel's scheduler. This is related to CVE-2024-42245.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a performance regression introduced by commit `b0defa7ae03e`. This commit modified the load balancing logic to ignore `env.max_loop` if all examined tasks were pinned. The intent was to improve task detachment, but it resulted in an O(n) iteration in `detach_tasks()` when a CPU had many pinned tasks.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the inefficient iteration in `detach_tasks()`. The modified logic forces a full iteration of all tasks on a CPU, if the majority are pinned. This behavior is triggered during load balancing, which is performed with the runqueue lock held, and often in a softirq context, leading to the possibility of hard lockups. The code change created a denial-of-service condition.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for hard lockups. This can lead to system unavailability. It was observed that having O(10k) threads affined to a single CPU could trigger this issue.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves creating a scenario where a large number of tasks are affined to a single CPU. Load balancing mechanisms are then triggered, leading to the inefficient iteration in `detach_tasks()`, resulting in a lockup.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create and affined a large number of threads to a single CPU. This might require specific privileges or the ability to control the CPU affinity of processes.
