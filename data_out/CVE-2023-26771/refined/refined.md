The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26771.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The TaskCafe application's profile image upload feature does not restrict the type of file that can be uploaded, allowing users to upload arbitrary files, including malicious HTML or SVG files containing JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of file type validation on profile image uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload malicious HTML or SVG files with embedded JavaScript.
- When a victim visits the URL of the malicious file (e.g., by clicking a link), the JavaScript code will execute in the context of the victim's session.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing user authentication details
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Escalation of privileges, potentially leading to account takeover if an administrator is compromised.
    - In conjunction with an improper access control vulnerability, an attacker can change the password of any user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, by uploading malicious files through the profile image upload feature.
- Requires the victim to access/open the malicious file, for example through a phishing attack or by simply navigating to the URL of the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker requires the ability to upload files.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to access the malicious file.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a specially crafted SVG or HTML file.
- A specific Javascript payload was provided as an example, which upon execution, would retrieve the user's ID and username and send this information to a server controlled by the attacker.
- This is exploitable because the application lacks proper file validation, specifically failing to check the file type or sanitize the file content during the upload process.
- The advisory also describes how this vulnerability, combined with an improper access control issue (CVE-2023-26770), can lead to an administrator account takeover.
