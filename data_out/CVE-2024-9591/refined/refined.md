- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the `_category_image` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `_category_image` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attackers with editor-level and above permissions. The vulnerability is limited to multi-site installations and installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.
