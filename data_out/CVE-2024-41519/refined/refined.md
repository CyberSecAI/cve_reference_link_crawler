Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-41519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `school` input field during the registration process. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the `school` field and then stored in the applicationâ€™s database. This injected code is then executed when a user views the registration overview.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
- **Data Theft:** This could lead to the theft of sensitive user data, such as session cookies or other personal information.
- **Malicious Activities:** Attackers could perform various malicious activities, including redirecting users to malicious sites, modifying page content, or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Field Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable `school` input field during the registration process.
- **Registration Overview:** The malicious code is executed when the registration overview is accessed, specifically at `/admin/programm/<program_id>/zuordnung/veranstaltungen/<event_id>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Register:** The attacker needs the ability to register for an event using the vulnerable form.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and understand Javascript code.
- **No Special Privilege Required:** No special administrative privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is achieved by injecting JavaScript into the `school` input field during the registration process. The injected code is executed when viewing the registration overview. The provided images in the source document clearly demonstrate this process, including the input field where the malicious script was injected and the resulting execution of the injected JavaScript code in the user's browser.
