Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-37904.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists when accepting invites, allowing more users than permitted to be created from invite links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition in the invite acceptance process.
- Concurrent requests to redeem an invite can bypass the intended limitation of the invite (e.g., single-use invites can be used multiple times).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- More users than permitted can be created via invite links.
- Single-use invite links can be used multiple times, leading to unexpected user creation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitation requires sending concurrent requests to accept an invite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs an invite link.
- The attacker must be able to send concurrent requests to the invite acceptance endpoint.
- Low privileges are required, which means they can be an unprivileged user.
- User interaction is required (by using the invite link)
