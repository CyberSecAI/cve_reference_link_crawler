The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26967.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing terminators in frequency table arrays within the `drivers/clk/qcom/camcc-sc8280xp.c` file of the Linux kernel. These arrays are expected to have an empty element at the end to signal termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The absence of the terminating empty element in the frequency table arrays can lead to out-of-bounds access when functions like `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()` traverse the tables, potentially reading beyond allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the system due to an out-of-bounds read. There is also a possibility for other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when the affected clock driver is used, and the functions `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()` are called to search the frequency tables. This could happen during normal system operation or through specific actions interacting with the clock subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger the use of the vulnerable clock driver and the execution of frequency table lookup functions. This could be done by interacting with the affected hardware or via specific software configurations that invoke these lookups.
