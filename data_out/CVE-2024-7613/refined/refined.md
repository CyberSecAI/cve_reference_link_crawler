Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `fromGstDhcpSetSer` function of the `/bin/httpd` program in Tenda FH1206 firmware.
- The function takes the `dips` parameter from a user request and copies part of it to a stack variable `v21` using `strncpy`.
- The size of the copied portion depends on the location of the last `.` in the input string.
- After the copy, the string is concatenated with a `1` and used in an `ifconfig` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stack Overflow:**
    - The `strncpy` operation can cause a stack buffer overflow because the size of the copy is determined by the position of the last `.` in the input string, which can be controlled by the attacker.
2.  **Command Injection:**
    - The lack of input validation on the `dips` parameter allows for command injection. Characters within the `dips` parameter are directly included into the `ifconfig` command without filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the stack overflow, an attacker can overwrite return addresses on the stack and redirect program execution flow, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution on the device.
- **Command Injection:** The command injection vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/GstDhcpSetSer` endpoint.
- **`dips` Parameter:** The malicious payload is contained within the `dips` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/GstDhcpSetSer` and the vulnerable `dips` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1206 V1.2.0.8(8155).
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger both stack overflow and command injection using a Python script that sends a POST request with a long string of 'a's before the `...` in the `dips` parameter.
- The `strncpy` function is used, and the size parameter is based on the position of the final ".".
- The injected command is appended to the end of the `dips` value before being passed into the `ifconfig` command.
