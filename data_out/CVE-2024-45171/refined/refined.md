Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45171

**Root Cause:** Improper user input validation in the C-MOR Video Surveillance web interface's backup file upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The system allows uploading files with dangerous types, such as PHP code, without proper validation of the file content or type.
*   **Insufficient File Name Validation:** The only validation is that the file name contains the string ".cbkf".
*   **Broken Access Control:** Low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality (as described in SYSS-2024-024).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a PHP web shell to the server and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise of the C-MOR video surveillance system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the C-MOR web interface's backup file upload feature.
*   **Network Access:** The web interface is accessible via the network and the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a low-privileged one).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the C-MOR system's web interface.

**Technical Details:**
*   The upload functionality for backup files allows the upload of arbitrary files if the filename contains ".cbkf"
*   Uploaded files are stored in the `/srv/www/backups` directory on the C-MOR system.
*   The uploaded files can be accessed via the URL `https://<HOST>/backup/upload_<FILENAME>`.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) uses a simple PHP web shell for command execution.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to C-MOR Video Surveillance version 6.00PL1.
