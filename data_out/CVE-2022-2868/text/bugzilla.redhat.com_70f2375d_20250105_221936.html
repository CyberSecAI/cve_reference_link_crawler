| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2118863#c0)  Todd Cullum    2022-08-16 23:47:56 UTC  ``` In libtiff's tiffcrop utility (tools/tiffcrop.c), a crafted file could supply an invalid crop_width and/or crop_length, and since these values were computed prior to the sanity check, invalid values could later cause out-of-bounds reads in reverseSamples16bits().
