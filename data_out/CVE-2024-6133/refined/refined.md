- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`eStore_customer_search`) before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The vulnerability could be exploited against high-privilege users like administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML file that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, will automatically submit a form to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted payload in the `eStore_customer_search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML file.
