Note that the reproducer doesn't work out of the box on a modern kernel, as the ioctl TIOCSTI is disabled by default nowadays.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thank you for the report!  This is clearly a security issue with a published PoC that has not been addressed for 5 months, so I am going to merge this directly and notify the upstream issue after the fact.  Could you also add a note that many modern Linux distributions disable that IOCTL, and a way to test if your system is vulnerable? That would make the advisory more actionable.  I believe simply running `sysctl dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti` should show it, and if set to `1` it would be exploitable. Could you confirm that this command outputs 0 on the systems that are not affected? |

| I added a section on how to check if TIOCSTI is disabled, but I don't know if that also affects TIOCLINUX (and the poc doesn't use that, so hard to test without building a new poc) |

| Ah, good point about `TIOCLINUX`!  If the steps only cover part of the attack surface, it is best to leave them out. No reason to give a false sense of security when `TIOCSTI` is disabled but `TIOCLINUX` is not. |
