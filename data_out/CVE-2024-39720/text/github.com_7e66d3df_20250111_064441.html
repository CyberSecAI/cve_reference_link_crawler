    …

   ```
   If we try to use mmap when the model is larger than the system free space, loading is slower than the no-mmap approach.

1. [cmd: defer stating model info until necessary (](/ollama/ollama/commit/2aa91a937ba199ae5832c71ecc10221cc6420fa8)[#5248](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/5248)[)](/ollama/ollama/commit/2aa91a937ba199ae5832c71ecc10221cc6420fa8)
    …

   ```
   This commit changes the 'ollama run' command to defer fetching model
   information until it really needs it. That is, when in interactive mode.

   It also removes one such case where the model information is fetch in
   duplicate, just before calling generateInteractive and then again, first
   thing, in generateInteractive.

   This positively impacts the performance of the command:

2. [llm: speed up gguf decoding by a lot (](/ollama/ollama/commit/cb42e607c5cf4d439ad4d5a93ed13c7d6a09fc34)[#5246](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/5246)[)](/ollama/ollama/commit/cb42e607c5cf4d439ad4d5a93ed13c7d6a09fc34)
    …

   ```
   Previously, some costly things were causing the loading of GGUF files
   and their metadata and tensor information to be VERY slow:

     * Too many allocations when decoding strings
     * Hitting disk for each read of each key and value, resulting in a
       not-okay amount of syscalls/disk I/O.

   The show API is now down to 33ms from 800ms+ for llama3 on a macbook pro
   m3.

   This commit also prevents collecting large arrays of values when
   decoding GGUFs (if desired). When such keys are encountered, their
   values are null, and are encoded as such in JSON.

   Also, this fixes a broken test that was not encoding valid GGUF.
   ```
