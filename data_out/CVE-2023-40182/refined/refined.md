{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The recovery form in recovery.php exhibits a timing discrepancy. The server responds in a noticeably different amount of time depending on whether the provided email address exists in the database or not.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Timing side-channel vulnerability (CWE-208). The difference in response time allows an attacker to infer whether an email address exists in the system.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can enumerate valid email addresses within the system by observing the response time of the recovery form.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests to the recovery form.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the recovery form and measure the time it takes for the server to respond. No special privileges are required."
