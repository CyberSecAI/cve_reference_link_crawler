{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application starts a session using `session_start()` but fails to regenerate the session ID after a successful login. This allows an attacker to potentially fixate a session ID onto a victim.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Session Fixation Vulnerability",
	  "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can hijack a user's session, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application by controlling the session ID.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload via the `book-boat.php` form which uses `document.cookie` to get cookies.",
       "The admin user accessing the `all-booking.php` page triggers the stored XSS which sends the admin's cookie to the attacker",
        "Attacker uses the stolen cookie to login as admin"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject a script into the `book-boat.php` form and have a listener set up to capture the admin cookie. This can be achieved through XSS vulnerability."
