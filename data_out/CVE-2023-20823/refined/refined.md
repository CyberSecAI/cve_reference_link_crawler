- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an incorrect status check within the `cmdq` component, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically an incorrect status check resulting in an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to a local denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs system execution privileges. User interaction is not required.
