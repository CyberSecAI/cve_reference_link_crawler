The provided content relates to CVE-2023-46980.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect access control in the "Update User Form" of the Best Courier Management System v.1.000. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `userID` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect Access Control
- Arbitrary code execution via a crafted script in the `userID` parameter.
- Privilege escalation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges, potentially leading to full account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious script to the `userID` parameter within the "Update User Form". The `userID` can be obtained through password reset functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality to get user IDs and the update user functionality to inject the malicious script, making this a remote vulnerability.
