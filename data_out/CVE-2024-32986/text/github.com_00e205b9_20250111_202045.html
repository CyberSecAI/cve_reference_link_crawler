## Important

This release contains a critical security fix for a vulnerability that could **compromise your system**. The vulnerability affects users of Linux and PortableApps.com integrations of all previous versions.

All Linux and PortableApps.com users are advised to update to this version **as soon as possible**. It is also recommended for Windows and macOS users to update to this version, as it contains additional related fixes. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes.

The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2024-32986](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32986) and [GHSA-jmhv-m7v5-g5jq](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/security/advisories/GHSA-jmhv-m7v5-g5jq). More details are available [on the GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/security/advisories/GHSA-jmhv-m7v5-g5jq).

## Added

* **Initial support for linking runtime ([#403](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/pull/403), thanks to [@tiziodcaio](https://github.com/tiziodcaio)):**

  This introduces initial support for linking the globally installed Firefox version with symlinks for usage as PWAsForFirefox runtime. This feature is experimental and currently only supports Linux with Firefox installed to `/usr/lib/firefox`. It is disabled by default, to use it, you need to manually compile the native program with the `link-runtime` feature, then run `firefoxpwa runtime install --link` to link the runtime.

## Changed

* Improved various messages ([#491](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/pull/491), thanks to [@kra-mo](https://github.com/kra-mo)).
* Improved NixOS installation instructions in the extension.
* Improved a list of websites with problems in the documentation.
* Imported new translations from Crowdin (Slovenian, French, Indonesian).
* Updated dependencies.

## Fixed

* Fixed launching web apps without `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK` permission ([#460](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/issues/460)).
* Fixed improper sanitization of web app properties that lead to critical security vulnerability.
* Prevented changing tab background when the theme color is disabled.
