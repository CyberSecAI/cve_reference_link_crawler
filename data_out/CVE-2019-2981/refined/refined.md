Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-2981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an "Unexpected exception thrown by XPath processing crafted XPath expression" within the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) component of OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or handling of crafted XPath expressions during processing. This leads to an unexpected exception being thrown.
