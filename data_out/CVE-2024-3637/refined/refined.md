{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "High privilege users, like admin, can perform stored XSS attacks, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'Field Name' input within the plugin's form builder.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have high privileges, such as admin access, to modify the plugin's settings."
