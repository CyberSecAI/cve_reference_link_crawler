- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Syslog traffic was transmitted in cleartext in Brocade SANnav versions prior to v2.3.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is the lack of encryption for syslog traffic. This allows for eavesdropping and capture of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could capture sensitive information by intercepting the cleartext syslog traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through network traffic interception.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic to capture the syslog messages. No authentication is required.
