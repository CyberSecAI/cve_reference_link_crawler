| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | **BSA-2024-2575** |
| --- | --- |
| **Components** | **syslog** |
|  |  |

**Summary**

In Brocade SANnav, before Brocade SANnav v2.3.0, syslog traffic was received in clear text. This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to capture sensitive information.

**Products Affected**

* Brocade SANNav before v2.3.0

**Solution**

A security update is provided in Brocade SANnav v2.3.0.

**Notes**

* Brocade SANnav 2.3.0 and above uses secure syslog by default.
* Brocade Fabric OS (FOS) v9.2.0 and above ensures secure Syslog by default.
* Prior versions of Brocade Fabric OS can be configured to enable secure syslog, but it is not enabled by default.
* Brocade SANnav and Brocade Fabric OS must run versions supporting secure syslog. Otherwise, Brocade SANnav is registered in insecure mode.

* Pierre Bare later reported the issue to Brocade
