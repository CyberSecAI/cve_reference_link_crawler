- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unprivileged users can perform actions that should require higher privileges. Specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploiting the lack of proper authorization checks in a vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber to the WordPress site, suggesting that a logged in user with minimal privileges can exploit the vulnerability.
