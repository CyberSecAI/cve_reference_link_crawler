The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48860.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing `of_node_put()` call in the `xemaclite_of_probe` function of the Linux kernel driver for Xilinx Ethernet MAC Lite. The function `of_parse_phandle()` increments the refcount of a node pointer, and if the network device registration fails, the pointer is not released, leading to a refcount leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A resource (memory) leak vulnerability is present due to the missing `of_node_put()` call when an error occurs during network device registration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion and potentially a denial-of-service condition if the function is called repeatedly.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered when the probe function `xemaclite_of_probe` is called (typically during device initialization) and the network device registration fails, leading to the resource leak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to trigger the network device registration to fail, this is likely a local attacker with control over the device tree configuration.
