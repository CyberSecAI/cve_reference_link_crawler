- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly neutralize user-controllable input in the `category_name` parameter before displaying it in the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically related to the `category_name` parameter in `category.php`. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which relates to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a compromise of data integrity, where malicious scripts are executed in the victim's browser and potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is remote and requires user interaction. The attacker injects malicious script via the `category_name` parameter. When a user views the page, the injected script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `category_name` parameter in the `category.php` file of the application. The attacker doesn't require any special access or privileges to carry out the attack.
