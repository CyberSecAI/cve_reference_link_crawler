Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-25626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper authentication checks on specific pages of the Identity Manager's management console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: An unauthenticated user can access specific URLs within the Identity Manager's management console.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Although an unauthenticated user can access certain pages, the system prevents the user from performing server-side tasks without a valid web session. This suggests the impact is limited to potentially viewing restricted management console pages. However, the specific data exposed by these pages is not detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely. The attack complexity is low (AC:L). The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N). There is no user interaction required (UI:N), scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U). The confidentiality, integrity and availability is affected with low, low and high respectively.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to access the vulnerable pages, meaning they can exploit this vulnerability without any prior access to the system.
