Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `_assign()` method of the `mini-deep-assign` library, specifically in `/lib/index.js:91`. This method is used for recursively copying properties from a source object to a destination object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `_assign()` method doesn't properly sanitize or validate input properties during the deep assignment process. This allows an attacker to inject malicious properties like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` into the source object. These special properties can then be used to modify the `Object.prototype`, leading to prototype pollution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can modify or overwrite existing properties, potentially disrupting the application's functionality leading to DoS.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, if the polluted properties are later used in a way that allows code execution (e.g., as part of a function call), the attacker could achieve RCE.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application logic uses the polluted prototype properties to render content, it could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can inject a malicious JSON object containing `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties. When this object is passed as a source object to the vulnerable `_assign()` method, the prototype pollution occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control the input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the source object that is passed into the vulnerable `mini-deep-assign` library's function.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable code:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the `mini-deep-assign` library and how it handles user-supplied data.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to pollute the `Object.prototype` using the `__proto__` property.
*   The document also suggests sanitizing and validating user-supplied inputs by blocking inputs containing `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` as a prevention mechanism.
*   The issue is specifically highlighted in the context of `mini-deep-assign` version 0.0.8.

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**
The document provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description, outlining the specific location of the vulnerability, its mechanism, and the potential attack vectors and impacts. It's a typical prototype pollution scenario affecting a deep assign function.
