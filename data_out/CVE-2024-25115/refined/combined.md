# Heap buffer overflow in CF.LOADCHUNK command

High

[YaacovHazan](/YaacovHazan)
published
GHSA-w583-p2wh-4vj5
Apr 9, 2024

## Package

RedisBloom

## Affected versions

<= 2.4.6, <= 2.6.9

## Patched versions

2.4.7, 2.6.10

## Description

### Impact

Specially crafted CF.LOADCHUNK commands may be used by authenticated users to perform heap overflow, which may lead to remote code execution.

The problem exists since RedisBloom 2.0.0.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in RedisBloom 2.4.7 and 2.6.10.

### Severity

High

7.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
