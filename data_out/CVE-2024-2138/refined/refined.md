- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Animated Box widget of the JetWidgets For Elementor plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the Animated Box widget within the JetWidgets For Elementor plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject the malicious scripts.
