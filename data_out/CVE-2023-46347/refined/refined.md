- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `NdkSpack::getPacks()` method in the "Step by Step products Pack" module for PrestaShop contains SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `$query` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Obtaining admin access
    - Removing or modifying data
    - Exposing sensitive data (e.g., tokens, admin ajax scripts)
    - Hijacking emails by rewriting SMTP settings
    - Deploying a webskimmer to steal credit card information
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by sending a malicious HTTP request to `modules/ndk_steppingpack/search-result.php` with a crafted `search_query` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required. The attacker can be a guest user and doesn't need any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable web application.
