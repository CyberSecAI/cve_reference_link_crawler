# Potentially untrusted input is rendered as HTML in final output

High

[FelixSchwarz](/FelixSchwarz)
published
GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229
Feb 22, 2024

## Package

pip

mjml-python
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

0.10.0

## Patched versions

0.11.0

## Description

### Impact

All users of mjml-python who insert untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered as `<script>` in the final HTML output.

The attacker must be able to control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is then send out as email to other users. The attacker could control contents of email messages sent through the platform.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not affected by this security issue which was added as part of commit [84c495d](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa).

### Workarounds

* Ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which could be rendered as HTML.

### References

* Initial issue report by [@sh-at-cs](https://github.com/sh-at-cs) in [#52](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/issues/52)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-26151

| Consider:  ``` from mjml import mjml_to_html  result = mjml_to_html(""" <mjml>   <mj-body>     <mj-text>       Pretty unsafe: &lt;script&gt;     </mj-text>   </mj-body> </mjml>""")  print(result["html"]) ```  In the resulting HTML output, the formerly HTML-escaped `<` (`&lt;`) and `>` (`&gt`) are "un-escaped", so the rendered HTML actually contains `Pretty unsafe: <script>`.  Why does this happen? This *reverses* the user's safety measures and can be dangerous.  The MJML reference implementation doesn't do this and correctly keeps such escape sequences untouched: <https://mjml.io/try-it-live/fvvhZhdu9V> |

| I tracked it down to the changes made in [84c495d](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa) ([#45](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/pull/45)), where the `formatter` argument to BeautifulSoup's `decode_contents` was explicitly set to `None`. If it is set to `"minimal"` instead (the default and prior value), HTML escape sequences are left as they are.  But it seems like (part of) the whole point of [#45](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/pull/45) was to **not** leave HTML entities as they are so as to fix [#44](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/issues/44)...

| Ah I could've sworn I tested and accounted for this scenario, but clearly I missed the mark. I think the better approach then might be to limit the scope to `mjStyle` rather than all HTML. |

| [@caseyjhol](https://github.com/caseyjhol) Thanks for the quick response! You're right, you did add an example of a very similar situation:   [mjml-python/tests/testdata/css-inlining.mjml](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/blob/713d0aad96837d12f83627736eaa35e18ff3b9ec/tests/testdata/css-inlining.mjml#L22)  Line 22 in [713d0aa](/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/713d0aad96837d12f83627736eaa35e18ff3b9ec)   |  | &lt; Hello World &gt; | | --- | --- |      [mjml-python/tests/testdata/css-inlining-expected.html](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/blob/713d0aad96837d12f83627736eaa35e18ff3b9ec/tests/testdata/css-inlining-expected.html#L127)  Line 127 in [713d0aa](/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/713d0aad96837d12f83627736eaa35e18ff3b9ec)   |  | <div style="font-family:helvetica;font-size:20px;line-height:1;text-align:left;color:#F45E43;"><span style="border: 3px solid blue;"> &lt; Hello World &gt; </span></div> | | --- | --- |      But as it turns out, the entities are in fact "un-escaped" during rendering of the test MJML file as described in this issue - the reason the test passes anyway is that the space between `&lt;` and `Hello` makes HTMLCompare consider them equal to `< Hello` (the rendered output). Minimal example:  ``` # no exception: htmlcompare.assert_same_html("&lt; script &gt;", "< script >") # exception: htmlcompare.assert_same_html("&lt;script &gt;", "<script >") ```  I haven't checked HTMLCompare's code, but I think this is probably because putting a space between `<` and the tag name [makes it stop being an HTML tag](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3314572/21564193), so the `<` is in fact equivalent to `&lt;` in this context.  But that is exactly the case that people *don't* need to guard against with sanitization/escaping. So the fix for this issue should add another test case (or extend this one) with an escaped HTML tag like `&lt;script&gt;`. |

| [@sh-at-cs](https://github.com/sh-at-cs) Thank you for reporting this issue, including the detailed analysis. I think this is a serious issue which we need to fix. I'll try to spend some time on this later - either on reviewing a solution or trying to fix this myself. When we merged [#45](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/pull/45) somehow the security implications completely escaped my attention. |

| Unfortunately all could do yesterday was to add the test case in a new branch [fix-escaped-html-tags](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/compare/fix-escaped-html-tags).  How should we fix this issue? I see two approaches (just brainstorming here):   * contents of `<mj-style>` should be kept as-is * possibly parse the contents using [tinycss2](https://github.com/Kozea/tinycss2) to ensure this is really just CSS   Would that solve the issue if we also remove the `formatter=None`? As far as I could see, `css_inline` will keep the escaped sequences (as it should). |

| I pushed some additional code in the branch [fix-escaped-html-tags](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/compare/fix-escaped-html-tags). Basically the idea is to do the unescape only for contents of `<mj-style>`.  I also added CSS parsing using tinycss2. My idea is that this would blow up if the contents would be invalid (e.g. other HTML code) but I did not test that. Not sure if it is worth the additional dependency because arbitrary CSS can influence the displayed contents...  Update: It seems like tinycss happily parses even completely invalid HTML but I think css\_inline would remove that. Should we just assume that the `<mj-style>` does not contain untrusted user input? (and maybe add a section to the readme?) |

[v0.11.0](/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/tree/v0.11.0)

[`98810f5`](/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/98810f5372ee3e852d8e6bccc59e8108150ba9d4)

This is a release which fixes an important **security issue** without additional features.

All users of 0.10.0 are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you are using mjml-python 0.9.1 or earlier, you are not affected.

Learn more in our security advisory: [Potentially untrusted input is rendered as HTML in final output (GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229)](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/security/advisories/GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229) ([CVE-2024-26151](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229 "CVE-2024-26151")). Credits go to [@sh-at-cs](https://github.com/sh-at-cs) for discovering the issue.

Other than that, only a few internal changes like the replacement of the homegrown `AttrDict` with [DotMap](https://github.com/drgrib/dotmap/) as well as switching the tests to use the well-known pytest.
