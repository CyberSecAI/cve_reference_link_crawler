# Potentially untrusted input is rendered as HTML in final output

High

[FelixSchwarz](/FelixSchwarz)
published
GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229
Feb 22, 2024

## Package

pip

mjml-python
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

0.10.0

## Patched versions

0.11.0

## Description

### Impact

All users of mjml-python who insert untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered as `<script>` in the final HTML output.

The attacker must be able to control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is then send out as email to other users. The attacker could control contents of email messages sent through the platform.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not affected by this security issue which was added as part of commit [84c495d](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa).

### Workarounds

* Ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which could be rendered as HTML.

### References

* Initial issue report by [@sh-at-cs](https://github.com/sh-at-cs) in [#52](https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/issues/52)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L
