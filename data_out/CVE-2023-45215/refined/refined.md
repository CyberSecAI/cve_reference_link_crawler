- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the lack of input validation when copying the `repeaterSSID<wlan_id>` parameter into the `tmpStr` buffer in the `setRepeaterSsid` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `setRepeaterSsid` function copies the `str_ssid` parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the length of `str_ssid`, leading to a buffer overflow if `str_ssid` is too large.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory, including return addresses, allowing them to control the execution flow of the program and achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a series of specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/boafrm/formWlanSetup` API of the `boa` web server with an overly long `repeaterSSID<wlan_id>` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device, and needs valid admin credentials to access the vulnerable API. The attacker must first load a specific HTML page `wlbasic.htm` to bypass CSRF protection before sending the malicious request.
