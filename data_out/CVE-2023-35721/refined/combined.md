### Best Practices for Updating Firmware

We recommend that you keep your NETGEAR devices up to date with the latest firmware. Firmware updates contain security fixes, bug fixes, and new features for your NETGEAR products.

If your product is supported by one of our apps, using the app is the easiest way to update your firmware:

* Orbi products: NETGEAR Orbi app

* Some NETGEAR Business products: NETGEAR Insight app (firmware updates through the app are available only for Insight subscribers)

If your product is not supported by one of our apps, you can always update your firmware manually by following the instructions in your product's user manual, firmware release notes, or product support page. For more information, see [Where can I find information about my NETGEAR product?](https://kb.netgear.com/000060613/).
