# Error page lacks escaping, leading to potential XSS on import of malicious project

Moderate

[wetneb](/wetneb)
published
GHSA-j8hp-f2mj-586g
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

maven

org.openrefine:openrefine
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<3.8.3

## Patched versions

3.8.3

## Description

### Summary

The built-in "Something went wrong!" error page includes the exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced message.

It appears that the only way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim to import a malicious file, as in [GHSA-m88m-crr9-jvqq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m88m-crr9-jvqq "GHSA-m88m-crr9-jvqq"), which may be difficult. However, out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`.

### Details

The `Command.respondWithErrorPage` (through `HttpUtilities.respondWithErrorPage`) function renders the Velocity template `error.vt`, which contains the `$message` and `$stack` variables, which are included in the response as-is:

<https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/main/webapp/modules/core/error.vt#L52-L53>

However, the message can contain HTML tags, which would then be interpreted by the browser. A mitigation would be to escape both the message and stack trace, perhaps using Guava's HTML escaper.

Flows that report errors as `application/json` responses are not interpreted by the browser and so not affected by this issue.

### PoC

In OpenRefine, use the "Import project" feature to import the following URL (or upload it as a file): <https://wandernauta.nl/oa/example.tar.gz>

A JavaScript alert appears.

### Impact

Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, provided the victim can be convinced to import a malicious project. The script can do anything the user can do.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
