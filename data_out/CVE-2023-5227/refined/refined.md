The provided content relates to a commit in the phpMyFAQ project that addresses a vulnerability related to image uploads.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of uploaded image files. Prior to this commit, the application relied solely on `getimagesize()` to check if a file was a valid image. However, this check can be bypassed by crafting files that have valid image headers but contain malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate MIME Type validation:** The original code only used `getimagesize()` which can be fooled. The commit adds a check for valid MIME types (image/jpeg, image/gif, image/png) to ensure the file is actually an image.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could upload a file disguised as an image (valid headers), but containing malicious PHP code or other exploits. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File upload:** The attacker would use the application's image upload feature to upload a specially crafted malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to upload files to the phpMyFAQ application.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a file that passes the initial `getimagesize()` check, but contains malicious code.

**Additional details:**
The commit adds a new function `isValidMimeType()` which uses `mime_content_type()` to check against a list of allowed image MIME types. This is a more secure approach to validating image uploads than solely relying on `getimagesize()`.
The code diff shows the following changes:
- Introduction of a new function `isValidMimeType` to validate MIME types.
- Use of `isValidMimeType` in the `upload` function to prevent upload of non-image files.
- Removal of redundant `getimagesize` call
