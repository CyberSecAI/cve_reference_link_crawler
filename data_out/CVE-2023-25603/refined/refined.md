- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy with untrusted domains.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-942), allowing requests from arbitrary origins.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information by sending crafted web requests.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted web requests from an unauthorized domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable FortiADC/FortiDDoS-F API. User interaction is required since the attack requires a victim to visit a malicious website.
