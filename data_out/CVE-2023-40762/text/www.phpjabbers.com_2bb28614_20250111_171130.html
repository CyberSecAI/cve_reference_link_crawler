## Testimonials

Let our clients share their experience with our donation widget and how the fundraising campaign script has improved their online business.

“

I use Freeway (software) for web design, and learned of PHPJabbers on one of their forums where they received applause as offering easy to implement and well-supported PHP scripts. I totally agree.

Robert Hicks

“

I have purchased almost all content management scripts from phpjabbers.com now and they have all worked excellently. The tiny issues that I had were resolved really quickly and hassle free. Best value for your dollar for sure!

Suzanne Wemp

“

I recently purchased a script from you guys at PHPJabbers. I'm writing now to tell you that my buying experience has exceeded anything I thought possible. I bought the PHP donation script and built a donations site for my brother and future sister in law. The site is a registry page for activities on their honeymoon.

I had 2 issues that I could not resolve and the support folks at PHPJabbers took care of it very quickly! For a cheap script, I really did not expect any support, I was dead wrong! The support was awesome and they even helped me fix an issue with my server and had nothing to do with them.

Two thumbs up from me, I'll be a customer for life!
