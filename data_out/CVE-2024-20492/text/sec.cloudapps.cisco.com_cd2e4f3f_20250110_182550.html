To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have *Administrator*-level credentials with *read-write* privileges on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain *root* privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device.  **Note:** Cisco Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
