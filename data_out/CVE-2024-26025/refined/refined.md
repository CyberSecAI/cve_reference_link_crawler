Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-26025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect default permissions for certain Intel Advisor software components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper configuration of default permissions within the software. This allows a local user to potentially exploit these permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege: An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges than initially authorized.
- Full Compromise: The CVSS scores indicate high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, potentially leading to a full system compromise if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability is exploitable through local access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the machine.
- User Interaction Required: It is marked as "User Interaction Required" in CVSS 4.0, implying some user action is required for exploitation. This is contradicted by the CVSS 3.1 and 4.0 vectors, however, which mark it as low user interaction

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected software includes Intel Advisor software and Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit before version 2024.1.
- Intel recommends updating to version 2024.1 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by ycdxsb.
- CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 vectors and scores are provided, showing a medium severity rating.
