Rather than deriving the user from the URL, can we derive it from `request.user` ? That way we're restricted to just the logged in user and limits the chance of cross user queries.

ok I tried doing that but it doesn't work due to some hybrid cloud stuff, where request.user is a lazy rpc thingy

# Improper authorization on deletion of user issue alert notifications

Moderate

[geoffg-sentry](/geoffg-sentry)
published
GHSA-54m3-95j9-v89j
Sep 17, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=23.9.0, <= 24.8.0

## Patched versions

24.9.0

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user may delete user issue alert notifications for arbitrary users given a known alert ID.

### Patches

A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to delete user alert notifications.

Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
