- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of the `path_a` parameter in `www/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php` which allows it to be passed unsanitized to the `file()` function within `classes/compareClass.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to lack of validation of the `path_a` parameter in `configcompare.crud.php`. The `file()` function in `classes/compareClass.php` is used on the user controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    - The attacker can cause the server to make arbitrary requests to internal or external URLs.
    - Arbitrary file reads can be performed by using the `file://` protocol.
    - Internal web services can be probed.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with the `path_a` parameter in a request to `www/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
