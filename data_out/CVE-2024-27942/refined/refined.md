- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected systems lack proper authentication for a critical function, allowing unauthenticated clients to disconnect any active user from the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for a critical function (CWE-306).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by preventing users from performing actions in the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication and can be in any network position.
