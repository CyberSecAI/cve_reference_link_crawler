- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unverified password change vulnerability exists within the device configuration backup process of FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness lies in the insufficient verification during password changes initiated through device configuration backups. This allows modification of super-admin passwords. The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A read-write user can exploit this vulnerability to modify super-admin passwords, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: A read-write user needs to be able to modify device configuration backups to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires read-write access to the device and needs to be able to manipulate the configuration backup process.
