- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that are normally restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a missing access control check, allowing a subscriber role user to potentially access or modify data they should not have access to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user account with the role of "Subscriber" on the affected WordPress site.
