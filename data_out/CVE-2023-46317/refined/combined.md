## Admin message

GitLab now enforces expiry dates on tokens that originally had no set expiration date. Those tokens were given an expiration date of one year later. Please review your personal access tokens, project access tokens, and group access tokens to ensure you are aware of upcoming expirations. Administrators of GitLab can find more information on how to identify and mitigate interruption in our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#troubleshooting).

# Knot Resolver 5.7.0 released

Tuesday, August 22, 2023

## Security

* avoid excessive TCP reconnections in a few more cases Like before, the remote server had to behave nonsensically in order to inflict this upon itself, but it might be abusable for DoS.

  We thank Ivan Jedek from OryxLabs for reporting this.

## Improvements

* forwarding mode: tweak dealing with failures from forwarders, in particular prefer sending CD=0 upstream (!1392)

## Bugfixes

* fix unusual timestamp format in debug dumps of records (!1386)
* adjust linker options; it should help less common platforms (!1384)
* hints module: fix names inside home.arpa. (!1406)
* EDNS padding (RFC 8467) compatibility with knot-dns 3.3 libs (!1422)
