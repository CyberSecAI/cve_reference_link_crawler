| Using the API `/api/common/ping` it's possible to achieve remote command execution on the host machine. This leads to complete control over the machine hosting the server.  To reproduce the vulnerability:   * Download the repo * Execute `node index.js` * Login * Execute this request as shown below:   [Screenshot from 2022-09-21 21-42-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35783570/191713610-6495ec14-afde-463b-80bb-41f0cf840b74.png)  HTTP request:  ``` POST /api/common/ping HTTP/1.1 Host: 0.0.0.0:8000 User-Agent: bla-bla-bla Cookie: your-auth-cookie Content-Length: 15  host=1.1.1.1;id  ```  This is the vulnerable code:  ``` 	schema.addWorkflow('ping', function($) { 		var host = $.model.host.replace(/'|"|\n/g, ''); 		Exec('ping -c 3 {0}'.format(host), $.done(true)); 	}); ```  Here the problem is the fact that the server doesn't sanitize correctly the input checking that the host provided is a legitimate one, allowing also characters like `;`, `|` or `&`. |

| With the code you can edit everything or you can run bash scripts directly. But I agree, this must be sanitised. I'll fix it. |

| Awesome. Someone could disable functionalities, but that api isn't intended to provide rce.  Thanks [@petersirka](https://github.com/petersirka) |

| if that field should accept only IPs, why not using a specific regex only for IPs?  The domain name and IP address can be pinged. It is therefore impossible to have an IP validator alone. |

| Got it. In general an allow-list is preferred over a block-list of entries. In this case the regex must check that only the allowed characters are entered: alphabetic characters (A-Z), numeric characters (0-9), the minus sign (-), and the period (.) |
