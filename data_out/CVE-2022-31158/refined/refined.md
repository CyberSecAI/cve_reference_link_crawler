- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `nonce` claim value was not being validated against the `nonce` value sent in the authentication request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of the nonce value in the authentication request. This is related to CWE-327, which indicates the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the authentication request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to intercept or influence the authentication request to exploit the vulnerability.
