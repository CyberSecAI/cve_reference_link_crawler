We have just released Go versions 1.17.5 and 1.16.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include two security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: limit growth of header canonicalization cache

  An attacker can cause unbounded memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests.

> For users who cannot immediately update to the new release, setting the GODEBUG=http2server=0 environment variable before calling Serve will disable HTTP/2 unless it was manually configured through the [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) package.

> This issue is also fixed in [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63, for users manually configuring HTTP/2.

> Thank you to murakmii for reporting this issue.

> This is CVE-2021-44716 and Go issue [go.dev/issue/50058](http://go.dev/issue/50058).

* syscall: don’t close fd 0 on ForkExec error

  When a Go program running on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and calls syscall.ForkExec (including indirectly by using the os/exec package), syscall.ForkExec can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens (or can be provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as writing network traffic intended for one connection to a different connection, or content intended for one file to a different one.

  For users who cannot immediately update to the new release, the bug can be mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit.

  Thank you to Tomasz Maczukin and Kamil Trzciński of GitLab for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2021-44717 and Go issue [go.dev/issue/50057](http://go.dev/issue/50057).

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://golang.org/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.17.5" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Alex and Filippo for the Go team
