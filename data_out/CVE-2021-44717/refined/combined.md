# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.9 or later should ensure that packages with Go binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @golang-rebuild

```

# [security] Go 1.17.5 and Go 1.16.12 are released

We have just released Go versions 1.17.5 and 1.16.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include two security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: limit growth of header canonicalization cache

  An attacker can cause unbounded memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests.

> For users who cannot immediately update to the new release, setting the GODEBUG=http2server=0 environment variable before calling Serve will disable HTTP/2 unless it was manually configured through the [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) package.

> This issue is also fixed in [golang.org/x/net/http2](http://golang.org/x/net/http2) v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63, for users manually configuring HTTP/2.

> Thank you to murakmii for reporting this issue.

> This is CVE-2021-44716 and Go issue [go.dev/issue/50058](http://go.dev/issue/50058).

* syscall: don’t close fd 0 on ForkExec error

  When a Go program running on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and calls syscall.ForkExec (including indirectly by using the os/exec package), syscall.ForkExec can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens (or can be provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as writing network traffic intended for one connection to a different connection, or content intended for one file to a different one.

  For users who cannot immediately update to the new release, the bug can be mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit.

  Thank you to Tomasz Maczukin and Kamil Trzciński of GitLab for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2021-44717 and Go issue [go.dev/issue/50057](http://go.dev/issue/50057).

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.17.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://golang.org/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.17.5" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Alex and Filippo for the Go team

Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), invalid
cryptographic computation, information leak, or arbitrary code
execution on the developer's computer in specific situations.

CVE-2020-28367

    Code injection in the go command with cgo allows arbitrary code
    execution at build time via malicious gcc flags specified via a
    #cgo directive.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-38297

    Go has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function
    invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.

CVE-2021-39293

    This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-33196.

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) Accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23806

    Curve.IsOnCurve in crypto/elliptic can incorrectly return true in
    situations with a big.Int value that is not a valid field element.

CVE-2022-24921

    regexp.Compile allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested
    expression.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.11.6-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.11 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.11 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.11>

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Brownﬁeld Connectivity – Gateway collects data from the conﬁgured clients and forwards the data to
other connected systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

                 CVE-2021-44716 CVE-2021-44717
Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) and
information leak.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-39293

    Follow-up fix to CVE-2021-33196

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.4-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.7 packages.
