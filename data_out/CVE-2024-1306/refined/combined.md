## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Smart Forms < 2.6.94 - Edit Entries via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged-in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks, such as editing entries, and we consider it a medium risk.

### Proof of Concept
