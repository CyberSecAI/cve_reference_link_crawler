A successful exploit could cause system instability if important system files are overwritten.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input for the file path in a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a targeted device and issuing a specific CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials on the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
