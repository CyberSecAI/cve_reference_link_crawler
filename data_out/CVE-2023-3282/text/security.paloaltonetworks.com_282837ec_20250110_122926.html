### Description

A local privilege escalation (PE) vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR engine software running on a Linux operating system enables a local attacker to execute programs with elevated privileges if the attacker has shell access to the engine.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cortex XSOAR 8 | None | All |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.12 | None | All |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.11 | None | All |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.10 | < 6.10.0.250144 on Linux | >= 6.10.0.250144 on Linux |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only to Cortex XSOAR engines installed through the shell method that are running on a Linux operating system.

Please see the following link for more Cortex XSOAR engine installation information:

### Severity: MEDIUM, Suggested Urgency: MODERATE

CVSS-B:
4.9 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:N/R:U/V:C/RE:M/U:Amber](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:N/R:U/V:C/RE:M/U:Amber))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in deployed Cortex XSOAR engines when an updated engine installer is created and used to upgrade the engine from Cortex XSOAR 6.10 build B250144 and all later builds of Cortex XSOAR.
