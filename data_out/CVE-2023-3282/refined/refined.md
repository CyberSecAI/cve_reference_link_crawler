- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource in the Cortex XSOAR engine software. Specifically, the engine allows a local attacker with shell access to execute programs with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local Privilege Escalation (PE) due to incorrect permission assignment (CWE-732).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with shell access to the Cortex XSOAR engine can execute programs with elevated privileges. This could lead to a compromise of the system on which the engine is running, potentially resulting in a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the system and its data. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability when an exploitation is successful.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system running the vulnerable Cortex XSOAR engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs shell access to the Linux system where the vulnerable Cortex XSOAR engine is installed. The vulnerability is only applicable to engines installed through the shell method.
