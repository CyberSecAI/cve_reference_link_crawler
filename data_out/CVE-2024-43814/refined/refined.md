The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43814.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin, by default, shares Automatic Position, Location, and Information (PLI) updates every 60 seconds once the plugin is active and the goTenna is connected. This occurs without encryption, potentially exposing location data if encryption is not explicitly enabled prior to a mission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted transmission of sensitive information (PLI data).
- Default behavior of transmitting PLI data without requiring explicit user action to enable encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of user location data to nearby attackers
- Compromise of confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Adjacent network access (RF) by an attacker within range to receive the unencrypted PLI broadcasts

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be within RF range of the vulnerable device.
- No authentication or user interaction is required for exploitation.
- The attacker must have the capability to capture and interpret RF transmissions.
