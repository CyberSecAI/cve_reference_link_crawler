The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin's default settings are to share Automatic 
Position, Location, and Information (PLI) updates every 60 seconds once 
the plugin is active and goTenna is connected. Users that are unaware of
 their settings and have not activated encryption before a mission may 
accidentally broadcast their location unencrypted. It is advised to 
verify PLI settings are the desired rate and activate encryption prior 
to mission. Update to the latest Plugin to disable this default setting.
