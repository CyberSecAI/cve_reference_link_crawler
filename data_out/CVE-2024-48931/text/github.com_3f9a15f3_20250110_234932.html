# Arbitrary File Read via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS

High

published
GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj
Oct 24, 2024

## Package

https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/
(ZimaOS)

## Affected versions

≤v1.2.4

## Patched versions

1.2.5

## Description

### Summary

The ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>` is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise.

### Details

The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files` parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory.

### PoC

1. Authenticate to the ZimaOS API and obtain a valid session token.
2. Use the following request to manipulate the files parameter and read sensitive system files:

   `GET http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=%2Fetc%2Fshadow`

   Response

```
root:$6$abcd1234$...
user1:$6$efgh5678$...

```

The response includes the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file, which holds password hashes for system users.

### Impact

1. Privilege Escalation: The ability to read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/shadow`, exposes password hashes, which could lead to password cracking and privilege escalation.
2. Data Exposure: Attackers could access configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the server.
3. System Compromise: Exposing critical files increases the risk of full system compromise, potentially allowing attackers to gain administrative control over the server.

### Recommendation

1. Input Validation: Implement strict input validation to ensure that the files parameter can only reference files within a safe, predefined directory. Avoid allowing direct input of file paths from the user.
2. Path Traversal Mitigation:Sanitize the files parameter by removing or blocking special characters such as ../ that may allow directory traversal.Resolve the file path and ensure it is contained within an allowed directory before allowing access.
3. Access Control: Restrict access to sensitive system files such as /etc/shadow by using file access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized processes or users can access them.
4. Logging and Monitoring: Monitor file access attempts for unusual patterns, such as multiple requests for sensitive files, and generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

### Possible Fix Code:

Here’s an example code snippet that restricts file access to a specific directory and prevents path traversal in Python:

```
import os

def get_safe_file(file_path):
    # Define the base directory where files are allowed to be read
    base_dir = "/var/safe_directory/"

    # Normalize and validate the requested file path
    requested_file = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(base_dir, file_path))

    # Check if the file is within the allowed base directory
    if not requested_file.startswith(base_dir):
        return "Access Denied", 403

    # Proceed with reading the file
    try:
        with open(requested_file, 'r') as f:
            return f.read(), 200
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "File Not Found", 404

```

This code ensures that only files within the `/var/safe_directory/` directory can be accessed and prevents traversal outside this directory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
