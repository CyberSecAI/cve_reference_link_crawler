- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation of the `files` parameter in the `/v3/file` API endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22), lack of input validation, unrestricted file access.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Privilege escalation via password hash extraction from `/etc/shadow`
    - Data exposure by accessing sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, database credentials)
    - System compromise, potentially leading to administrative control
- **Attack vectors**: Network, by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a manipulated `files` parameter to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ZimaOS system.
    - Attacker needs network access to the ZimaOS server.
