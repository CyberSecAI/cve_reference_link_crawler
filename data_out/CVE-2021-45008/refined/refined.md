Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions that allow an unprivileged user to gain administrative rights by modifying a "super admin flag" parameter during the login process.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure permissions: The system does not properly validate the user's role before processing the login request, which allows an unprivileged user to elevate their privileges.
- Lack of input validation: The system accepts a modified "super admin flag" parameter (changing it from false to true) during the login process without proper authorization checks.

Impact of exploitation:
An unprivileged user can gain administrative privileges, which allows them to access critical information including financial data like bank account information.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is exploited during the login process.
- It involves capturing the login request and modifying the value of the "super admin flag" parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs a valid user account with low roles.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the login request using a tool like Burp Suite.
- The attacker must be able to modify the captured request by changing the "super admin flag" value from false to true.
