- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The authLdap WordPress plugin versions 2.5.8 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute unintended actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website, thus sending the forged request to the vulnerable site. The attacker themselves do not need to be authenticated.
