- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in FortiWeb's Signed Security mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass cookie tampering protection by deleting FortiWeb's session cookie. This protection is meant to prevent unauthorized modifications of cookies for sites protected by FortiWeb.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disable the cookie tampering protection, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to delete the FortiWeb session cookie. The specifics of how this cookie deletion is achieved are not detailed but it is implied that it is through network based means given the severity rating.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with network access to the FortiWeb device is required. They do not need credentials (PR:N).
