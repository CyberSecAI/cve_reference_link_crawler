| Hello, In the code [here](https://github.com/WordOps/WordOps/blob/ecf20192c7853925e2cb3f8c8378cd0d86ca0d62/wo/cli/plugins/stack_pref.py#L77), the `conf_path` file priviledge is changed after the creation and data writing. A malicious attacker could perform TOCTOU attack to read/write the data before the priviledge changing if he knows the timing of the program execution. This is similar to the  [CVE-2022-23651](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p867-fxfr-ph2w) that the file permission is changed a bit late. There are also other instances of the same issue in the same file. |

| Hello [@nevercodecorrect](https://github.com/nevercodecorrect), Thanks for your report. So to fix this issue, WordOps should set file priviledge before writing data into files ? |

| that could be one way. You could also directly give permissions at creation time like below which is also the [fix](https://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python/commit/62476638986e5b6d7459aca5ef8ce220760226e0) to that known cve  ``` fd = os.open(             self.filename,             flags=os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT,             mode=stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR,         )  os.close(fd)  ``` |
