{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings to construct commands, but it doesn't validate the size of the input parameters against the size of the stack buffer, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network packet can be sent to the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with the ability to send network packets to the device."
