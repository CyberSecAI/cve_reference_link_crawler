Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the potential for HTTP header injection in IBM CICS TX Advanced and Standard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- HTTP Header Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate input that is used to construct HTTP headers. This can lead to the injection of malicious code or control characters into the HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the HTTP headers, which, when interpreted by a user's browser, would allow for the execution of malicious code in the context of the user's session.
- Cache Poisoning: By injecting specific headers, an attacker can manipulate the way a web cache stores data, potentially serving modified content to other users.
- Session Hijacking: An attacker might be able to use injected headers to obtain sensitive information or manipulate session state to gain access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the injection of malicious input into HTTP headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable server that will allow for the injection of malicious input into HTTP headers.
- The attacker doesn't need prior authentication, making this a remote, unauthenticated vulnerability.
- The attacker needs network access to the server.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM CICS TX Advanced version 11.1
- IBM CICS TX Standard all versions (explicitly mentioned version 11.1 has fix)

**Fix:**
- Apply interim fixes from IBM Fix Central:
  - IBM CICS TX Advanced:  `ibm-cics-tx-advanced-image-11.1.0.0-ifix2`
  - IBM CICS TX Standard: `ibm-cics-tx-standard-image-11.1.0.0-ifix2`
