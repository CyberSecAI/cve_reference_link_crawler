- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the FortiMail web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated XSS. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the web browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the FortiMail interface, which will be executed by a user's browser when they view the crafted URL. This allows the attacker to perform actions in the context of the victim user, such as stealing session cookies, modifying web content, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and then trick a victim into clicking on it. The victim must be logged into FortiMail for the XSS attack to be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and external to the FortiMail system. The attacker needs to craft a URL with malicious javascript and social engineer the victim to click on the crafted link.
