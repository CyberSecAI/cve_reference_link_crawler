- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files within PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, there is a lack of validation for the existence of an object before operations are performed on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability during TIF file parsing due to missing object existence validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This could allow an attacker to take control of the user's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious TIF file or visiting a malicious web page containing such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIF file and entice the user to open it with the vulnerable PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required.
