- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPB Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. These scripts could perform actions such as redirecting users to malicious sites, displaying unwanted advertisements, or performing other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could inject scripts via the vulnerable plugin, which are then executed when other users visit the affected pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious user, with at least Contributor-level privileges, can inject malicious scripts into the WordPress site.
