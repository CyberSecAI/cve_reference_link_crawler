Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a password field having the autocomplete attribute enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Autocomplete enabled on password fields. This allows browsers to save and potentially autofill passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access if the device is compromised or accessed by an unintended user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of passwords if a user's browser autofills credentials on a compromised device or if another user gains access to the device where credentials have been saved by the browser. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Confidentiality Risk:** The vulnerability exposes sensitive password information, potentially compromising user accounts and associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to a user's device where the browser has saved the credentials can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Browser Compromise:** If the user's browser is compromised by malware, the saved passwords could be extracted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the user's device where the browser is configured to autofill passwords or to compromise the user's browser where these credentials have been stored.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges other than the ability to access the user's device.

**Additional Notes:**
- Both IBM and NetApp acknowledge this CVE as related to IBM Cognos Analytics.
- NetApp's advisory indicates a CVSS score of 5.5 (Medium) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited locally without user interaction for the purpose of information disclosure.
- The IBM bulletin states the vulnerability has been addressed in IBM Cognos Analytics 11.2.3 and 11.1.7 FP5.
- NetApp states that OnCommand Insight is affected, and provides a link to the fix.
