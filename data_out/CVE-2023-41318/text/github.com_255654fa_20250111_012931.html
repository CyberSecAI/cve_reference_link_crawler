# Unsafe media served inline on download endpoints

Moderate

[turt2live](/turt2live)
published
GHSA-5crw-6j7v-xc72
Sep 8, 2023

## Package

matrix-media-repo
(Binaries/Docker)

## Affected versions

<1.3.0

## Patched versions

1.3.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user can upload an SVG image containing JavaScript to their server. When matrix-media-repo is asked to serve that media via the `/_matrix/media/(r0|v3)/download` endpoint, it would be served with a `Content-Disposition` of `inline`. This can allow JavaScript to run in the browser if a client links to the `/download` endpoint directly.

Server operators which do not share a domain between matrix-media-repo and other services are not affected, but are encouraged to upgrade regardless.

### Patches

[77ec235](https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/commit/77ec2354e8f46d5ef149d1dcaf25f51c04149137) and [bf8abdd](https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/commit/bf8abdd7a5371118e280c65a8e0ec2b2e9bdaf59) fix the issue. Operators should upgrade to v1.3.0 as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

The `Content-Disposition` header can be overridden by the reverse proxy in front of matrix-media-repo to always use `attachment`, defeating this issue at the cost of "worse" user experience when clicking download links.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
