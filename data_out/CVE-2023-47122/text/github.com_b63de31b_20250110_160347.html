# Rekor public keys fetched from upstream API instead of local TUF client.

Moderate

GHSA-xvrc-2wvh-49vc
Nov 10, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/sigstore/gitsign
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>=0.6.0

## Patched versions

v0.8.0

## Description

### Impact

In certain versions of gitsign, Rekor public keys were fetched via the Rekor API, instead of through the local TUF client. If the upstream Rekor server happened to be compromised, gitsign clients could potentially be tricked into trusting incorrect signatures.

There is no known compromise the default public good instance (`rekor.sigstore.dev`) - anyone using this instance is unlikely to be affected.

### Patches

This was fixed in v0.8.0 via [#399](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign/pull/399)

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
