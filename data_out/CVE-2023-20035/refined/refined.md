- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the system CLI in Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root*-level privileges, potentially gaining complete control over the affected system. The impact may vary depending on user access privileges; low-privilege users can escalate to complete control, while administrative users may gain fewer additional privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated local access, either through a local terminal or a management shell interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated local user with privileges to run commands on the affected device.
