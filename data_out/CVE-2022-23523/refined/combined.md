# Reading beyond EOF could lead to infinite loop

Low

[rbradford](/rbradford)
published
GHSA-52h2-m2cf-9jh6
Dec 12, 2022

## Package

cargo

linux-loader
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.8.1

## Patched versions

0.8.1, 0.9.0

## Description

### Impact

The linux-loader crate used the offsets and sizes provided in the ELF headers to determine the offsets to read from. If those offsets pointed beyond the end of the file this could lead to an infinite loop. Virtual Machine Monitors using the `linux-loader` crate could enter an infinite loop if the ELF header of the kernel they are loading was modified in a malicious manner.

### Patches

The issue has been addressed in 0.8.1

### Workarounds

The issue can be mitigated by ensuring that only trusted kernel images are loaded or by verifying that the headers to not point beyond the end of the file.

### References

See: [#125](https://github.com/rust-vmm/linux-loader/pull/125)

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23523

### @likebreath **[likebreath](/likebreath)** commented [Dec 6, 2022](#issue-1479512854)

### Summary of the PR

The ELF header contains offsets that the loader uses to find other structures. If those offsets are beyond the end of the file (or would go past the end of the file) it is essential to error out when attempting to read those. Using `Read::read_exact()` permits this.
