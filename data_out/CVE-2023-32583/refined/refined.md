- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP All Backup plugin (versions <= 2.4.3) lacks sufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability. The plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the website, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or complete site takeover, depending on the actions the attacker can trigger.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with administrative privileges into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to target a user who is logged into the vulnerable website.
