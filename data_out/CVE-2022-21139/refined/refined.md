- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate encryption strength
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak encryption allows for potential compromise.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network position and be unauthenticated.
