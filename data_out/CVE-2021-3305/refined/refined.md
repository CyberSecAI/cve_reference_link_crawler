**Weaknesses:**
- The application does not validate the locations from where it loads libraries or executables.
- This could happen by the software looking for DLL files in directories that are not controlled by the application, leading to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
- This can lead to a full compromise of the system, including data breaches, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to load a library or executable.
- An attacker can place a malicious file with the expected name in a directory that is searched before the legitimate location.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to locations that the application searches for libraries or executables.
- User interaction is required, as the user needs to execute the vulnerable Feishu application.
