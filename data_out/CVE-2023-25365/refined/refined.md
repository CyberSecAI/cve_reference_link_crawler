{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application filters file uploads based on extension but can be bypassed by uploading a file without a filename, just the extension.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure file upload handling, insufficient validation of file types. The application allows files to be uploaded without a name, bypassing extension filters when combined with a file rename",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can upload malicious HTML files disguised as other accepted file types and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when the file is accessed.",
  "Attack vectors": "File upload mechanism. Attacker intercepts the upload request and changes the file extension to one that is accepted by the application while removing the filename.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. Attacker would also need access to the file upload functionality of the application."
