{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password is set without hashing in the change password function within the Portal Profile when 'Use Pimcore Backend Password' is enabled for a PortalUserObject connected to a PimcoreUser.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Password stored in plaintext in the database",
      "Lack of password hashing before saving to database"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of Pimcore user passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Changing the password via the Portal Profile when the 'Use Pimcore Backend Password' is enabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account with a PortalUserObject linked to a PimcoreUser and the 'Use Pimcore Backend Password' setting enabled, and be able to access the portal profile to change the password."
