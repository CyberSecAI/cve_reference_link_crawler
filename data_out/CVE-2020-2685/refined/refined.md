The provided document is a Critical Patch Update Advisory from Oracle, dated January 2020. It details numerous security patches across various Oracle product families. CVE-2020-2685 is among the vulnerabilities addressed and appears in the "Oracle Financial Services Applications Risk Matrix".

Here's the relevant information extracted for CVE-2020-2685:

*   **Product:** Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking
*   **Component:** Infrastructure
*   **Protocol:** HTTP
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth?:** No (but further examination reveals that it is remotely exploitable with authentication)
*   **CVSS v3.0 Risk:**
    *   Base Score: 5.4
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Required
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*   **Supported Versions Affected:** 12.0.1-12.4.0, 14.0.0-14.3.0

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the "Infrastructure" component of Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking, exploitable via the HTTP protocol. While initially marked as "No" for remote exploitation without authentication, the risk matrix also states that the exploit requires privileges. Therefore, it should be considered a vulnerability that needs authentication, but can be exploited remotely.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed in this document. However, it's indicated that the underlying weakness allows for a potential attack over the network.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a low impact on confidentiality and integrity of the system. The availability is not impacted.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the network via HTTP, meaning a remote attacker could potentially exploit it, provided they have the necessary authentication and privileges.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the affected system over the network and must have valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
    * The document includes a general recommendation to apply patches as soon as possible due to the risk posed by successful attacks.
    * It also suggests mitigation techniques such as blocking network protocols or removing privileges, although they may break application functionality and should not be considered long-term solutions.
