- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Jazz Team Server is vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to the lack of the HttpOnly flag on cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the failure to set the HttpOnly flag on cookies, which allows local scripts to access the cookie(s).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute local scripts to access the cookie(s) and potentially transmit them to another site. This can lead to unauthorized access, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of the HttpOnly flag on cookies, enabling malicious scripts to access and potentially exfiltrate cookie data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject and execute scripts within the user's browser context in order to exploit this vulnerability.
