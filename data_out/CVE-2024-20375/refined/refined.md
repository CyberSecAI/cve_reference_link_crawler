- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper parsing of SIP messages in the SIP call processing function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation/parsing of SIP messages, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, which interrupts communications of reliant voice and video devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted SIP message to a vulnerable Cisco Unified CM or Cisco Unified CM SME device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
