# Tenda Router AX12 Vulnerability

This vulnerability lies in the `goform/setIPv6Status` page which influences the lastest version of Tenda Router AX12. (lastest version of this product is [V22.03.01.21\_CN](https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-3237.html))

## Vulnerability description

There is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in function `sub_422CE4`

This function uses `strcpy` to copy the string pointed by `v6` into a stack buffer pointed by `v21`,while `v6` gets in a parameter called `prefixDelegate` and use that input value without any check.

[![image-20220115010231776](/sec-bin/IoT-CVE/raw/main/Tenda/AX12/2/1.png)](/sec-bin/IoT-CVE/blob/main/Tenda/AX12/2/1.png)

So when strcpy is called, a stack overflow occurs, the attacker can easily perform a **DoS Attack**.
