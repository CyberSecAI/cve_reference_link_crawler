  "cve": "CVE-2022-26360",
  "description": "Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, \"RMRR\") for Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions need to remain continuously accessible by the device.  This requirement has been violated. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device may have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.",
  "affected_systems": "All Xen versions supporting PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems with IOMMU hardware are vulnerable. Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them, and only when any such device has an associated RMRR or unity map, can leverage the vulnerability.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Violation of the requirement that mappings of RMRR or unity map regions remain continuously accessible by the associated device once the device is active.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of IOMMU mappings for RMRR (Intel VT-d) and unity map (AMD-Vi) regions."
    ],
    "impact": "The precise impact is system specific, but would likely be a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device may have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption." ,
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious x86 guest with a passed-through physical device that has an associated RMRR or unity map. DMA or interrupts from the device may trigger the vulnerability." ,
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious x86 guest with a passed-through physical device with associated RMRR or unity map."
  },
    "mitigation": "Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests when the devices have associated RMRRs / unity maps will avoid the vulnerability."
