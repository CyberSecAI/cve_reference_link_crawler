The IT security researchers at Manchester, England-based NCC Group have released a technical advisory explaining how Nuki Smart Locks were vulnerable to a plethora of attack possibilities.

It is worth noting that Nuki Home Solutions is a Graz, Austria-based supplier of smart home solutions in Europe. Here is a detailed overview of the eleven flaws in Nuki’s locks.

### Lack of Certificate Validation on TLS Communications

This flaw is tracked as [CVE-2022-32509](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32509) and affects Nuki Smart Lock version 3.0. As per the NCC Group research, the company didn’t implement SSL/TLS certificate validation on its Smart lock and Bridge devices. Without SSL/TLS certificate validation, attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks and access network traffic sent through an encrypted channel.

### Stack Buffer Overflow Parsing JSON Responses

Tracked as [CVE-2022-32504](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32504), this vulnerability affects Nuki Smart Lock 3.0. The issue can allow an attacker to get arbitrary code execution privilege on the device. The flaw is found in the code that implements the JSON objects parsing received from the SSE WebSocket, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

### Stack Buffer Overflow Parsing HTTP Parameters

As per NCC Group’s [technical writeup](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/07/25/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-nuki-smart-locks-cve-2022-32509-cve-2022-32504-cve-2022-32502-cve-2022-32507-cve-2022-32503-cve-2022-32510-cve-2022-32506-cve-2022-32508-cve-2/), the code responsible for overseeing the HTTP API parameter parsing logic causes a stack buffer overflow. It could be exploited to perform arbitrary code execution. This flaw is tracked as [CVE-2022-32502](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32502) and was discovered in Nuki Bridge version 1.

### Broken Access Controls in the BLE Protocol

The flaw is tracked as [CVE-2022-32507](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32507) and affects Nuki Smart Lock 3.0. Research revealed that inadequate access control measures were used in the [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://hackread.com/tesla-model-x-key-fob-hacked/) Nuki API implementation, which could allow users to send out high-privilege commands to the Keyturner without being authorized for it.

### TAG Exposed via Test Points

This flaw is classified as [CVE-2022-32503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32503) and impacts Nuki Keypad. The TAG Exposed issue exposed the JTAG hardware interfaces on the affected devices.

Exploiting this flaw can allow an attacker to use the JTAG boundary scan feature to control code execution on the processor, debug the firmware, and read/alter the internal/external flash memory content. However, the attacker must have physical access to the circuit board to exploit the scan feature.

### Sensitive Information Sent Over an Unencrypted Channel

This vulnerability is assigned [CVE-2022-32510](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32510) and impacts Nuki Bridge version 1. The Bridge exposes the HTTP API using an unencrypted channel to access an administrative interface. The attacker can passively gather communication between the HTTP API and a client after accessing any device connected to the local network. A malicious actor can conveniently impersonate a legit user and access the full set of API endpoints.

### WD Interfaces Exposed via Test Points

Tracked as [CVE-2022-32506](https://vulmon.com/vulnerabilitydetails?qid=CVE-2022-32506), the flaw exposed SWD hardware interfaces and was identified in Nuki smart lock 3.0. The attacker can use the SWD debug feature after having physical access to the circuit board, control the processor’s code execution, and debug the firmware.

### Denial of Service via Unauthenticated HTTP API Messages

This flaw is classified as [CVE-2022-32508](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32508) and impacts Nuki Bridge version 1. The flaw made devices vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks if the attacker used specially crafted [HTTP packets](https://hackread.com/cloudflare-thwarted-largest-ever-https-ddos-attack/). Thus, impacting access to the Bridge and rendering the device unstable.

### Denial of Service via Unauthenticated BLE packets

Tracked as [CVE-2022-32505](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-32505), this flaw made the impacted devices vulnerable to DoS attack through specially crafted Bluetooth Low energy packets. This could affect Keyturner’s availability and make the device unstable. Most BLE characteristics were found to be vulnerable to this issue.

### Insecure Invite Keys Implementation

This flaw impacts the Nuki Smart Lock app version 2.22.5.5 (661). The invite token created for identifying a user during an invitation process is used to encrypt/decrypt the invite keys on the Nuki servers. A threat actor can easily take full control of the servers through this flaw and leak sensitive data.

### Opener Name Could Be Overwritten Without Authentication

The Nuki Opener is impacted by this vulnerability that emerged from an insecure Opener Bluetooth Low energy implementation, allowing malicious actors to change the BLE device name. The device allowed an unauthenticated attacker to change the BLE device name.

### Current status

The NCC Group informed Nuki about these flaws on 20th April 2022, and the company quickly responded. On 6th May 2022, Nuki contacted NCC Group regarding the progress on fixes. On 9th June 2022, patches were released for all vulnerabilities, after which NCC Group released a technical advisory.

# Multiple Security Flaws Found In Nuki Smart Locks

 by [Abeerah Hashim](https://latesthackingnews.com/author/abeerah/)  July 28, 2022   written by [Abeerah Hashim](https://latesthackingnews.com/author/abeerah/)   July 28, 2022     [![Nuki smart locks flaws](data:image/svg+xml... "Nuki smart locks")](https://latesthackingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nuki-smart-locks.jpg)     *5.8K* 129SHARES[Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flatesthackingnews.com%2F2022%2F07%2F28%2Fmultiple-security-flaws-found-in-nuki-smart-locks%2F)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Multiple%20Security%20Flaws%20Found%20In%20Nuki%20Smart%20Locks&url=https://latesthackingnews.com/2022/07/28/multiple-security-flaws-found-in-nuki-smart-locks/&via=7H3Wh173R4bb17)

Researchers found numerous security flaws in various Nuki Smart locks. Exploiting the vulnerabilities could affect the smart locks’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Nuki Smart Locks Flaws

According to an [advisory](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/07/25/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-nuki-smart-locks-cve-2022-32509-cve-2022-32504-cve-2022-32502-cve-2022-32507-cve-2022-32503-cve-2022-32510-cve-2022-32506-cve-2022-32508-cve-2/) from the NCC Group, their researchers found eleven different security flaws in Nuki Smart Lock and Bridge products.

Nuki Smart Locks offer keyless security mechanisms that recognize the users’ mobile device for unlocking. The lock opens upon detecting a known mobile device approaching near, hence ditching the need for manual commands. In addition, the locks also empower the users to monitor lock status via their smartphones, manage access permissions as needed, and more.

These explicit functionalities are not only useful, but can be dangerous if exploited negatively. That’s what the NCC Group suggests in its latest discovery.

### List Of Vulnerabilities:

Specifically, the researchers found the following eleven bugs riddling with the locks’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

* **CVE-2022-32509 (CVSS 8.5):** The lack of SSL/TLS validation for the network traffic risked MiTM attacks.
* **CVE-2022-32504 (CVSS 8.8):** stack overflow vulnerability in the code parsing JSON objects received from the SSE WebSocket could allow arbitrary code execution attacks.
* **CVE-2022-32502 (CVSS 8.0):** a stack buffer overflow affecting the HTTP API parameter parsing logic code could allow an adversary for arbitrary code execution.
* **CVE-2022-32507 (CVSS 8.0):** insufficient access controls in the [Bluetooth](https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/02/10/an-android-bluetooth-vulnerability-allowed-exploit-without-user-interaction/) Low Energy (BLE) Nuki API allowed unprivileged users to send high privileged commands to the Smart Lock’s Keyturner.
* **CVE-2022-32503 (CVSS 7.6):** Exposed JTAG hardware interfaces in Nuki Fob and Nuki Keypad allowed an attacker to manage code execution on the device using the JTAG’s boundary scan. Exploiting this vulnerability could also allow the adversary to debug the firmware and modify the internal and external flash memory.
* **CVE-2022-32510 (CVSS 7.1):** An HTTP API in the Nuki Bridge provided the admin interface via an unencrypted channel, thus exposing the communication between the client and the API. An attacker with local access to the network could intercept the data.
* **CVE-2022-32506 (CVSS 6.4):** Exposed SWD hardware interfaces in the Nuki Bridge and Nuki Smart Lock could allow an attacker with physical access to the device to debug the firmware, control the execution of codes, and read or modify the contents of the flash memory.
* **CVE-2022-32508 (CVSS 6.5):** An unauthenticated attacker could use maliciously crafted HTTP packets to induce a denial of service state in the target Nuki Bridge device.
* **CVE-2022-32505 (CVSS 6.5):** An unauthenticated attacker could use maliciously crafted BLE packets to induce a DoS state on the target Nuki Smart Lock devices.

### Other Low-Risk Flaws In Nuki Products

* **Insecure invite key implementation (CVSS 1.9):** The Invite token for the Nuki Smart Lock apps were used to encrypt and decrypt the invite keys on servers. Hence, an attacker accessing the server could also access sensitive data and impersonate users.
* **Overwriting opener name without authentication (CVSS 2.1):** insecure implementation of the Opener BLE characteristics could allow an unauthenticated attacker to change the BLE device name.

## Patches Deployed

After discovering the bugs, the researchers informed the vendors about the matter, following which, Nuki deployed patches. The researchers have confirmed that the vendors have deployed the fixes across Nuki Smart Lock, Nuki Bridge, Nuki Smart Lock app, and other affected products with the latest updates. Hence now, all users should update their respective Nuki [smart devices](https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/10/01/researcher-creates-ransomware-attack-that-can-target-smart-coffee-makers/) with the latest updates to receive the patches.
