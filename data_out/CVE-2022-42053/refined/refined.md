Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-42053:

**Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection #4

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the `setPortMapping` function within the `/goform/module` endpoint. The `portMappingServer` parameter is passed to the underlying `netctrl` binary without proper sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
    *   Lack of input sanitization
    *   Direct use of user-provided input in system commands.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution as the application user on the affected system.
    *   Potential for complete system compromise.
    *   Starting telnetd with a shell to gain root shell without authentication

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted `POST` request to the `/goform/module` endpoint with `setPortMapping` action.
    *   The `portMappingServer` parameter within the JSON payload contains the malicious OS command injection.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface (either local or via remote web management).
    *   The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request with the malicious command in the `portMappingServer` parameter.
    *   Access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered within the `netctrl` binary's `advance_set_port_map_cfg` function.
*   The attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are then executed by the system.
*   The blog post demonstrates the exploitation of this vulnerability by injecting a command to start telnetd, gaining a shell without authentication.
*   The post mentions that other command injections are also present in the router's firmware, specifically hotel mode and guest SSID initiation.
