Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper access control in the Intel ISPC software installers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The installers, specifically those before version 1.19.0, have inadequate access control, allowing an authenticated user to potentially escalate privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could achieve privilege escalation.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable installer is being used. The user also needs to perform a UI-driven interaction.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the Intel ISPC software installers before version 1.19.0. An authenticated local user could exploit improper access controls in the installer to gain elevated privileges on the system.
