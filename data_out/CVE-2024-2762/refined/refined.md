- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape certain Gallery settings before displaying them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Author role can inject malicious scripts that would execute when a user views a page or post containing the affected gallery, potentially leading to account compromise of high-privileged users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the "Custom Attributes" field of a Gallery's settings. The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted payload is rendered on a page or post where the gallery is embedded, and a user moves their mouse over an image within the gallery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least the Author role in the WordPress site. They also need to be able to create or edit galleries and have access to the gallery settings.
