* The specific impact varies depending on the function being accessed without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the WordPress Pardot plugin.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user accessing the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with low privileges, such as a subscriber.
*   No special network access is needed, just a regular user account.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability has a low severity (CVSS 4.3)
*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 2.1.0 of the plugin, and fixed in version 2.1.1.
*   A virtual patch has been issued to mitigate this issue until the plugin is updated.
