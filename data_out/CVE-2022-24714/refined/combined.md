# Unwanted disclosure of hosts and related data, linked to decommissioned services

Moderate

[nilmerg](/nilmerg)
published
GHSA-qcmg-vr56-x9wf
Mar 8, 2022

## Package

icingaweb2
(Icinga)

## Affected versions

<=2.9.5

## Patched versions

2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10

## Description

### Impact

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use **service custom variables** in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to the following content:

* Contactgroups
* Contacts
* Hosts
* Host events
* Host comments
* Host downtimes
* Hostgroups

Note that this only applies if a role has **implicitly** permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users.

### Patches

This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, ask for assistance on the [forums](https://community.icinga.com).

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24714

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
