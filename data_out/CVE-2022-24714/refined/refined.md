Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Icinga Web 2 handles role restrictions related to service custom variables and decommissioned service objects when the IDO writer is enabled. Specifically, when a role is granted implicit access to hosts based on service access, the system incorrectly allows access to host information even after the related services have been decommissioned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is that role-based access control, intended to limit access to specific resources, fails to properly revoke access to host-related data when the associated service objects are decommissioned.
*   **Implicit Permissions:** The vulnerability arises from implicitly granted host permissions via associated services. If the role has explicit host access through other means, the vulnerability is not triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker with a role that has *implicit* access to hosts (through access to at least one service) can view the following information related to hosts, even if those hosts and services have been decommissioned:

*   Contactgroups
*   Contacts
*   Hosts
*   Host events
*   Host comments
*   Host downtimes
*   Hostgroups

This unintended access to potentially sensitive data can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Role-Based Access:** Attackers leverage their assigned roles within the Icinga Web 2 system to gain access.
*   **Decommissioned Services:** The vulnerability is triggered when service objects associated with these roles are decommissioned.
*  **Service Custom Variables**: The vulnerability is triggered when role restrictions are applied using service custom variables.
*   **IDO Writer Enabled:** The presence of an enabled IDO writer is a precondition for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Icinga Web 2 User:** The attacker must be a valid user with an assigned role within the Icinga Web 2 system.
*   **Role with Implicit Host Access:** The attacker's role needs to have implicit access to hosts based on access to service objects that have been decommissioned.
*   **Knowledge of Decommissioned Services:** The attacker needs to be aware of the decommissioned services for which the role has previously had access to leverage the information disclosure.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit diffs show the code changes made to address this vulnerability:
*   The fix involves modifying the SQL queries in `HostcontactQuery.php`, `HostserviceproblemsummaryQuery.php`, `IdoQuery.php` and `ServicecontactQuery.php` to ensure the correct `objecttype_id` is checked when joining tables, ensuring only data for *active* objects is included in the results.
