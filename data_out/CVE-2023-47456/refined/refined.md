The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AX1806 router firmware version v1.0.0.1, which is likely related to CVE-2023-47456.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `sub_455D4` function, which is called by `fromSetWirelessRepeat`. The `v9` variable, obtained from the `wpapsk_crypto` HTTP request parameter, is not checked for size. If `v9` is not equal to `tkip&aes`, it's copied into a fixed-size array `v16` without boundary checks, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of size validation on the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.
    *   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** Copying an arbitrarily large string into a smaller stack buffer.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided PoC demonstrates that the router crashes when the exploit is triggered. A stack overflow can overwrite critical return addresses or other stack data, which may cause the device to crash and become unusable.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the provided PoC results in a crash, the stack overflow vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for RCE if the overflow is carefully crafted to overwrite the return address with an attacker controlled address and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiExtraSet` endpoint.
    *   **`wpapsk_crypto` parameter:** The attacker controls the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter to cause the stack overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
    *   **Authentication:** Based on the given PoC, the attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid password cookie.
