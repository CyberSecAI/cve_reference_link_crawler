Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.
*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically during file uploads.
*   The system allows upload of `.xml` or `.svg` files containing malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed in the context of the application's domain when these files are viewed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user's browser when they view the uploaded file.
*   **Insecure file upload:** The application allows the upload of potentially harmful file types such as `.svg` and `.xml` without proper sanitization of their content.
*   **Insufficient input validation/sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the content of uploaded files, allowing the execution of malicious scripts embedded within them.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session hijacking:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookies, potentially granting them unauthorized access to the application and allowing them to perform actions as the victim. This is demonstrated by the cookie.php exfiltration script.
*   **Account takeover:** By stealing the admin's session cookie, an attacker could gain full control over the CMS instance.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An authenticated user with the 'Files' permission can upload malicious `.svg` or `.xml` files containing XSS payloads.
*   **User interaction:** The attack requires another user, such as the admin, to navigate to the 'Files' menu and click/view the malicious file. This triggers the execution of the XSS payload within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated user with file upload permission:** An attacker must have a valid user account with the necessary file upload privileges, specifically the 'Files' permission under 'Admin Tabs' to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Web server access:** To capture the stolen cookies, the attacker needs access to a web server to host the `cookie.php` script and receive the stolen data.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit works by injecting JavaScript within an uploaded `.svg` or `.xml` file. The provided `xss.svg` and `xss.xml` files demonstrate how the JavaScript is embedded to capture the user's cookies when the file is viewed.
*   The attacker must ensure other users including the admin are logged off for the cookie grabbing to work correctly once the admin logs back in and navigates to the "Files" menu.
