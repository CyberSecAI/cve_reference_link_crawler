- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter from a REST route before using it in an SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through a REST route, specifically `/h5vp/v1/video/1`, where the `id` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable REST endpoint.
