- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer. This occurs when parsing a specially crafted TIFF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: A user must be tricked into opening a malicious TIFF file using one of the affected applications (JT2Go, Teamcenter Visualization).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIFF file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable version of the affected software.
