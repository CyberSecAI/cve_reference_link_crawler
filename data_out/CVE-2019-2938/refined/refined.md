Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-2938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is not explicitly stated in the provided documents but is related to a flaw within the MariaDB/MySQL codebase.
*   It leads to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a flaw that leads to a denial-of-service condition in MariaDB.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS). This means the database server becomes unavailable, impacting services that rely on it.
*   Some documents mention that other vulnerabilities could lead to "unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server" - while not directly attributed to CVE-2019-2938, it suggests that depending on the vulnerability mix, this could be part of a chain of exploits that might lead to greater harm.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is generally described as "remote," indicating the vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   Some documents specify this as a network attack, with some cases requiring high privilege access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable MariaDB/MySQL server.
*   In some cases, a high privileged attacker may be required.
*   No other specific technical requirements are stated, suggesting the vulnerability may be exploitable with basic networking knowledge and the ability to send malicious requests.

**Additional details:**

*   Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability affects MariaDB, and some identify affected versions.
*   The vulnerability is mentioned in the context of security updates for various Linux distributions (openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora) and NetApp products.
*   The information provided is consistent with the general description of a remote DoS vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2019-2938:**

CVE-2019-2938 is a remote denial-of-service vulnerability in MariaDB/MySQL. An attacker can cause the database server to become unavailable, disrupting services that rely on it by sending specially crafted packets. It is also found in conjunction with many other CVEs related to MySQL/MariaDB.

The provided documents do not give specific technical details of the vulnerability itself, but the fact that multiple vendors issued updates to fix it suggests that the underlying problem was a widespread issue within MariaDB/MySQL.
