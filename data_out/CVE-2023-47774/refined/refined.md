  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Jetpack plugin for WordPress versions prior to 12.7 is vulnerable to clickjacking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Clickjacking vulnerability. This allows a malicious actor to trick users into clicking a webpage element that is not visible or is disguised as something else.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful clickjacking attack could trick users into performing unintended actions on a website, potentially leading to compromise of sensitive data or unauthorized actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves tricking users into interacting with hidden or disguised webpage elements.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage that can overlay or trick the user into interacting with the vulnerable webpage. This does not require direct access to the server or the website's admin panel but rather relies on user interaction."
