# Missing escaping of { in Velocity escapetool allows remote code execution

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-hf43-47q4-fhq5
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-velocity
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.1, < 14.10.19
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.4
>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.9-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.19
15.5.4
15.9-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The HTML escaping of escaping tool that is used in XWiki doesn't escape `{`, which, when used in certain places, allows XWiki syntax injection and thereby remote code execution.

To reproduce in an XWiki installation, open `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/Panels/PanelLayoutUpdate?place=%7B%7B%2Fhtml%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bvelocity%7D%7D%23evaluate(%24request.eval)%7B%7B%2Fvelocity%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D&eval=Hello%20from%20URL%20Parameter!%20I%20got%20programming%3A%20%24services.security.authorization.hasAccess(%27programming%27)` where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation. If this displays `You are not admin on this place Hello from URL Parameter! I got programming: true`, the installation is vulnerable.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed on XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9 RC1.

### Workarounds

Apart from upgrading, there is no generic workaround. However, replacing `$escapetool.html` by `$escapetool.xml` in XWiki documents fixes the vulnerability. In a standard XWiki installation, we're only aware of the document `Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate` that exposes this vulnerability, patching this document is thus a workaround. Any extension could expose this vulnerability and might thus require patching, too.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
