The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46179.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an assertion failure in `file.cpp:275` within the `InputFile::readx` function. Specifically, the assertion `(unsigned)len <= buf->getSize()` fails. This indicates that the code attempts to read more data than the provided buffer can hold. This issue is triggered due to a malformed Mach-O file and specifically with a malformed or crafted linker command in the Mach-O file, which results in an invalid length calculation when reading data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Assertion failure due to incorrect length calculation when reading data.
- Inadequate input validation for Mach-O file linker commands.
- Potential buffer overflow due to the incorrect length check.
- The code doesn't properly validate the size of linker commands when unpacking Mach-O files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to the assertion failure, leading to a denial-of-service.
- Potential for memory corruption or other undefined behavior if the assertion was not present and the code continued reading beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted or malformed Mach-O file that contains a bad linker command, causing an incorrect length calculation during unpacking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed Mach-O file to UPX for processing.
- The attacker can be a local or remote user who is able to feed a crafted file to the vulnerable application.
