{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used in `commit_trailers_filter.rb` that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `FILTER_REGEXP` regex, particularly `\\s*(.+)\\s+` (represented by `AUTHOR_REGEXP` and its surroundings), is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a commit message with a specific structure that triggers the vulnerable regex."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) by exhausting server CPU resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can inject a specially crafted commit message via the 'Commit message' field when creating or editing a file.",
      "The ReDoS can be triggered by simply making a `GET` request to a specific branch's commits page, where the crafted commit message exists. This can be achieved through CSRF by embedding the vulnerable URL in a markdown field or an external website."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create or edit files and their commit messages within a project."
