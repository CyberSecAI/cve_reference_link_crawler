Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause isn't explicitly stated but it is described as "new vulnerabilities" discovered by a security research organization during in-depth testing. The vulnerabilities exist in SS&C Blue Prism Enterprise.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The exact nature of the vulnerabilities isn't disclosed, but the severity is labeled as "critical" with potential "critical consequences".
*   The vulnerabilities can be exploited under "very limited conditions".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The potential impact is "critical," suggesting severe consequences if exploited. However, specific impacts (e.g., data breach, system compromise) are not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are not clearly defined, but the text implies that exploiting the vulnerabilities requires several complex preconditions. The limited conditions needed for exploitation suggest it isn't easily achievable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would require the ability to meet several complex pre-requisites, and the conditions are "very limited".
*   The content indicates that exploitation is "extremely restricted" when Blue Prism's Robotic Operating Model (ROM) security practices are implemented. This suggests the attacker needs to bypass these security controls

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** Blue Prism has released patches for all versions of SS&C Blue Prism Enterprise starting at version 6.4. The patches are incorporated into version 7.1. For version 6.10, the resolution is provided in 6.10.5.
*   **Cloud Platform:** The Blue Prism Cloud platform is not affected.
*   **ROM Practices:** Implementing Blue Prism's ROM security practices significantly reduces the risk of exploitation. These include:
    *   Setting up Blue Prism platform components in a logically secured network.
    *   Limiting access to approved devices (e.g., controllers connecting via RDP to interactive clients).
    *   Allow-listing inbound and outbound connections where possible.

This information provides a high-level overview of the vulnerabilities, but lacks specific technical details, likely to protect users until patches are widely deployed.
