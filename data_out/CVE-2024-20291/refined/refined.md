- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect hardware programming that occurs when configuration changes are made to port channel member ports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces. Specifically, ACL entries are not correctly applied to the hardware when changes are made to the port channel members.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send traffic that should be blocked through the affected device, potentially gaining access to network resources that should be protected by ACLs.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker sends traffic through an affected device. The attacker doesn't need any credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco switch. No special capabilities are mentioned.
