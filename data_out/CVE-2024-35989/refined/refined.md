Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-35989.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the attempt to migrate a perf context during the removal of the idxd driver on single-CPU systems. Specifically, when the driver is unloaded, a registered offline callback is invoked as part of the cleanup. If there's only one CPU online, no valid target exists for the perf context migration, which leads to a kernel oops.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of validation for a valid migration target when a CPU goes offline.
- Improper handling of the perf context migration during driver removal on single-CPU systems

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash (oops) on single-CPU systems when unloading the idxd driver.
- System instability due to the kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unloading the idxd driver on a single-CPU system. This can be triggered by an authorized user or through a malicious script or program that manipulates the system's drivers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to unload kernel modules, generally requiring root or administrator privileges.
- The attacker needs to target a single-CPU system.
