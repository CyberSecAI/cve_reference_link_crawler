- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When pages bookmarked in the FortiOS SSL-VPN webportal use the Single Sign-On (SSO) feature, the user's webportal login and password are included in a JavaScript file sent client-side.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. User credentials (login and password) are exposed in a client-side JavaScript file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who can access the client-side JavaScript file (e.g., by intercepting network traffic or having access to the user's browser) can obtain the user's SSL-VPN webportal login and password.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (man-in-the-middle), or access to the client's browser session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the client and the SSL-VPN portal or have access to the client's browser session to obtain the JavaScript containing the credentials.
