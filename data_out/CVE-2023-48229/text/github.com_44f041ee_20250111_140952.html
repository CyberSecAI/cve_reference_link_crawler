# Out-of-bounds write in the radio driver for Contiki-NG nRF platforms

Moderate

[nfi](/nfi)

GHSA-rcwv-xwc9-5hp2
Feb 14, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 4.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the read\_frame function in the arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c module.

More specifically, the read\_frame function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet, which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length, it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request [#2741](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2741) to patch the system.
