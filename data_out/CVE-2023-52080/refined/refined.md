  "CVE-2023-52080": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "BIOS UEFI firmware has an overflow vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An overflow vulnerability exists in the BIOS UEFI firmware.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local NVRAM variable access can exploit this by modifying NVRAM variables on the SPI Flash. This can lead to memory data corruption which can cause a system crash when critical data is affected.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to NVRAM variables.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to modify NVRAM variables."
