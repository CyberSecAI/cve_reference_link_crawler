- Improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NCI files within the Omron CX-Position module. This lack of proper validation leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). The software does not properly restrict operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, which results in memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction: the target must open a malicious NCI file.
- Local attack vector (AV:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious NCI file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file on a vulnerable system running the affected Omron software.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in CX-Position versions 2.5.3 and prior.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The vulnerability was reported by xina1i, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
