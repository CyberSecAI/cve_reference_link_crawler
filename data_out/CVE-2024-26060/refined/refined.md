- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low privileges and user interaction (UI:R) is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to inject malicious scripts that will be stored and executed when other users access the affected page or content.
