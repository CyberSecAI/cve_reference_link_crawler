Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `vmsvga3dSetLightData` function of Oracle VirtualBox.
- The core issue is the insufficient validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write data past the end of a buffer due to a lack of proper input validation. This type of vulnerability is a classic memory corruption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A successful exploit allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges from the guest system to the hypervisor level.
- **Code Execution:** With elevated privileges in the context of the hypervisor, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the host system, leading to complete compromise of the virtualized environment and, potentially, the host system itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some level of access to the guest operating system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Targeted Function:** The attack targets the `vmsvga3dSetLightData` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High-Privileged Code Execution on Guest:** An attacker must first be able to execute code with elevated privileges within the guest OS. This is a critical prerequisite for this exploit to work.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.
- Oracle has released a patch to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by anhdaden of STAR Labs, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The Gentoo advisory indicates that VirtualBox versions prior to 5.2.40, 6.0.20, and 6.1.6 are affected by this CVE.
