- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control. Specifically, a lack of proper checks for authorization, authentication, or nonce tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be limited to higher-privileged users. The specific impact will vary depending on the function that can be exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable function without having the necessary privileges. They do not need to be authenticated.
