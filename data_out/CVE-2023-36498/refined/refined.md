- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tunnelname` parameter within the PPTP client functionality is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of shell metacharacters. The unsanitized input is directly used as part of a shell command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the router.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=.../admin/pptp_client?form=client_list` with a malicious `tunnelname` parameter within the JSON payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative access to the web interface of the TP-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router.
