## Description

We - The [Zalo Security Lab](https://zalo.me/security.html) team - have identified a potential security vulnerability in [SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs).

If you are NOT the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know at `security@zalo.me`!

### Summary

SRS's `/api/v1/vhosts/vid-<id>?callback=<payload>` endpoint didn't filter the callback function name which led to injecting malicious javascript payloads and executing XSS ( Cross-Site Scripting).

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38576496/288379847-37b1a2a3-86d7-4272-97f7-bdf64000b2f3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38576496/288379847-37b1a2a3-86d7-4272-97f7-bdf64000b2f3.png)

### Details

When accessing `http://localhost:1985/console/en_index.html?x#/vhosts/vid-<id>` the website will automatically call the callback API endpoint and create a script for it.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38576496/288386192-b1af6513-25c0-4ee9-b7ed-9d1c730549e2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38576496/288386192-b1af6513-25c0-4ee9-b7ed-9d1c730549e2.png)

However, the callback function is modifiable which leads to injecting malicious javascript payloads into the callback. Therefore, the attacker can modify the URL into

`http://localhost:1985/console/en_index.html?x#/vhosts/vid-xsedfv%3Fcallback=confirm(document.domain)%252f%252f` the XSS will be execute.

### Impact

This issue may lead to Cross-Site Scripting.

If the server uses the older version than v5.0.157, v5.0-b1, v6.0.48 this flaw can be used for the earlier Command Injection vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
