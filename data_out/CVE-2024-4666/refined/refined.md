### CVE-2024-4666
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Borderless â€“ Widgets, Elements, Templates and Toolkit for Elementor & Gutenberg" WordPress plugin, affecting versions up to and including 1.5.3.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in multiple widgets of the plugin. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages via user-supplied attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts are permanently stored in the database and executed when users access the affected page.
-   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before storing it.
-   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied data when outputting it to web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session.
-   **Account Takeover:** Malicious JavaScript can be used to steal cookies and session information potentially leading to account hijacking.
-   **Data Theft:** Attackers might steal sensitive information through injected scripts, such as login credentials, personal data, or other confidential information.
-   **Website Defacement:** Malicious code might be used to deface the website content and redirect users to harmful pages.
-   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could potentially use the injected scripts to distribute malware to site visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Plugin Widgets:** The vulnerability is located in multiple widgets provided by the plugin.
-   **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious scripts through input fields in the widget settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** Attackers must have an authenticated WordPress account with at least "Contributor" level access or above.
-   **Plugin Usage:**  The attacker must be able to create or edit posts/pages, and use the vulnerable plugin's widgets.
-   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require any user interaction other than accessing the compromised page.
-   **Network Access:** Remote access is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided source code snippets show the following:
- The `render()` functions within the widgets are not sanitizing user input properly when they are echoed in the HTML.
- Specifically the following files and lines are affected
   -  `modules/elementor/widgets/circular-progress-bar.php#L427`

   - `modules/elementor/widgets/testimonial.php#L905`
- Patched files use `esc_attr` and `esc_url` to properly escape HTML attributes where needed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was publicly published on May 14, 2024.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.5.4 of the plugin.

**Remediation:**
-   Users of the plugin should update to version 1.5.4 or later.
