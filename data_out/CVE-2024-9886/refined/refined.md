Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP Baidu Map plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes to the `baidu_map` shortcode are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of sanitization and escaping, allowing malicious scripts to be injected via the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode. When a user accesses these injected pages, the malicious scripts will execute in their browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is the `baidu_map` shortcode.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious payload within the shortcode's attributes.
*   This payload is then stored in the database, for example, by injecting it into a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access. This level of access allows users to create and edit posts/pages, including the ability to utilize shortcodes.
