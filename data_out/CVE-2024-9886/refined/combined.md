### Description

The WP Baidu Map plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'baidu\_map' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

作者居然懒得提供一个对话框给你填百度地图 ak 码。 你必须去后台文件系统去编辑源码。
然后，你居然还得自己想办法去找目的地经纬度值，他也不告诉你到哪里去找，找到后再人工填写到一个冗长繁琐的表格里去，包括你的姓名，地址，电邮，电话等等。 what the hell???
Compared with many other plugins for Google maps, this plugin is extremely difficult to use, seems half baked and amateurish. Needs lots of improvement!

打开百度地图后，设置界面的插入按钮显示不了，也无法下拉。
