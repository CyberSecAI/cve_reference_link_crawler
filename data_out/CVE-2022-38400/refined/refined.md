Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the "thanks" module of the Mailform Pro CGI application, which stores user input data temporarily for a specified duration (default 30 seconds).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** The application allows retrieval of user input data via a specific URL within a 30-second window after form submission. This data is exposed in JSON format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of User Input Data:** An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information submitted through the form. This includes names, addresses, email addresses, and other form field data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URL:** The attacker must entice a user who recently submitted a form to access a URL under the attacker's control.
- **Time-Based:** The attack must be executed within the 30-second window after the victim submits the form to retrieve the temporary data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious link, possibly by sending a link in the form of a confirmation or other automated message.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to be ready to exploit the 30 second window, however, if the attacker controls the malicious link that the user will click, they are also controlling when the data is requested, which removes the time constraint from the attacker perspective.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is only present when the "thanks" module is enabled.
- The vendor has released patches and updated versions of the software to address the vulnerability.
- A workaround is to disable the "thanks" module.
