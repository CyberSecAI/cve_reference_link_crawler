Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3605

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query within the WP Hotel Booking plugin. Specifically, the `room_type` parameter of the `/wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms` REST API endpoint is vulnerable.

*   **Weakness:**  The plugin fails to sanitize or properly prepare the `room_type` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the existing query, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.

*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `/wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms` REST API endpoint by manipulating the `room_type` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they can trigger the vulnerability directly.
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the affected WordPress instance and knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and parameter.

**Affected Software:**

*   **Plugin:** WP Hotel Booking
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 2.1.0
*   **Patched Version:** 2.1.1
