- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the ims service, which allows for potential AT command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Missing authorization (CWE-862), leading to a vulnerability where an attacker can inject AT commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege without requiring additional execution privileges or user interaction.
- **Attack vectors**:  Local attack vector, with no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the device.
