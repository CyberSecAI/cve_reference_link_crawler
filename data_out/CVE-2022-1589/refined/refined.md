- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks and CSRF protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect authorization: Unauthenticated users can modify plugin settings.
    - Missing CSRF protection: Settings can be modified via CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify plugin settings, potentially leading to unintended behavior or further compromise.  The specific setting that can be changed is `rwl_page` and `rwl_redirect_field`. In the example provided these are set to `changed-by-attacker` and `404` respectively, and `sesame-open` and `404` in the CSRF example.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Direct HTTP requests: An attacker can directly send HTTP requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
    - CSRF attacks: An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, sends requests to modify plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website, or in the case of a CSRF attack, entice a logged-in user to visit a crafted webpage.
