RHSA-2024:1864 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2024:1864 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Images](#containers)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.8 for OpenShift image enhancement and security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

A new image is available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.8, running on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 and 3.11, and 4.3.

This is an enhancement and security update with Important impact rating and
package name 'rh-sso7-keycloak'. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is an integrated sign-on solution, available as a
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift containerized image. The Red Hat
Single Sign-On for OpenShift image provides an authentication server that
you can use to log in centrally, log out, and register. You can also manage
user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web
services.

Security Fix(es):

* Authorization Bypass (CVE-2023-6544)
* Log Injection during WebAuthn authentication or registration (CVE-2023-6484)
* path transversal in redirection validation (CVE-2024-1132)
* unvalidated cross-origin messages in checkLoginIframe leads to DDoS (CVE-2024-1249)
* undertow: Out-of-memory Error after several closed connections with wildfly-http-client protocol (CVE-2024-1635)

This erratum releases a new image for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.8 for
use within the OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, OpenShift Container Platform
3.11, and within the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for on-premise or private cloud deployments, aligning with the standalone product release.

## Solution

To update to the latest Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.8 for OpenShift
image, Follow these steps to pull in the content:

1. On your main hosts, ensure you are logged into the CLI as a
cluster administrator or user with project administrator access
to the global "openshift" project. For example:

$ oc login -u system:admin

2. Update the core set of Red Hat Single Sign-On resources for OpenShift
in the "openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ for resource in sso76-image-stream.json \
sso76-https.json \
sso76-mysql.json \
sso76-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-postgresql.json \
sso76-postgresql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-https.json \
sso76-x509-mysql-persistent.json \
sso76-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.8.GA/templates/$](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/v7.6.8.GA/templates/%24){resource}
done

3. Install the Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.8 for OpenShift streams in the
"openshift" project by running the following commands:

$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-sso76-openshift:1.0
