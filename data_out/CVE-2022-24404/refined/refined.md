The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24404.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The lack of ciphertext authentication in the Air Interface Encryption (AIE) of the TETRA standard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Malleability of ciphertext**: Due to the absence of ciphertext authentication, an attacker can modify the encrypted messages without being detected. This allows for manipulation of transmitted data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Loss of authenticity**: Attackers can inject malicious messages, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Active attack:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the communication between TETRA devices.
*   **Air interface:** The attack targets the radio communication between the devices (Air Interface).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Active attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify TETRA traffic.
*   **Proximity to the TETRA network:** The attacker needs to be within range to intercept and manipulate radio signals.
