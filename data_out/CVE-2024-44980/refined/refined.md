Based on the provided content, both code changes address the same vulnerability, which is a memory leak in the `xe` display driver related to the opregion.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the `intel_opregion_setup` function within the `xe` (Intel Graphics) display driver. This function allocates memory for the opregion but doesn't always properly clean it up if the initialization fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory Leak: The code fails to free the allocated memory for the opregion when `intel_display_driver_probe_noirq` returns an error. This results in a memory leak if the display initialization fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion over time, potentially leading to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during device driver loading, specifically when the `xe` display driver is initialized. It can be triggered by failing the device probe during `modprobe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trigger a failure in `intel_display_driver_probe_noirq` or cause the driver to fail initialization. This could possibly be achieved via manipulating hardware/firmware, or by providing invalid configuration.
