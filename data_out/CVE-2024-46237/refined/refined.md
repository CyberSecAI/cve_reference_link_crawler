Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the PHPGurukul Hospital Management System. Specifically, the `patname`, `pataddress`, and `medhis` parameters in the `doctor/add-patient.php` and `doctor/edit-patient.php` files are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input, which is later rendered in other parts of the application, leading to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **User data compromise:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can steal user data.
*   **Account hijacking:** Malicious scripts can be used to hijack user accounts.
*   **Malware installation:** Attackers can use XSS to install malware on the user's machine.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `patname`, `pataddress`, and `medhis` parameters in the `doctor/add-patient.php` and `doctor/edit-patient.php` files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the application's patient management interface where they can add or edit patients. This implies having the necessary user role (doctor).
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script in any of the vulnerable fields.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested with the payload `<script>alert(1)</script>`, which successfully triggered an alert when viewing patient information in `doctor/manage-patient.php`, `admin/manage-patient.php`, or `doctor/view-patient.php`.
* The provided screenshots clearly show the alert box triggered on different pages after the injection, thus confirming the vulnerability.
* The affected version is v4.0 of the PHPGurukul Hospital Management System
