Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fix in version 3.7.3 of the "wp-ultimate-csv-importer" plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message for version 3.7.3 mentions "Vulnarablility security issue fix."  The changes in the javascript file (`js/ultimate-importer-free.js`) and the inclusion of a nonce key suggest a vulnerability related to insecure data handling or lack of proper validation. The primary change of concern is the addition of `&wpnonce=` parameters to AJAX requests. This indicates that a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability might have been present in previous versions of the plugin. This also indicates that a lack of nonce verification on the readfile.php.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **CSRF vulnerability:** The javascript changes indicate that the AJAX requests were lacking nonce verification. This would have allowed an attacker to potentially forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Lack of input validation on readfile.php:** By including the nonce, the plugin has introduced protection against CSRF. The specific vulnerability would have been located in the `readfile.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions in the plugin as an administrator. This could potentially include importing malicious CSV files, deleting content or other administrative actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious web page containing a form or javascript that makes a request to the vulnerable endpoint (`readfile.php`) with missing or invalid nonce parameter.
- An unsuspecting authenticated user would then have to visit this malicious page. If the user has an active authenticated session on the vulnerable site, the malicious request would be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be external to the application.
- The attacker would need to know the specific URLs or parameters of the vulnerable endpoints in the `readfile.php` file.
- The attacker would need to trick an authenticated user to visit a malicious webpage or click a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

- The `js/ultimate-importer-free.js` file shows several instances where the `wpnonce` parameter has been added to AJAX requests. This was also added to readfile.php.
- The `includes/WPImporter_includes_helper.php` file has the addition of a function `create_nonce_key()` suggesting that this function was called to add the nonce to the page or request.
- The Readme.txt also mentions a security issue fix.
- The commit description references the 3.7.3 version as a "Vulnarablility fix".

In summary, the changes made in version 3.7.3 of the plugin indicate that the vulnerability was related to CSRF, possibly exploitable through AJAX requests within the `readfile.php` file. The fix primarily addresses this by implementing nonce verification in the requests.
