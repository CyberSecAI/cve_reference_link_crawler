<p>To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification.

The analysis runs on a weekly schedule and uses the most recent version of CodeQL. When configuring code scanning, the fixed time for the weekly scan is randomly chosen. The scan will take place at the same time every week, and the schedule is displayed after the setup is completed, so users can easily see when the next scheduled analysis will occur. The scheduled analysis will be automatically disabled if a repository has no activity for six months.

Lombok features will now be automatically scanned without requiring any workaround.\n\nFor more information about syncing the required GitHub Actions workflow to scan Lombok code, see \"[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions).\"\n","Push protection for secret scanning is now generally available. For more information, see \"[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning).\"\n","To prevent the leak of tokens where users work outside of code, secret scanning detects tokens in both new and historical issue titles, descriptions, and comments. When a new token type is added to secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server scans for matches automatically. This expanded coverage also detects and surfaces secrets that match any custom pattern defined at the repository, organization, or enterprise level.

To help GitHub Support troubleshoot and debug, support bundles include a log containing these commands.\n","To simplify the discovery of events within enterprise, organization, or user audit logs, the search bar now displays a list of available filters.\n","Before a site administrator can migrate away from GitHub Enterprise Server using the [GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI](https://github.com/github/gh-gei), the [startRepositoryMigration](/graphql/reference/mutations#startrepositorymigration) GraphQL API, or the [Start an organization migration](/rest/migrations/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#start-an-organization-migration) REST API, the administrator must use the Management Console to configure a blob storage provider for the storage of migration archives. Supported provides include Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Previously, blob storage was not required and could optionally be configured using `gh gei`. This change adds support for migrations where the Git source or metadata is larger than 1 GB.\n","To help users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license better understand detected secrets and take action, secret scanning alerts concerning third-party API keys now include a link to the provider's documentation. For more information, see \"[About secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning).\"\n","Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license will now see the actions that users took on a secret scanning alert directly within the alert's timeline, including when a contributor bypassed push protection for a secret.\n","Instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license will regularly run a historical scan to detect newly added secret types on repositories with GitHub Advanced Security and secret scanning enabled. Previously, users needed to manually run a historical scan.\n","On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to ensure that future releases of GitHub Enterprise Server can always display a preview of a detected secret in the APIs or web UI, the detected secrets are now stored separately from source code. Detected secrets are stored using symmetric encryption. [Updated: 2023-02-15]\n","When using private registries for Dependabot updates, GitHub Enterprise Server behaves more securely. If a private registry is configured for any of the following ecosystems, the instance will no longer make any package requests to public registries.\n\n- Bundler\n- Docker\n- Gradle\n- Maven\n- npm\n- Nuget\n- Python\n- Yarn\n\nFor more information, see \"[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries).\"\n","Elixir developers who use [self-hosted Hex repositories](https://hex.pm/docs/self_hosting) can configure a private registry for Dependabot version updates on GitHub Enterprise Server.

When mentioning users, the Dependabot user account now appears as an autocomplete suggestion.\n","In repositories with vulnerable dependencies, Dependabot will no longer display a yellow banner. To notify contributors of vulnerable dependencies, the **Security** tab displays an alert counter.\n","If a user forks a repository with an existing Dependabot configuration in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot updates will be disabled in the fork by default. To enable updates in the fork, the user must visit the repository's code security and analysis settings. For more information, see \"[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates).\"\n","Integrators who wish to receive a webhook for Dependabot alerts must use the new `dependabot_alert` webhook. This webhook replaces the `repository_vulnerability_alert` webhook. For more information, see \"[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#dependabot_alert).\"\n","To improve readability of GitHub Actions workflows that reference other actions by commit SHA, action authors often write a comment including the corresponding semantic version on the line that calls the action. To save time, pull requests for Dependabot version updates will now automatically update the semantic version in these comments.\n","JavaScript developers who use Node.js, npm, and Dependabot security updates can save time when updating npm projects with transitive dependencies.\n\n- Dependabot can update both parent and child dependencies together. Previously, Dependabot would not update transitive dependencies when the parent required an incompatible specific version range, requiring manual upgrades.\n- Dependabot can create pull requests that resolve alerts where an update to a direct dependency would remove the vulnerable transitive dependency from the tree.\n\nFor more information, see \"[About Dependabot security updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).\"\n","For people who use Dependabot for version updates in the Docker ecosystem, Dependabot will proactively update Docker image tags in Kubernetes manifests.

Prior to this change, events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not create a new workflow run. For more information, see \"[Triggering a workflow](/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).\"\n","For scheduled runs of GitHub Actions workflows, users will see additional information about the repository, organization, and enterprise within the payload for `github.event`.\n","Users of GitHub Actions have better insight into the progress of a job when using environment protection rules. The `workflow_job` webhook supports a new `waiting` state whenever a job is awaiting an environment protection rule. Also, when a job refers to an `environment` key in its YAML definition, the `workflow_job` webhook payload will also include a new property, `deployment`. `deployment` contains metadata about the deployment that the check run created. For more information, see \"[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).\"\n","Organization owners can find more meaningful context within audit log events.\n\n- `business.sso_response` and `org.sso_response` events appear in the REST API and payloads for audit log streaming.\n- `repo.rename`, `project.rename`, and `protected_branch.update_name` events include the current and past names for these renamed within the `old_name` field.\n- Events for Dependabot alerts contain `alert_number`, `ghsa_id`, `dismiss_reason`, and `dismiss_comment` fields, in addition to a link back to the alert and an accurate timestamp.\n","Users can view a list that contains all of an organization's followers from the organization's profile.\n","The banner displayed atop an archived repository in the web UI now includes the repository's archival date.\n","The **Conversations** and **Files** tabs in pull requests now load more quickly due to deferred syntax highlighting.\n","To provide a more consistent experience between the web UI and users' workstations, and to speed up the process of checking whether users can merge a pull request automatically, GitHub Enterprise Server now uses the `merge-ort` strategy. For more information, see [Merge strategies](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-ort) in the Git documentation.\n","To improve the display of the initial comment in pull requests that contain one commit, GitHub Enterprise Server now automatically reformats detailed commit messages to adhere to GitHub's Markdown conventions.\n","Before squash-merging a pull request, the web UI displays the email address of the commit's author.
