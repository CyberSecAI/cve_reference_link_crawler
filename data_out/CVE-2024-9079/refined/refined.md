Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9079

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `marks.php` file of the "Student Record System" project. It occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `coursename` parameter, before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `coursename` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. This is a classic example of CWE-89.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or filter the user-provided `coursename` parameter, leading to the injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  Attackers can access and extract sensitive information.
    *   **Data Tampering:**  Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain full control of the system through the database.
    *   **Service Interruption:** Attackers may be able to disrupt the service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to `marks.php` including the malicious payload in the `coursename` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Authentication Required:** No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests and understand basic SQL injection concepts.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected File:** `marks.php`
*   **Affected Parameter:** `coursename` (POST parameter)
*   **Vulnerable Software:** code-projects Student Record System version 1.0
*   **Exploit Type:** Time-based blind SQL Injection.
*  **Proof of Concept (PoC) Payload:**
     ```
     Parameter: coursename (POST)
     Type: time-based blind
     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
     Payload: coursecode=ENGLISH 001&coursename=1' AND (SELECT 2118 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))lcSo) AND 'ebjJ'='ebjJ&seatlimit=1&submit=
     ```
*   The `sqlmap` tool was used to test the vulnerability
*   **Exploit Availability:** A public exploit is available (github.com).

**Recommendations:**

*   **Use Prepared Statements:** Implement prepared statements with parameter binding to separate SQL code from user data.
*   **Input Validation and Filtering:** Validate and filter all user inputs to ensure they meet the expected format.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict database user permissions to the minimum necessary for the application to function.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular code and system security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered critical, with a high CVSS score.
*   The vulnerability is easily exploitable and requires no authentication.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)
