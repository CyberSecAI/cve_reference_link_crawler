Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-38665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CollabNet Plugins Plugin stores a RabbitMQ password unencrypted in its global configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Sensitive information (RabbitMQ password) is stored in plain text within the `hudson.plugins.collabnet.share.TeamForgeShare.xml` file on the Jenkins controller.
- This constitutes an insecure storage of credentials vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the unencrypted RabbitMQ password.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the RabbitMQ server and potentially other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have legitimate or illegitimate access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in CollabNet Plugins Plugin versions 2.0.8 and earlier.
- Version 2.0.9 of the plugin removes the EventQ feature which accepts RabbitMQ credentials, thus preventing the vulnerability. Saving the configuration after updating to version 2.0.9 will remove the password from the configuration file.
- The severity is rated as "Low" with a CVSS score of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
