Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks in the `duplicate_thing()` function within the `Clone_Handler` class of the "Happy Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The `duplicate_thing()` function lacks proper checks to ensure only authorized users can clone posts. Specifically, it does not adequately verify if a user is allowed to clone private or password-protected posts.
*   The function `can_clone()` only checks for the `edit_posts` capability, which is not granular enough for the cloning action.
*   The function `is_the_same_author()` had a typo (`==~=`) which was fixed in the patch, but was not directly related to the vulnerability.
*   The function does check for 'private' or 'draft' posts but not password protected ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Attackers with contributor-level access or higher can exploit this vulnerability to clone any post, including private and password-protected ones. This can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
*   An attacker can gain access to the content of posts that they would not normally have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted request to the `admin_action_ha_duplicate_thing` hook, which triggers the `duplicate_thing()` function.
*   The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with "contributor" level access or higher.
*   The attacker can trigger the cloning action through the WordPress admin interface by clicking the "Happy Clone" link displayed in the post row actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account with at least contributor-level privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker can be a low-privileged user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `happy-elementor-addons/trunk/classes/clone-handler.php`.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 3.10.4.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.10.5. The patch adds more checks to prevent cloning of private and password protected posts by unauthorized users.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Lucio SÃ¡ from Wordfence.
