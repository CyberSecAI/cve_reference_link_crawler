Heiko SchÃ¤fer discovered a new security issue in the Yubico `yubihsm_pkcs11.so` driver library, which we disclosed together to Yubico. The YubiHSM PKCS#11 client-side library is designed to interact with Yubico HSM2 hardware security modules. Due to flaws in the memory handling, the library code accidentally returns 8192 bytes of previously used process memory under some circumstances. This impacts the memory confidentiality of the calling program for some usages.

This article will describe the issue.

## Memory Handling Issue in C\_GetAttributeValue

The `C_GetAttributeValue()` function in `yubihsm_pkcs11.c` can be used to query X.509 certificate attributes of particular types. However, some codepaths have problematic memory handling.

Consider client software that retrieves the certificate attribute `CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER` with the `C_GetAttributeValue` call from a regular, non-malicious YubiHSM2 device via the PKCS#11 API interface.

Internally, the PKCS#11 functions will establish a session with the YubiHSM2 device and then attempt to handle and parse the received object information.
This happens via the following code positions:

```
CK_DEFINE_FUNCTION(CK_RV, C_GetAttributeValue)[...]
```

[yubihsm\_pkcs11.c L2018](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.c#L2018)

```
CK_RV populate_template(int type, void *object, CK_ATTRIBUTE_PTR pTemplate, [..])
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L5065](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L5065)

Note that `populate_template()` reserves a local stack buffer `CK_BYTE tmp[8192];` without explicit data initialization and passes its size as the `len` parameter to subsequent function calls in

```
CK_ULONG len = sizeof(tmp);
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L5072](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L5072)
This will become relevant later.

The particular security issue is associated with opaque attributes, which are handled via

```
static CK_RV get_attribute([...])
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L1969](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L1969)

```
static CK_RV get_attribute_opaque(CK_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE type, [...] )
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L1030](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L1030)

In `get_attribute_opaque()`, some function paths overwrite the `length` parameter - which is passed as a reference - to the actual length of the field for the specific attribute they fetched. However, for at least three specific field types, this does not happen:

```
   case CKA_SUBJECT:
   case CKA_ISSUER:
   case CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER:
break;
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L1105-L1108](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L1105-L1108)

As a result, code flows hitting the quoted code lines in `get_attribute_opaque()` will return to the parent function *without* writing data into the `tmp` buffer, *without* changing the `length` parameter away from the maximum value, and *without* returning an error code. By convention, this appears like a successful operation which produced 8192 bytes of new output, although in reality the `tmp` buffer was not written to at all.

This constellation leads to a problematic `memcpy()` call which leaks the uninitialized memory contents of `tmp` into the output:

```
memcpy(pTemplate[i].pValue, tmp, len);
```

[util\_pkcs11.c L5095](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/blob/91ac2c7e04ef6a6a1ec91b8a58efd1489ff02e63/pkcs11/util_pkcs11.c#L5095)

Typically, the content of uninitialized stack memory variables will contain memory from stack frames which previously occupied the relevant memory region. Copying data from this memory region will likely contain stack variables and other stack-related information (stack canaries, pointers) from previous function calls.

The leaked data will then get returned to the PKCS#11 caller. Since the caller requested some specific certificate information, but instead gets data from an information leak, this represents a security issue. Additionally, since the problematic library function indicates no errors, this information may be passed on by the caller towards other components and trust spheres, depending on the specific behavior of the program.

Programs that use the YubiHSM are likely to handle secrets, possibly including secret key material, or sensitive plaintext. The sensitive key material may include the PIN secret used to secure the HSM communication. Because of this bug, a program that uses `yubihsm_pkcs11.so` may inadvertently return such information instead of the requested X.509 certificate attributes.

Since the vulnerable component is a flexible library, it is unclear which programs call into the problematic function, and under which circumstances. Additionally, the relevant memory accesses are undefined behavior (UB) in C and may depend on the compiler and system environment. If you have more information about specific integrating applications and their confirmed security impacts, please contact us.

### Initial Debugging

To confirm that this data actually leaks from the tmp variable on the stack, we used a modified `yubihsm_pkcs11.so` library which specifically marks the memory in question with ASCII âAâ characters. During initial debugging, this allowed a straightforward identification of the problematic memory in returned data:

```
CK_BYTE tmp[8192];
+ // mark potentially leaked bytes
+ memset(tmp, 0x41, sizeof(tmp));
```
### PoC

In order to confirm the issue and help Yubico reproduce it, we crafted a proof-of-concept (PoC). The PoC consists of a short dummy program written in C that triggers the issue: [pkcs11-memleak.c](/assets/artifacts/cve-2023-39908/pkcs11-memleak.c).

**WARNING: use the provided PoC code at your own risk, and only on non-production HSM devices.**

Please see the code comments for setup details and explanations. The special `put_dummy_secrets_on_stack()` function may be of particular interest to understand the leaked output and attack conditions.

### Code History

*Note: this section has been updated to include new information.*

By our understanding, this issue was introduced via a combination of two commits:

1. [This](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/commit/c5723d17cd50081f641da21210942cdc76387673) commit on Sep 8, 2020 (released with version `2.0.3`)
2. [This](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/commit/96732186c970eb6d426f0fa22d4dc81470fd6476#diff-fa4816e3d6c18558a759b602826c3b5345b3d3d3393d95b89357bacdfa231fffR1042-R1046) commit merged on Jan 1, 2023 (released with version `2.4.0`)

Commit 1) introduces the weak `tmp` buffer initialization, and commit 2) introduces problematic code paths and makes the issue reachable.

### Patch

The main patch improves the problematic code paths in `get_attribute_opaque()`:

```
    case CKA_SUBJECT:
    case CKA_ISSUER:
    case CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER:
+      *((CK_BYTE_PTR *) value) = NULL;
+      *length = 0;
      break;
```

A second patch improves the buffer initialization:

```
-  CK_BYTE tmp[8192];
+  CK_BYTE tmp[8192] = {0};
```

[util\_pkcs11.c R5179](https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell/commit/a393ea37ec91df7bb6ed1d70330da8700c45a57d#diff-fa4816e3d6c18558a759b602826c3b5345b3d3d3393d95b89357bacdfa231fffR5179)

### Security Implications

#### CVSS Score

The described security issue affects the confidentiality of program memory. Due to the characteristics of the flaw, we think that program memory integrity and program availability is not impacted.

As with other memory- and library-related vulnerabilities, it is difficult to say generally what the sensitive information in memory is going to be, and how the leaked information will be processed or exposed by the caller. As a result, the practical worst-case impact will likely be very target-dependent.

| ID | CVSS 3.1 Score | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2023-39908 stack information leak | **4.4** (Medium) | [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1) |

The listed scoring maps the impact on a network-enabled integrating program which allows a remote user to trigger the affected functionality and obtain secrets after some form of authentication as a high-privileged user. Other integrating programs that use the PKCS#11 driver may have different impacts. For example, if a lower-privileged user can trigger the issue, `PR: L` would turn this into a **5.3** CVSS base score ([calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)).

## Coordinated Disclosure

As outlined in the [timeline](#timeline), the first ~60 days out of the overall 90 days of disclosure did not see a lot of activity or feedback from the vendor side. This follows a pattern seen with previous coordinated disclosures to Yubico, which also had significant delays between reporting and technical discussion & assessment coordination with the vendor. We recommend focusing on a quicker initial handling for future disclosures to reduce the time pressure on coordination tasks.
We want to positively mention that Yubico has provided security patches and an advisory on the disclosure date for this disclosure, which is an improvement over the previous issue.
