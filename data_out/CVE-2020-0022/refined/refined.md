Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-0022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the Android Bluetooth subsystem during the reassembly of fragmented HCI ACL (Asynchronous Connectionless Link) packets. This incorrect bounds calculation leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A calculation error occurs when handling fragmented Bluetooth packets, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write:**  The overflow allows writing data past the allocated buffer for the Bluetooth packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the vulnerable device.
*   **No Additional Privileges Needed:** The exploit does not require any additional execution privileges on the target device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Bluetooth:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted Bluetooth transmissions. Specifically, fragmented GAP (Generic Access Profile) ACL L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) data sent over HCI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the victim's device.
*   **Bluetooth MAC Address:** The attacker needs to know the Bluetooth MAC address of the target device.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious Bluetooth packets to trigger the integer overflow and out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Google.
*   Huawei has released patches for several smartphone models affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was also referred to as "BlueFrag".
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with the following commit: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/+/3cb7149d8fed2d7d77ceaa95bf845224c4db3baf`

**CVSS v3 Score:**
*   Base Score: 8.8 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   Temporal Score: 8.2 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
