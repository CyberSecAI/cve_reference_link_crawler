Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `vmsvgaR3FifoUpdateCursor` function in Oracle VirtualBox. This lack of validation allows for a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which means the software attempts to access memory outside of the intended buffer, leading to a potential information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to disclose sensitive information present within the memory space of the guest operating system.
- **Code Execution (with other vulns):** This vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve code execution within the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local attackers, meaning the attacker must have some form of access or ability to execute code on the guest system where the vulnerable software is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported to Oracle on March 3, 2020, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on April 16, 2020.
- Oracle has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.2 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a low impact in terms of confidentiality and no impact in terms of integrity or availability. However, the vulnerability does have a scope change (S:C).
- The vulnerability was discovered by anhdaden & Calvin Fong (Lord\_Idiot) of STAR Labs, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The issue is located within the vmsvgaR3FifoUpdateCursor function.
