  "CVE-2024-9675": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.",
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in Buildah's cache mount functionality. The application does not properly validate if the user-specified path for the cache is within the designated cache directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Arbitrary directory mount"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can mount an arbitrary host directory into a container with read and write permissions, potentially gaining access to sensitive files, performing malicious actions, or causing other issues on the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": "By creating a malicious Containerfile, the attacker can leverage the `--mount type=cache,id=...` option within a `RUN` instruction to specify an arbitrary path on the host system. This path will then be mounted into the container.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a Containerfile and run the build process using buildah or podman with access to the targeted host. The user running buildah/podman must have the appropriate file access rights on the targeted host system for the exploit to succeed."
