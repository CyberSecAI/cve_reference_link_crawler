| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2317458#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-09 02:49:15 UTC  ``` Cache mounts (`--mount type=cache,id=...`) in Buildah and `podman build` do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Containerfile to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah. This codepath automatically performs an SELinux relabel on the directory in question to ensure the build has access to it, so SELinux does not stop this.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2317458#c4)
