- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in FortiManager's management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284) allows unauthorized actions across different ADOMs. Specifically, the vulnerability allows a user with device management permissions in one ADOM to add and delete CLI scripts in other ADOMs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands by adding and deleting CLI scripts in ADOMs they should not have access to. This could lead to significant disruptions or unauthorized changes to the managed devices.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through the FortiManager management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with at least "device management" permission on their profile within a specific ADOM.
