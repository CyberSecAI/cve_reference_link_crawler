- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from two regular expressions (`pattern` and `markdownPattern`) within `MathJax.js` which are susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the use of complex and potentially exponential regular expressions. These expressions can be forced into long processing times when provided with specially crafted input strings, leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could cause a denial-of-service condition by consuming excessive CPU resources, making the application unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to control the messages passed into `MathJax.Message.Set()` or `MathJax.Localization._()`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the input strings supplied to the vulnerable functions. Although the maintainers state that these functions are not user-facing, if an attacker can control the input, this can still lead to an attack.
