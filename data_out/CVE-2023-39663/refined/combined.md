| **Replace the text below with the details of the issue you are facing. DO NOT simply erase the form and type a free-form response.**Issue Summary MathJax v2 contains two highly vulnerable regex patterns in `MathJax.js`: `pattern` and `markdownPattern`. `pattern`: `/%(\d+|\{\d+\}|\{[a-z]+:\%\d+(?:\|(?:%\{\d+\}|%.|[^\}])*)+\}|.)/` `markdownPattern`: `/(%.)|(\*{1,3})((?:%.|.)+?)\2|(`+)((?:%.|.)+?)\4|\[((?:%.|.)+?)\]\(([^\s\)]+)\)/`  These regex patterns are susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. If an attacker can control the message passed into `MathJax.Message.Set()` or `MathJax.Localization._()`, it could potentially trigger a ReDoS attack. Steps to Reproduce:  1. use `MathJax.Message.Set(["msg","%{a:%0||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",5]);`    or `MathJax.Localization._("123", "%{a:%0||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||");`   With [recheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recheck), these two patterns are consider to be exponential ReDos. Technical details:  * MathJax Version: <=2.7.9 * Client OS: Mac OS X 12.1 * Browser: Edge 115.0.1901.183   I am using the following MathJax configuration:  ``` MathJax.Hub.Config({          tex2jax: {              inlineMath: [["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],              displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"]]          } }); ```  and loading MathJax via  ``` <script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@2/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML-full"></script> ``` Supporting information:  * Please supply a link to a (live) minimal example page, when possible. * If your issue is with the display of the mathematics produced by MathJax, include a screen snapshot that illustrates the problem, when possible. * Check your browser console window for any error messages, and include them here. * Include the MathJax configuration you are using, and the script tag that loads MathJax itself. |

### **[dpvc](/dpvc)** commented [Jul 31, 2023](#issuecomment-1658291365)

| Thank you for your report. We appreciate your interest in making MathJax better.  These regular expressions would be a concern if they were applied to user-supplied strings, but they are only applied to MathJax-supplied strings, and those strings don't include the troublesome situations like the ones you are suggesting. Users can't call these functions directly (and if they could, you would have much bigger problems than this).  So while these patterns do include the potential for the denial of service you are suggesting, the situations that would cause that are not present in their usage in MathJax. |
