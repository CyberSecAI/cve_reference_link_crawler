- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a hardcoded cryptographic key within the IBM Maximo Application Suite - Monitor Component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hardcoded cryptographic keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The security bulletin does not specify the exact impact, but the use of hardcoded keys can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security compromises.
- **Attack vectors**: The bulletin does not detail specific attack vectors, but an attacker could potentially exploit this weakness through access to the vulnerable component and use the hardcoded key for malicious purposes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The bulletin does not specify the exact attacker capabilities/position, however, the attacker would require knowledge of the location of the hardcoded key.
