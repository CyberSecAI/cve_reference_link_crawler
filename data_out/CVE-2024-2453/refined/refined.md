- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Specifically, a SQL Injection vulnerability exists in Advantech's WebAccess/SCADA software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated attacker to read or modify data on the remote database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WebAccess/SCADA application. The attack complexity is low. Public exploits are available.
