| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2024-05-02 12:25:37 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Wildlfly management interface where there is no sockets limits to perform connections to http management interface. This may lead occasionally to a Denial of Service (DoS) for Wildfly server after nofile limit reaches its maximum. This requires normally local access as the management interface is not exposed by default and it is not a common configuration to make it public.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-14 17:59:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:8077 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8077](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8077)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-14 17:59:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:8076 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8076](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8076)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-14 18:00:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2024:8075 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8075](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8075)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-10-14 18:07:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:8080 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8080](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8080)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-04 20:11:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:8824 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8824](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8824)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-04 20:12:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2024:8823 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8823](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8823)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2278615#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-04 20:56:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2024:8826 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8826](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8826)   ``` |  |
