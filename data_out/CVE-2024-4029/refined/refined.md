{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-4029",
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in Wildfly's management interface. Due to the lack of socket limitation for the management interface, it may be possible to cause a denial of service by hitting the nofile limit, as there is no way to configure or set a maximum number of connections.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the absence of a mechanism to limit the number of socket connections to the Wildfly management interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of socket connection limits on management interface."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) of the Wildfly server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connections to the management interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the Wildfly management interface. While the management interface is not exposed by default, if a misconfiguration exposes the interface, a remote attacker could exploit it.",
        "additional_details": "The management interface does not implement a timeout mechanism for connection requests, allowing an attacker to exhaust system resources."
