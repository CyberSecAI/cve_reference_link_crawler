{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The security scan function in `src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php` contains a flawed XML encoding check in the `toUtf8` function. It uses a regex to identify the XML encoding, which can be bypassed by inserting whitespace before or after the `=` in the `encoding` attribute, causing it to default to UTF-8 and bypass the intended security checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation of XML encoding",
    "XXE vulnerability due to insecure XML parsing"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Sensitive information disclosure by reading server files through crafted XLSX files. This can be escalated through the PHP filter wrapper to read server files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a crafted XLSX file to a server that uses PHPSpreadsheet to parse the document.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious XLSX file to a server that uses a vulnerable version of PHPSpreadsheet. No special privileges are required."
