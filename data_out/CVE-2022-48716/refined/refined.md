Based on the provided information, all three commits address the same vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of channel IDs in the `wcd938x` audio codec driver. The mixer controls were using the channel ID directly from `mixer->reg` as a port ID, but the port ID should have been derived from the `chan_info` array. This caused the driver to potentially access the `port_map` array out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** Using the channel ID as a port ID could lead to accessing memory outside the allocated range for the `port_map` array.
- **Data corruption:** Corrupting the `wcd938x_sdw_priv` structure due to out-of-bounds writes, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption.
- Unpredictable driver behavior and potential system instability

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating mixer controls to trigger the incorrect port ID usage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the audio mixer controls of a system utilizing the affected wcd938x driver.

**Technical Details**
The core issue lies within the `wcd938x_connect_port` function and how it was previously called in `wcd938x_set_compander` and `wcd938x_set_swr_port`:

*   **Incorrect usage:** Previously, `wcd938x_connect_port` was called using `mc->reg` (channel ID) directly as the port ID.
*   **Corrected usage:** The fix involves retrieving the correct port ID from `wcd->ch_info[mc->reg].port_num` and using that when accessing the `port_config` array and passing the correct `port_num` to the `wcd938x_connect_port` function. The function signature of the `wcd938x_connect_port` also changed to accept `port_num` as well as `ch_id`

The fix ensures that the correct port ID is used to access the `port_config` array, preventing out-of-bounds access.
