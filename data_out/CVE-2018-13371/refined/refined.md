- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An external control of system vulnerability in FortiOS allows a regular authenticated user to change the routing settings of the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists due to insufficient access control to the ZebOS component, allowing unauthorized manipulation of routing settings by unprivileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could lead to the execution of unauthorized code or commands. Attackers can potentially alter network traffic routing, leading to denial of service, data interception, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated, regular user connecting to the ZebOS component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the FortiOS system, implying they need to be an authenticated user.
