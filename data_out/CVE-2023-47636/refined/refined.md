Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of error handling within the `fopen()` function when exporting data, specifically when the temporary export file does not exist on the server. This causes the server to respond with an error message that includes the full path of the file, thereby revealing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Full Path Disclosure (FPD): The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the server's file system path due to the lack of proper error handling when a file is not found.
- Inadequate Error Handling: The application doesn't gracefully handle cases where the expected temporary export file isn't present, leading to the disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: Attackers can obtain the full path of the webroot/file on the server, which can be used to further exploit the system by leveraging other vulnerabilities requiring file path information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the data export functionality. Specifically, triggering the data export process when a temporary export file does not exist will generate the error message including the full path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a data export process that attempts to access a non-existent temporary file. This likely requires an authenticated user with access to the export functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` component.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.1 of the package.
- The provided commit `10d178ef771097604a256c1192b098af9ec57a87` contains the necessary changes to address this issue, specifically adding error handling.
- The huntr.com link confirms this vulnerability, and the vulnerability is classified as moderate.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-209 (Information Exposure Through an Error Message).
