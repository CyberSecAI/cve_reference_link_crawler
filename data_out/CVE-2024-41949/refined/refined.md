{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how third-party blocks are generated in the biscuit-auth library. A malicious user can manipulate the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` by altering the `publicKeys` field. This allows them to trick the third-party authority into generating a datalog rule that trusts a different keypair than intended, effectively bypassing the intended third-party authorization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or integrity checks on the `publicKeys` field within the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest`. The third party authority blindly trusts the provided public keys, enabling a malicious user to substitute them with their own.",
       "Incorrect handling of public keys in token symbol tables during third-party block generation."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass third-party authorization. Specifically, tokens that should require third-party blocks from specific authorities can be used without obtaining the actual third-party block from the correct authority. This compromises the intended access control mechanism and can potentially allow unauthorized access to resources.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is network-based. A malicious user crafts a manipulated `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` which is then sent to the third-party authority.",
     "The attack vector includes modifying the symbol table in a third-party request"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to forge or modify `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` messages. This likely requires the attacker to have some control over the token or be able to intercept and manipulate the requests. The attacker must also have the ability to generate a new keypair.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to how the biscuit-auth library handles third-party blocks. The intended flow involves a holder of a token requesting a third-party block from a third-party authority. This request should only be possible if the holder had access to the token. However, by manipulating the request, the holder may bypass a required authorization. "
