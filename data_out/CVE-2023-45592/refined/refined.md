- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The embedded Chromium browser is executed with the "--no-sandbox" option and with root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-250 "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges". The browser, due to being run without a sandbox and as root, has elevated privileges. This exacerbates the impact of any browser vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is variable and dependent on the exploited vulnerability in the browser. However, because the browser is running with root privileges, an attacker may gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is physical (AV:P), this implies that the attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable device in order to exploit this issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device running the vulnerable software. The attacker does not require any special privileges or UI interaction to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N/UI:N).
