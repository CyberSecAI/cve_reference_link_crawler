Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-21981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper key usage control within the AMD Secure Processor (ASP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient control over how cryptographic keys are used within the ASP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has already gained arbitrary code execution privileges within the ASP can extract ASP cryptographic keys.
- This key extraction could lead to:
    - Loss of confidentiality (sensitive data protected by those keys could be exposed).
    - Loss of integrity (the attacker could potentially use the keys to forge signatures or otherwise tamper with systems relying on the compromised keys).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker needs to have already achieved arbitrary code execution privilege in the ASP. This suggests that this vulnerability is a secondary exploit, requiring a previous exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Prior arbitrary code execution within the ASP.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document explicitly mentions this vulnerability requires a separate, already fixed ASP firmware vulnerability to be exploited, so an attacker would first need to achieve code execution within ASP using a different vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS score of 5.7.
- There is no fix planned for this vulnerability in the provided mitigation information for EPYC processors.
- The vulnerability is acknowledged to have been reported by Hugo Magalhaes, Oracle Security Researcher.
