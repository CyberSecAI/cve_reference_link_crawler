Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue in the "Simple Custom Post Order" WordPress plugin. This indicates that there is a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the absence of necessary access controls, allowing unprivileged users to potentially execute higher-privileged actions. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as **low severity**, and the vulnerability is considered "unlikely to be exploited."
*   The specific impact is not detailed but it is stated that it "varies case by case." It could lead to unauthorized modification or access to data or functionality that a user should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access controls by a user who is not authorized to perform certain actions. The specific function is not named

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a **subscriber** level user. This indicates that a low-privileged user, not necessarily an administrator, could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
