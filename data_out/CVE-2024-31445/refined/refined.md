Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `automation_get_new_graphs_sql` function within the `api_automation.php` file. Specifically, the `get_request_var('filter')` is concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to unsanitized user input being used in an SQL query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `filter` parameter, retrieved via `get_request_var()`, does not undergo any filtering or sanitization before being used in SQL queries

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users can exploit the SQL injection to potentially elevate their privileges within the Cacti system.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The SQL injection can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious SQL queries that can then be used to manipulate the operating system on which cacti is hosted.
- **Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack could also be used to potentially steal or manipulate database information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a network connection.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious request to the `automation_graph_rules.php` page by sending a crafted filter parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cacti application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cacti server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `build_graph_object_sql_having` function called within the  `automation_get_new_graphs_sql` function, using the filter provided via the get_request_var function.
- The vulnerable code is present in Cacti versions 1.2.26 and earlier.
- The fix is implemented in Cacti version 1.2.27.
- The `filter` parameter uses `FILTER_DEFAULT`, which performs no filtering.

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by injecting a sleep command into the SQL query via the filter parameter.

The CVSS score is 8.8/10, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
