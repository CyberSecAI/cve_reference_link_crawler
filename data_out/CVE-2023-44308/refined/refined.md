- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An open redirect vulnerability exists in the adaptive media administration page of Liferay DXP due to insufficient validation of the `_com_liferay_adaptive_media_web_portlet_AMPortlet_redirect` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect. The application fails to properly validate user-controlled input (the redirect parameter) before using it in a redirect.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by a user, redirects the user to an arbitrary external website. This can be used for phishing attacks or to trick users into visiting malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable `_com_liferay_adaptive_media_web_portlet_AMPortlet_redirect` parameter by crafting a malicious URL. The user must then be tricked into clicking the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious URLs. No special privileges are required on the Liferay system. The user needs to click on a malicious URL.
