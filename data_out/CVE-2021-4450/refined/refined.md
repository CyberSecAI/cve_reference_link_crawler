Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4450

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied data within SQL queries when duplicating a post's metadata. Specifically, the `addslashes()` function was used for escaping, which is insufficient to prevent SQL Injection, especially when dealing with post meta data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Unsanitized user input (post metadata) is directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code relies on `addslashes()` for escaping, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:**  The vulnerable code directly builds the SQL query by concatenating strings, instead of using prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** It could be used to modify data or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands (although the blind nature limits this somewhat).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** Exploitation is performed through HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Authenticated:** Attackers need to be logged in to the WordPress site, specifically with a "Contributor" role or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Account:** Attackers need a WordPress user account with at least contributor-level permissions.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Understanding SQL and injection techniques is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `duplicate-post.php` file of the Post Grid plugin, specifically in how it handles post metadata when duplicating posts.
*   The vulnerable versions are those prior to version 2.1.13.
*   The fix implemented in version 2.1.13 addresses the SQL injection vulnerability. It replaces the vulnerable code with calls to WordPress functions `get_post_custom()` and `add_post_meta()` which properly handle sanitization.
