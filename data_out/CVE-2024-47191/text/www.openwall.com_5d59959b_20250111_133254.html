Hi,

Great work by the SUSE Security Team and upstream!

This link requires authentication.  I guess you meant to post:

I note a few things:

1. Neither the SUSE nor the upstream patches change the supplementary
groups.  SUSE patches fork() and then in the child setgid() and
setuid().  Upstream doesn't fork(), but switches with setegid() and
seteuid(), and then back.  If the intent is solely to avoid the need for
fchown(), then that's sufficient.  Hopefully, along with SUSE's openat()
and flags magic or with upstream's fopen(, "x"), nothing more is needed.
However, if the intent is to avoid even trying to access files in user's
directory with potentially excessive privileges, then supplementary
groups should also be switched or dropped.

I'm sorry I didn't get around to bringing this maybe-issue up in the
pre-disclosure thread on the distros list (which Johannes Segitz from
SUSE kindly started on September 27).  I feel it was not essential to
discuss/address pre-disclosure, and is fine to discuss in public now.

2. Switching task credentials from library code is tricky, given that
the program could have threads that don't expect this.  set*id() and
setgroups() libc calls would typically affect all threads.  On Linux,
it's possible to affect the current thread only, which e.g. we do in
tcb[1] by using setfs*id() and direct setgroups() syscall (the latter
only in our recent git code at this time, previously we used the libc
function).  I assume Simon is aware of the Linux specific way, but
deliberately chose not to do this in upstream oath-toolkit for
portability to non-Linux.

[1] <https://www.openwall.com/tcb/> and <https://github.com/openwall/tcb>

3. There's similar concern about the program's signal handlers, which
isn't addressed by switching credentials only of the current thread.
Maybe such library code should be temporarily blocking signals?  This
becomes tricky and dirty.  In tcb, we just accept this risk for now
(that a signal handler may run with unexpectedly dropped privileges).

4. As Simon also noted:

I agree fork() from library code is tricky, but not so much because of
portability concerns.  Again, the program using the library may not
expect it to ever have an extra child process.  Sure the library should
use waitpid() on this specific process, yet the program could receive
unexpected SIGCHLD.  The combination of the program's threads and our
fork() could also have unexpected consequences.

In tcb, we chose to make usage of fork() a PAM module option, so that by
enabling it the distro or sysadmin acknowledges that it's acceptable in
the specific PAM configuration.  Our usage of fork() is for a different
reason, though: "Using this option one can be sure that after a call to
pam_end(3) there is no sensitive data left in the process' address
space."  I wonder if this property would also be relevant in
oath-toolkit patches if more processing is moved to the child process,
or if this would be excessive under the relevant threat models.
