Looks good to me.

There's a subtle issue here - another user's (or root's) temporary file
may be hard-linked and st_nlink may be back to 1 after the file is
unlinked by its original creator/user.  For example, tmpfile(3) unlinks
the file right away, yet the calling program is expected to proceed to
use it.  In that case, an attacker winning the race could manipulate
content of another user's temporary file, which that user's program
could then read back and use.

Right.

Right.  It appears that given your decision to allow any file owner, you
cannot fully prevent hard link attacks without protected_hardlinks.

Oh, I had thought you'd only be able to reliably post-check for regular
file, which would be too late against side-effects on open().  However,
now I realize that you first open with O_PATH, which presumably avoids
side-effects(*), then check fstat(), and only then if everything looks
good you reopen via /proc/self/fd/fd for actual usage.  That's quite a
hack, but yes, O_NOCTTY on reopen should be redundant.

(*) The man page says "Opening a file or directory with the O_PATH flag
requires no permissions on the object itself", so we'd have bigger
problems regardless of your usage if there were side-effects.

OK, this makes sense.
