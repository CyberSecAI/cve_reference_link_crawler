As I understand, the SUSE patch already does that.

The detail here may be different.  And importantly, the final path
component must be owned strictly by the target user (not by root, unless
the target user is root).

Both the SUSE and the upstream patch try to do two things at once: drop
privileges and access files safer.  Maybe I missed, but I think neither
of you specified whether these two things are intended as required
complementary parts (and what attacks would work if only one part worked
as intended) or as defense-in-depth.  You could want to clarify this.

Thanks.

I guess it's checks of st_uid and st_nlink?  There are still some really
subtle issues like side effects on open() of a device file, which can be
hard linked too, but privilege dropping should mostly prevent them.  I'd
also add O_NOCTTY.

Yes, I am well aware of that, which is why I primarily mentioned other
exposures.  Linux's "dumpable" also affects much of /proc, but does not
affect e.g. kill() and setpriority().  And I was speaking in general,
not only about your patch, so not only about Linux.

Yes, that's a trade-off.
