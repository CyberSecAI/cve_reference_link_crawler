This currently switches fsuid/fsgid (so for the current thread only),
but uses initgroups() and setgroups() libc functions (so affects all
threads).  Code last modified 4 years ago, which pre-dates our
recognition of the supplementary groups vs. threads problem and its fix
in tcb.  Maybe Linux-PAM should implement a similar change now.

This currently switches euid/egid/groups, so doesn't try to be MT-safe.

(On Linux, it is also possible to switch euid/egid via direct syscalls
for the current thread only, but there's no point because switching of
fsuid/fsgid is more appropriate for this purpose anyway.)

A couple of nitpicks on your upstream oath-toolkit code:

1. You restore egid/euid in this same order as you set them.  This
unnecessarily introduces an extra temporary state.  I suggest that you
restore them in reverse order, so set egid/euid ... restore euid/egid.
(The SUSE patch doesn't have this "problem".)

2. After uses of asprintf() you first check the pointer for NULL and
only then check the return value.  Strictly speaking, this is undefined
behavior because the pointer may be uninitialized if the return value
indicates an error.  Of course, this shouldn't matter in practice unless
a compiler is aware and deliberately exploits the UB (e.g. optimize
everything out because this is UB anyway) or the environment (hardware
or a software "sanitizer") is such that uninitialized reads are trapped,
but to make it correct I suggest that you simply drop the NULL checks.

Thank you for bringing this up.

I think that for reasonable configurations in absence of attacks this
difference is unimportant, however there are different risks involved.

In particular, I worry that the SUSE approach could be susceptible to
hard link attacks (when the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl is not set).
Would this allow to overwrite someone else's file (the original issue)
if the user can hard link that file?  I currently don't see why not, so
it's probably a vulnerability.

Would it allow to have the log in process temporarily switch to another
user (of the attacker's choosing)?  This sounds relatively minor.

In general, switching to a user not only drops privileges for file
access, but also potentially exposes the process as that user's.
fsuid/fsgid switching is the safest in this respect (these were meant
just for file access purposes), but with other IDs (depending on which)
there may be extra exposure of the partially privileged log in process
to the user via /proc, kill(), setpriority(), etc. ... but thankfully
and hopefully not also via ptrace() on modern systems anymore.
