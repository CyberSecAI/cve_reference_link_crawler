Subject: CVE-2024-47191: Local root exploit in the PAM module pam_oath.so

Hello list,

this is a report about a local root exploit in the PAM module `pam_oath.so`,
which is shipped as part of the oath-toolkit project [1].

You can also find a rendered HTML version of this report on our blog [5].

The vulnerability was discovered by Fabian Vogt of SUSE, and this report and
attached patch were authored by Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE Security Team.

Introduction
============

oath-toolkit[1] contains libraries and utilities for managing one-time password
(OTP) authentication e.g. as a second factor to password authentication.
Fellow SUSE engineer Fabian Vogt approached our Security Team about the
project's PAM module. A couple of years ago, the module gained a feature which
allows to place the OTP state file (called usersfile) in the home directory of
the to-be-authenticated user. Fabian noticed that the PAM module performs
unsafe file operations in users' home directories. Since PAM stacks typically
run as root, this can easily cause security issues.

The feature in question has been introduced in oath-toolkit version 2.6.7 (via
commit 60d9902b5c [2]). The following report is based on the most recent
oath-toolkit release tag for version 2.6.11.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

The PAM module is typically configured using a PAM stack configuration line
like this:

    auth [user_unknown=ignore success=ok] pam_oath.so usersfile=${HOME}/user.oath window=20

The expansion logic of the path components ${HOME} or ${USER} is part of the
problematic feature that introduced the security issue.

The PAM module invokes a liboath library function called
`oath_authenticate_usersfile()` found in liboath/usersfile.c, which manages
all accesses to the usersfile. Privileges are not dropped, and the function is
not aware of the special privileged PAM context. All file accesses in the
function are naive and follow symlinks. The relevant file operations that are
carried out on successful OTP entry are as follows:

- opening of the usersfile via `fopen()` for reading (usersfile.c:470).
- opening of a lockfile parallel to the usersfile using a filename suffix ".lock" via `fopen()` for writing (usersfile.c:332)
- locking of the lockfile using POSIX advisory locks via `fcntl()` (usersfile.c:350)
- creation of a new usersfile parallel to the old usersfile using a filename suffix ".new" via `fopen()` (usersfile.c:372)
- changing ownership of the new usersfile to the to-be-authenticated user via `fchown()` (usersfile.c:394)
- renaming of the new usersfile to the old usersfile via `rename()` (usersfile.c:411)
- unlinking of the previously created lockfile (usersfile.c:423)

If this happens in a PAM stack running as root and the usersfile is located in
an unprivileged user's home directory, then a simple root exploit is possible
by placing a symlink like this:

    user$ ln -s /etc/shadow $HOME/user.oath.new

This will cause /etc/shadow to be overwritten and its ownership will be
changed to the to-be-authenticated user. The to-be-authenticated user can
obtain full root privileges. No race condition needs to be won and no
pathnames have to be guessed.

Embargo Process and Upstream Communication
==========================================

Fabian Vogt first approached the main upstream author by email. Since we did not
get a reaction for several days, we created a private Gitlab issue in the
upstream project [3], offering coordinated disclosure. There was no reaction,
thus we decided to handle the embargo and bugfix ourselves, since we needed a
fixed `pam_oath` module for our products. We developed a comprehensive patch,
attached to this report and described in "SUSE Bugfix" below.

We requested a CVE from Mitre for this issue and they assigned CVE-2024-47191.

As we were preparing to go public, the upstream author got pinged via private
channels and reacted to our report, preparing an upstream bugfix release
addressing the issue, described in "Upstream Bugfix" below.

Due to time constraints, we have decided to apply our SUSE bugfix to our
products for the time being, until we can evaluate the upstream solution in more
depth.

SUSE Bugfix
===========

We developed the attached patch within SUSE to address the issue. The
situation for the bugfix is more complex than it might look at first, because
many things are unclear or broken in the current source code:

- the PAM module cannot know for sure if the target usersfile is supposed to
  be owned by root or by the to-be-authenticated user, or even some unrelated
  user. The presence of a ${HOME} path element makes it likely that the
  to-be-authenticated user is supposed to own the file. The presence of a
  ${USER} element is not that clear, however.
- the locking mechanism used in the current source code is broken:
  - the usersfile is initially opened for reading and parsed without owning
    the lock (usersfile.c:470). A parallel task can be about to replace this
    file with a new version, thus a lost update can occur.
  - the lock file is unlinked again after the usersfile has been updated
    (usersfile.c:423). This breaks when another task is waiting on the
    now-unlinked lockfile, while a third task arrives, sees no lockfile and
    creates a new one.
- the lockfile is placed in the user's home directory, possibly cluttering it.
  Cases like the home directory being a network file system (NFS, CIFS) would
  need to be considered. The unprivileged user might also prevent the privileged
  PAM stack from obtaining the lock, causing a local denial-of-service.

We decided to develop a patch that takes as many use cases as possible into
account, securing all operations while maintaining backwards compatibility.
With the patch, the usersfile path is safely traversed using the `*at` family
of system calls. Privileges will be dropped to the owner of the usersfile as an
additional security measure. The locking mechanism has been fixed to cover all
accesses to the usersfile. Instead of creating a separate lockfile, the
usersfile itself is used for locking, which avoids cluttering the home
directory. Additional sanity checks are added e.g. world-writable directory
components are denied. The patch employs Linux specific features (e.g. linking
files from /proc/self/fd), thus it no longer works for non-Linux systems. The
patch description and code comments contain more hints about the individual
decisions taken in this patch.

Upstream Bugfix
===============

Upstream developed an alternative solution, designed to be more portable and
cross-platform. This does not take into account all aspects that we considered
in the "SUSE Bugfix", but should be sufficient to fix the specific security
issue described in this report.

This fix has been released in version 2.6.12 of oath-toolkit. Upstream has also
published an associated Security Advisory [4].

Timeline
========

2024-08-08: Fabian Vogt of SUSE sent an email to the main upstream author,
            describing the issue. The SUSE Security Team was involved as well.
2024-08-20: After not receiving any reply by email, we created a private
            GitLab issue [3] describing the vulnerability and offering
            coordinated disclosure.
2024-08-28: SUSE started developing an internal patch for the issue.
2024-09-19: Our internal patch was getting ready for publication. We added a
            comment in the private GitLab issue, granting two final weeks of
            embargo time before we will publish the vulnerability and the patch.
            We also shared the current patch in the issue.
2024-09-19: We requested a CVE for the issue from Mitre.
2024-09-20: Mitre assigned CVE-2024-47191.
2024-09-29: After being pinged via private channels, the main upstream author
            reacted to our communication and started preparing a bugfix release.
2024-10-04: Upstream published release 2.6.12 containing the bugfix.
