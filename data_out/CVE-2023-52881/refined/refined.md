{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TCP ACK sequence number validation was not strict enough, allowing ACKs for bytes that were never sent to be accepted.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the ACK sequence number in TCP connections. The kernel, based on RFC 793 and RFC 5961, would accept ACK values that were below the send unacknowledged sequence number (SND.UNA) or acknowledged data not yet sent by the server. This relaxed validation could lead to security issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By sending a crafted ACK packet with a large sequence number, an attacker could potentially cause issues such as: \n\n*   Bypassing security measures that rely on correct sequence numbers.\n*   Potentially injecting data or disrupting the TCP connection.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted TCP ACK packet to the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system, and spoof IP address to initiate TCP connection to a server with a large window scale option (such as 14) which leads to large window sizes."
