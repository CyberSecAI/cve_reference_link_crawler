- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the DHCP options handling process, before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable TP-Link Omada ER605 router. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to send a crafted DHCP packet with oversized data in one of the options.
