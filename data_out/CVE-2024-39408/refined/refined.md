{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Security feature bypass. An attacker could potentially modify settings or perform actions within the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access. The attacker crafts a malicious request that is triggered when a victim interacts with it (e.g., clicks a link or loads a webpage).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a victim to interact with a malicious link or content. No specific access to the application is required. The attacker can be external to the application."
