{
  "CVE-2022-42055": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a broken type of command injection in the `ping` and `traceroute` functionality within the cloud manager web interface. Instead of executing commands, it performs arbitrary file reads by prepending `/bin/sh` to the file path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-23: Improper Restriction of Pathname to Resources",
      "CWE-25: Path Traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read any arbitrary file on the file system, including application source code, configuration files, and other critical system files. This could potentially lead to credential compromise if shadow and passwd files are accessed.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the cloud manager web interface, specifically through the `ping` and `traceroute` functionalities available in the device editing tools.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a legitimate user with access to the cloud management interface (goodcloud.xyz) with a configured device and be logged into the enterprise account and access the device editing interface tools."
