Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero error. Specifically, it occurs in `IW44Image.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The code lacks proper checks for zero-size images when allocating `GBuffer`, which leads to a division by zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability would likely lead to a crash of the application or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted DjVu file containing an image with a zero size or other characteristics that trigger the division by zero within `IW44Image.cpp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DjVu file to an application using the vulnerable djvulibre library. This could occur through various means, such as a user opening a malicious file directly or indirectly through a web application that processes DjVu files.

**Additional Details:**
- This CVE is resolved in djvulibre versions 3.5.28-7.fc39, 3.5.28-6.fc38 and 3.5.28-9.fc40 (and later) by implementing checks for zero-size images when allocating `GBuffer`.
- The vulnerability was reported in Red Hat Bugzilla as Bug #2234739.
