**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The installer of the e-Tax software (common program) contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious DLL to be executed with higher privileges by altering the registry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can gain higher privileges than a general user by exploiting the vulnerability in the installer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- The attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected system.
- Compromise of the application's security and potentially other parts of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the registry in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have low privileges on the local machine.
- Ability to modify registry entries and place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it.
