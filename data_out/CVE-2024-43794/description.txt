OpenSearch Dashboards Security Plugin adds a configuration management UI for the OpenSearch Security features to OpenSearch Dashboards. Improper validation of the nextUrl parameter can lead to external redirect on login to OpenSearch-Dashboards for specially crafted parameters. A patch is available in 1.3.19 and 2.16.0 for this issue.
