{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A rewrite rule in the application creates an empty string as the value of the Authorization header if no Authorization header is present in the request. The CSRF check is then bypassed because it compares the header value to null, not an empty string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Inadequate CSRF protection mechanism (comparing header value to null instead of checking for empty or missing header)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user. For example, a new administrator account can be created if the request is executed in the browser of an authenticated victim.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "CSRF attack via a malicious website or email.",
       "The attacker crafts a malicious request that is sent to the vulnerable application in the context of an authenticated user’s browser."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link that executes the forged request.  No prior authentication is needed by the attacker, only user interaction to trigger the malicious request is required."
