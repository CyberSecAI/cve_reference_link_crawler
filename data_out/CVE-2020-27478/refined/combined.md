| Search-bar contains Reflected Cross-Site Scripting The search-bar that functions as a product filter is vulnerable to XSS since it does not perform any validation nor sanitization on users’ input. An example of exploitation of this vulnerability is shown below,  [poc_reflected_xss_simplcommerce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44452208/94252268-98254280-ff1b-11ea-93c5-fb4a62793e09.PNG)  As illustrated above, since the application doesn't perform any processing of the data, an attacker can construct a basic XSS payload like this,  `</script><script>alert(‘s1nj0r0’)<script>`  triggering cross-site scripting. In other words, the malicious input is injected in the HTML opening a script tag with an alert method. As shown, the alert was triggered confirming that the code is vulnerable. Exploitation and Mitigation The following figure illustrates the vulnerable code. The user-supplied data is passed directly through an `@Html.Raw` which allows outputting text containing HTML elements to the client, and have them still be rendered as such *i.e.*, will allow the execution of any script that is on the value to display, exposing *SimplCommerce* to cross-site scripting.  [Index.cshtml](https://github.com/simplcommerce/SimplCommerce/blob/cbf80cdc0c0b9bce93e35f05a4d6ed16417ab1b5/src/Modules/SimplCommerce.Module.Search/Areas/Search/Views/Search/Index.cshtml)  [search_bar_reflected_xss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44452208/94253521-57c6c400-ff1d-11ea-850e-d9a8b8b64ba6.PNG) How should I fix it? Sanitizing the user-supplied data is the key to avoid XSS. Moreover, `@Html.Raw` is just a tool but if you are displaying user-supplied data it is better to use another method such as `@Html.Encode()`. However, `@Html.Encode()` does not cover all XSS attacks. Useful Links [Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Software Attack | OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) |

| Thanks [@s1nj0r0](https://github.com/s1nj0r0) for reporting this, `@Html.Raw` may not appropriate in this case, so we need to sanitize the HTML before use it |
