The provided content is related to CVE-2020-27478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The search bar in SimplCommerce application does not sanitize or validate user input, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application uses `@Html.Raw` to output user-supplied data which allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization and use of `@Html.Raw` to display user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search bar. This code would then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the search bar. An attacker crafts a malicious URL or form that includes the XSS payload in the search query. When a user clicks the link or submits the form, the malicious script is rendered in the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or form, and convince the victim to click or submit the malicious request.
