- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the input protection mechanism, where it relies on the existence or values of a specific input. An attacker can bypass this mechanism by modifying this input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation or insufficient protection mechanisms. Specifically, the application is not properly checking the validity of an input before processing it, which leads to the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view data beyond their authorization scope. This is an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends a crafted request to an affected device. The attacker modifies a specific input to bypass protection mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and remote.
