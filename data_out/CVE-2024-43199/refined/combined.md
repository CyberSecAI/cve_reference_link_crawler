### @orlitzky **[orlitzky](/orlitzky)** commented [Mar 3, 2024](#issue-2165062483)

Installing executables as `nagios:nagios` (the default) is a security issue on a typical system where those executables will wind up in everyone's `PATH`. In these two commits I simply delete the special handling, letting all executables be installed mode 755 with the owner unchanged. (This would result in `root:root` ownership for a "normal" `/usr/bin` install.)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Three executables -- file2sock, log2ndo, and sockdebug -- are
currently being installed group-writable but not
world-executable. This is in contrast with the other two executables,
ndo2db and ndomod.o, that are installed mode 0755.

Having recently removed the INSTALL_OPTS that were altering the
owner:group of these files, there is no longer any security risk to
mode 0774. However, 0755 is more consistent with both the rest of our
executables, and with the typical permissions on /usr/bin that arise
from the (extremely common) umask of 0022.

We change these three to 0755 for a little bit of extra peace of mind.

1. [configure.ac: don't install binaries as ndo2db\_user:ndo2db\_group](/NagiosEnterprises/ndoutils/commit/18ef12037f4a68772d6840cbaa08aa2da07d2891)
    …

   ```
   In configure.ac we were adding two flags to INSTALL_OPTS that change
   the owner:group of all installed files to ndo2db_user:ndo2db_group.
   This is often a security vulnerability, since executables (we have a
   few) are typically installed into everyone's PATH. If root ever
   executes them, the ndo2db_user can take advantage of the situation to
   run malicious code as root.

   Fortunately the change in ownership is not really needed. We simply
   drop the INSTALL_OPTS, which are used for nothing else, allowing our
   files to be installed as the user who is doing the installing. When
   installing to one of the system PATHs, that will almost always be
   root.
   ```

2. [src/Makefile.in: install all executables with mode 0755](/NagiosEnterprises/ndoutils/commit/69a80d6a9bf1196ffcfffa7f756633bb13a62b5f)
    …

   ```
   Three executables -- file2sock, log2ndo, and sockdebug -- are
   currently being installed group-writable but not
   world-executable. This is in contrast with the other two executables,
   ndo2db and ndomod.o, that are installed mode 0755.

   Having recently removed the INSTALL_OPTS that were altering the
   owner:group of these files, there is no longer any security risk to
   mode 0774. However, 0755 is more consistent with both the rest of our
   executables, and with the typical permissions on /usr/bin that arise
   from the (extremely common) umask of 0022.

   We change these three to 0755 for a little bit of extra peace of mind.
