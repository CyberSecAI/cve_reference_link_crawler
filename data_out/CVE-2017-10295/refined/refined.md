{
  "CVE-2017-10295": {
    "description": "The HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes in the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to check for newline characters embedded in URLs. An attacker able to make a Java application perform an HTTP request using an attacker provided URL could possibly inject additional headers into the request.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation for newline characters in URLs within HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP header injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially inject additional headers into an HTTP request, by crafting a URL with newline characters. This could allow for actions such as HTTP response splitting, cookie manipulation, or other HTTP header-based attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious URL with embedded newline characters and persuading a Java application to make an HTTP request using that URL.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious URL to a Java application, which then performs an HTTP request using that URL."
