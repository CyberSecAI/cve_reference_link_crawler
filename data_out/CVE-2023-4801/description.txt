An improper certification validation vulnerability in the Insider Threat Management (ITM) Agent for MacOS could be used by an anonymous actor on an adjacent network to establish a man-in-the-middle position between the agent and the ITM server after the agent has registered. All versions prior to 7.14.3.69 are affected. Agents for Windows, Linux, and Cloud are unaffected.
