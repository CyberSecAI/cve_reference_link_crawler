Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "CBX Map for Google Map & OpenStreetMap" is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the website.
*   **Website Manipulation:** These scripts can be used to redirect users to malicious sites, display unwanted advertisements, or execute other HTML payloads.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Depending on the nature of the injected scripts, user sessions could be hijacked or other user data compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is likely triggered when the plugin processes user input, which is not sanitized before being displayed on the website.
*   The attacker would inject the malicious scripts through a vulnerable input field or setting provided by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable input field of the plugin to inject the malicious script.
*   The attacker requires Contributor level access.
