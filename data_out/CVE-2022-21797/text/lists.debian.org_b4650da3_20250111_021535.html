Package        : joblib
Version        : 0.13.0-2+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-21797
Debian Bug     : 1020820

It was discovered that joblib did not completely sanitize arguments to
pre_dispatch, allowing arbitrary code execution. The earlier attempt via
DLA-3193-1 was incomplete.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.13.0-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your joblib packages.

For the detailed security status of joblib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/joblib>
