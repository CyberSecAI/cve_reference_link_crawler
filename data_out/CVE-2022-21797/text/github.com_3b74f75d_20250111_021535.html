Fixes [#1128](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1128)

Make sure nothing's available to `eval` for `pre_dispatch`.

| Thanks for the fix! I assume that this is enough but alternatively we could try to use the `ast` module to parse the tree to check that there are only arithmetic operations involved.  Let's wait for the CI to complete before merging. |
