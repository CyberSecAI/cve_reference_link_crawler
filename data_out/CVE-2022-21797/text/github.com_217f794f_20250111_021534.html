| As the title shows, if you try to enter a statement in the flag `pre_dispatch`, it will run whatever you want to run. This should present a potential security vulnerability.  ``` def f():     return 1 p = Parallel(n_jobs=3, pre_dispatch="sys.exit(0)") p(delayed(f)() for i in range(10)) # this will cause the system to exit ```     [joblib/joblib/parallel.py](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642/joblib/parallel.py#L1020)  Line 1020 in [53a8173](/joblib/joblib/commit/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642)   |  | pre\_dispatch = eval(pre\_dispatch) | | --- | --- | |

| Thanks for the report. We should indeed improve this by making sure that the `pre_dispatch` expression only has expression to a list of symbols and cannot import modules. |

| [@jimlinntu](https://github.com/jimlinntu) [@ogrisel](https://github.com/ogrisel) What is the rationale of marking this a *security* issue? Presumably if someone uses `Parallel` they can already submit *whatever* code they want.  Unless I'm missing something, restricting `pre_dispatch` expressions will not change the security level of joblib (and this issue is not a potential security vulnerability to begin with, afaict). Even with the rather complex fix in [#1327](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1327) the following will reproduce the exact behavior. To be sure, this is intended behavior, and there is no need to restrict `f()`, as that would render `Parallel` unusable.  ``` def f():     sys.exit(0) p = Parallel(n_jobs=3, pre_dispatch="5*n_jobs") p(delayed(f)() for i in range(10)) # this will cause the system to exit  ```  The rationale for using `eval(pre_dispatch)` in the code is for syntactic reasons, such that the developer can write code like `Parallel(..., pre_dispatch='5*n_jobs')`, as noted in the [docstring](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642/joblib/parallel.py#L484). If we think use of `eval()` should be avoided (in case of what use case?), I would suggest the better path would be to deprecate this feature and remove it all together, or perhaps replace it with a callable. With a callable, the code would then be e.g. `Parallel(..., pre_dispatch=lambda : 5 * n_jobs)` which is only slightly less readable, albeit a lot more annoying to write . |

| [@ogrisel](https://github.com/ogrisel) Ok, I see how this might be a potential issue, though I would think this comes down to secure programming practices, i.e. never trust user input. Anyhow, I would prefer if pre\_dispatch were changed into accepting expressions as a callable only, or perhaps to document the use of eval(). |

| It's not just a user facing web UI. This argument is passed to `Parallel` by downstream libraries and that means if those downstream libraries somehow load some pre-existing persisted object, the user can easily exploit the fact that whatever's passed to pre\_dispatch runs in `eval`.  We certainly shouldn't allow callable as an expression, since that itself again opens the door to easy exploitation.  Accepting a callable, however, might be okay. |
