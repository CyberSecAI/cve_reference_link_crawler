| As the title shows, if you try to enter a statement in the flag `pre_dispatch`, it will run whatever you want to run. This should present a potential security vulnerability.  ``` def f():     return 1 p = Parallel(n_jobs=3, pre_dispatch="sys.exit(0)") p(delayed(f)() for i in range(10)) # this will cause the system to exit ```     [joblib/joblib/parallel.py](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642/joblib/parallel.py#L1020)  Line 1020 in [53a8173](/joblib/joblib/commit/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642)   |  | pre\_dispatch = eval(pre\_dispatch) | | --- | --- | |

| Thanks for the report. We should indeed improve this by making sure that the `pre_dispatch` expression only has expression to a list of symbols and cannot import modules. |

| [@jimlinntu](https://github.com/jimlinntu) [@ogrisel](https://github.com/ogrisel) What is the rationale of marking this a *security* issue? Presumably if someone uses `Parallel` they can already submit *whatever* code they want.  Unless I'm missing something, restricting `pre_dispatch` expressions will not change the security level of joblib (and this issue is not a potential security vulnerability to begin with, afaict). Even with the rather complex fix in [#1327](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1327) the following will reproduce the exact behavior. To be sure, this is intended behavior, and there is no need to restrict `f()`, as that would render `Parallel` unusable.  ``` def f():     sys.exit(0) p = Parallel(n_jobs=3, pre_dispatch="5*n_jobs") p(delayed(f)() for i in range(10)) # this will cause the system to exit  ```  The rationale for using `eval(pre_dispatch)` in the code is for syntactic reasons, such that the developer can write code like `Parallel(..., pre_dispatch='5*n_jobs')`, as noted in the [docstring](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/53a8173d8e23ae8d6152fc3ee7e4962ae79e1642/joblib/parallel.py#L484). If we think use of `eval()` should be avoided (in case of what use case?), I would suggest the better path would be to deprecate this feature and remove it all together, or perhaps replace it with a callable. With a callable, the code would then be e.g. `Parallel(..., pre_dispatch=lambda : 5 * n_jobs)` which is only slightly less readable, albeit a lot more annoying to write . |

| [@ogrisel](https://github.com/ogrisel) Ok, I see how this might be a potential issue, though I would think this comes down to secure programming practices, i.e. never trust user input. Anyhow, I would prefer if pre\_dispatch were changed into accepting expressions as a callable only, or perhaps to document the use of eval(). |

| It's not just a user facing web UI. This argument is passed to `Parallel` by downstream libraries and that means if those downstream libraries somehow load some pre-existing persisted object, the user can easily exploit the fact that whatever's passed to pre\_dispatch runs in `eval`.  We certainly shouldn't allow callable as an expression, since that itself again opens the door to easy exploitation.  Accepting a callable, however, might be okay. |

## How to fix?

Upgrade `joblib` to version 1.1.1 or higher.

## Overview

[joblib](https://pypi.org/project/joblib) is a Lightweight pipelining with Python functions

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via the `pre_dispatch` flag in `Parallel()` class due to the `eval()` statement.

## PoC

```
def f():
    return 1
p = Parallel(n_jobs=3, pre_dispatch="sys.exit(0)")
p(delayed(f)() for i in range(10)) # this will cause the system to exit

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

Debian Bug     : 1020820

It was discovered that joblib did not completely sanitize arguments to
pre_dispatch, allowing arbitrary code execution. The earlier attempt via
DLA-3193-1 was incomplete.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.13.0-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your joblib packages.
