- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control allows read-only administrators to modify the LDAP server used for connectivity tests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the ability of read-only users to manipulate the destination of LDAP connectivity tests. This bypasses the intended restriction of read-only access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to obtain the LDAP server login credentials configured in the FortiGate/FortiADC by pointing the connectivity test to a rogue LDAP server controlled by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by a read-only admin user who modifies the LDAP server used for connectivity testing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a read-only administrator of FortiGate/FortiADC to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to have a malicious LDAP server set up.
