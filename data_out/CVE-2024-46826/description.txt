In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ELF: fix kernel.randomize_va_space double read

ELF loader uses "randomize_va_space" twice. It is sysctl and can change
at any moment, so 2 loads could see 2 different values in theory with
unpredictable consequences.

Issue exactly one load for consistent value across one exec.
