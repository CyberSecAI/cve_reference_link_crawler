Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from sensitive information being displayed in cleartext within the command-line interface (CLI) when using the `diagnose sys ha checksum` command in FortiOS and FortiProxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:**  VPN user passwords and other sensitive data are not properly protected and are displayed in plain text in the CLI output.
- **Information Disclosure:** The lack of proper handling of sensitive data allows for unauthorized disclosure of this data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as user passwords, which can be leveraged for further malicious activities.
- **Compromise of VPN Accounts/Access:** Exposed user passwords could lead to unauthorized access to VPN accounts, allowing the attacker to access the internal network, potentially leading to more serious compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CLI Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to the CLI of the affected FortiOS or FortiProxy device. This could be done through compromised credentials, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- **Command Execution:** Once CLI access is obtained, the attacker needs to execute the `diagnose sys ha checksum show` command to expose the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the CLI interface of the FortiGate or FortiProxy device.
- **Command Execution Capability:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute the specific `diagnose sys ha checksum show` command on the CLI.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **FortiOS:** Versions 6.2.4 and below.
*   **FortiProxy:** Version 2.0.0.

**Mitigation:**
*   **FortiOS:** Upgrade to version 6.4.0 or above, 6.2.5 or above, or 6.0.12 or above.
*   **FortiProxy:** Upgrade to version 2.0.1 or above or 1.2.10 or above.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3 score of 5.2.
- The vulnerability was reported under responsible disclosure.
- The information was initially published on 2020-10-19 for FortiOS and 2021-03-02 for FortiProxy.
