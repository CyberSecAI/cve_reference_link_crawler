Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `page` parameter of the `/model/delete_record.php` file within the Complete Web-Based School Management System. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS because it does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input in the `page` parameter before rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This script can perform a range of actions, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - Modifying website content.
    - Downloading malware to the user's system.
- Reputation Damage: The trusted website may suffer reputation damage if it is compromised through XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker can craft a URL containing a malicious payload in the `page` parameter and trick a victim into visiting it. For example, `page=1<svg%20onload=alert(6315)>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker does not require any authentication or authorization level.
- The victim must be enticed to click the crafted link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Complete Web-Based School Management System.
- The exploit payload used is: `page=1<svg%20onload=alert(6315)>`
- The vulnerability resides in the `/model/delete_record.php` file.
