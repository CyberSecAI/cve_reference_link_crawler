# Ways to Improve Network Security

This article introduces some protections you can take on your Vigor Router to keep the network safe, including how to block unauthorized users, as well as what protecting the local network from the threats on the Internet.

This article introduces some protections you can take on your Vigor Router to keep the network safe, including how to block unauthorized users, as well as what protecting the local network from the threats on the Internet.

* [Wireless Network Security](#wifi)
* [Internet Access Security](#Internet)

#### **Router Security Protection**

##### Change the default admin password and enable Two Factor Authentication for Remote Access

Plenty of the routers on the market use the same default password for their management page login; thus, the login password of your router is extremely easy to guess. Be sure to change your router’s login password from **System Maintenance >> Administrator Password**page, and also adopt a password which is strong enough.

![](/assets/files/faq/2017/T26813/change admin password.png)

Two Factor Authentication can add a layer of security when accessing router from Internet. Please follow the guide [Use 2-Step Authentication for Remote Access](/support/knowledge-base/5172) to set up two factor authentication that will not only require the administrator password but also the Auth-Code that is sent to the specific receiver, and also [Use TOTP for Remote Access](/support/knowledge-base/7580) to setup TOTP which will need a TOTP Authenticator app to generate the time-based one-time-password.

##### Keep the firmware up to date

Always use the latest firmware version on your Vigor Router and Vigor AP to make sure all the security patches (and also the new features!) are included. You can get the latest firmware at [https://www.draytek.com/support/latest-firmwares/](/support/latest-firmwares/)

##### Set up Access List for management access

Access List is highly recommended when management from the Internet is allowed. You can restrict the router’s access from a selected peer only by adding it to the Access List. Since firmware 4.4.0, Vigor Router supports pre-defined IP Object, IP Group and Hostname in Access List.

![](/assets/files/faq/2017/T26813/access list.png)
##### Disable VPN services not in use VPN ports are open when the VPN services are enabled, it's recommended disabling them if they are not in use. Use Firewall features to Protect the opening VPN service. When the VPN server serves clients from a specific country, create a country object and add the firewall rules to allow VPN access only from these IPs. Block the unknown IPs by DoS Defense >> Blacklist. Change the management port By default, Vigor Router uses the well-known ports for its web interface, command-line interface, and other services. Therefore, LAN clients can easily access the management page of the router as long as they find out the router’s IP address. Changing the service port will make accessing the login page a little more difficult, you can configure this at**System Maintenance >> Management** page. Enable Brute Force Protection Once reaches the login page, even without the login password, the attacker can try every possible passphrase until eventually the correct login password is found, although it takes time. Enable Brute Force Protection allows Vigor Router to identify the IP address that has failed in login too many times, and block their login attempt for a penalty period, and it will considerably increase the amount of time that takes to find the correct password. Enable Port Knocking to secure the management interface When ports are open, they are at risk of being attack. Thus, you can enable Port Knocking feature at **System Maintenance >> Management** page. It will close all the ports and set a password based on the port combination. Only those who know the password can open the ports and connect. **Local Network Security**Implementing VLAN for guests Setting up VLAN on the local network allows you to isolate the guest from the private network while providing Internet connectivity to them. Also, the support of multiple subnets allows the private network and guest network to be on different IP subnets and have separate DHCP settings or policies. If you have a VLAN capable switch on the network, you can follow the guide [Use Multiple LAN Subnets with Tag-Based VLAN](/support/knowledge-base/) to set up VLAN on Vigor Router. The multi-SSID of VigorAP can be mapped to different VLAN as well, see[Add a Separate Wireless Network for Guests](/support/knowledge-base/5320) for more details. If there’s no VLAN-capable switch nor AP, Vigor Router can also do port-based VLAN, visit [Use Multiple LAN Subnets with Port-Based VLAN](/support/knowledge-base/4911) for instruction. Disable DHCP server and change the LAN IP For a device to communicate with the router, it needs to use an IP address in the same subnet as the router. While DHCP function is enabled, the router will automatically assign a valid IP address to the device connected to the network. If you don't want un-authorized hosts to access the network, you can disable the DHCP server, and manually configure the IP on authorized hosts. You might also want to change the LAN IP range as well, so it is more difficult for the un-authorized hosts to find out the IP range. The IP and DHCP settings can be configured at **LAN >> General Setup >> LAN1 Details Page**. Shut down the unused ports on the switches An open Ethernet port gives rogue devices access to the private network; therefore, make the ports not-in-use are disabled in the Switch configuration. If you are using a Vigor Router that supports SWM (Central Switch Management) along with VigorSwitches, you can view the Switch's port status from the router's management page and shut down an unused port directly. **Wireless Network Security**Use WPA2 security mode Since the wireless traffic is sent over the air, it can be eavesdropped by anyone nearby; therefore, be sure to apply security settings for encrypting the traffic, as well as controlling the access to the local network. Among WEP, WPA, and WPA2, WPA2 is the strongest security protocol and is what we recommend to use.

Cyber attacks from the Internet are endless. We should add protections on our Vigor Router to keep the network safe, including how to block unauthorized users, as well as what protecting the local network from the threats on the Internet.

#### **Router Security Protection**

##### 1. Always Use Secure Protocols for Internet Activity

Disable the Internet access on your Vigor router when you don’t need it. If the remote access is needed, please always use the secured protocols, e.g.use HTTPS instead of HTTP and use SSH instead of Telnet. Remember to restrict the router’s access to a selected IP address/subnet by adding it to the access list. Access LIst is highly recommended when management from the Internet is allowed.
