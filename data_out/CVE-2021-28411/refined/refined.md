Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `CookieRememberMeManager` class in the project, which was introduced during a rewrite of the open-source project. This class, combined with the use of a default key and a vulnerable version of the `commons-collections` library, leads to a Shiro deserialization vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Shiro Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is an insecure deserialization issue within the Shiro framework.
*   **Default Key Usage:** The project employs the default encryption key within Shiro, making it easier for attackers to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Vulnerable `commons-collections` Library:** The project uses a version of the `commons-collections` library susceptible to deserialization attacks (specifically versions prior to 3.2.2, although the text states that the commonscollection exploit chain uses version 3.2.2 and above).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious serialized payload that is sent to the application. The application, when attempting to process a remember-me cookie, deserializes this payload due to the vulnerable `CookieRememberMeManager` implementation. The malicious payload is specifically designed to exploit the vulnerable `commons-collections` library using the commonscollection exploit chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted remember-me cookie to the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication is necessary to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability is present when processing the remember-me cookie.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided text includes links to example exploit tools, which also indicates the vulnerability is readily exploitable if the vulnerable conditions are present.
* The text mentions the official fix is to remove the `CookieRememberMeManager` class which was not present in the original version of the project.
* The issue indicates that the project uses shiro 1.7.0 which is not vulnerable, however, the custom implementation using `CookieRememberMeManager` reintroduces the deserialization vulnerability.
