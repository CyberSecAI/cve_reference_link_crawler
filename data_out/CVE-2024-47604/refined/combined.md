We only have [custom styles](<https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/f1434e76555bf7c8f8b29b0e9a7d08f1f1b76982/src/Bootstrap/less/theme/base.less#L624-L636>) for when `id="/"`, no need to have it specified in any other case.
Also fixes incorrect styling when query parameters are present for the root page.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

We only have [custom styles](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/f1434e76555bf7c8f8b29b0e9a7d08f1f1b76982/src/Bootstrap/less/theme/base.less#L624-L636) for when `id="/"`, no need to have it specified in any other case. Also fixes incorrect styling when query parameters are present for the root page.
