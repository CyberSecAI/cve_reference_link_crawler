Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of code generation within the `mdx-mermaid` component. Specifically, the component doesn't sanitize or validate the input provided for mermaid diagrams, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code within a mermaid code block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The `mdx-mermaid` component directly processes and renders the provided mermaid diagram content. By inserting a JavaScript function wrapped in backticks, an attacker can have it execute when the component is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):** The attacker can potentially access limited user data accessible within the browser's context.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** The attacker can modify the content displayed in the browser, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
- **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly cause a denial of service or impact the availability of the application, as stated by the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Injection via Mermaid code blocks:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code within a mermaid code block that is processed by the `mdx-mermaid` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to insert content into an MDX document, they do not need any special privileges on the system or application.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any specific user interaction after the malicious content has been introduced, execution happens automatically when the component is loaded.
- **Local Attack Vector:** The CVSS score specifies a local attack vector, which means that the attacker needs to have some form of access to modify the content processed by the vulnerable component.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes example code demonstrating how to inject the arbitrary JavaScript into the mermaid code block:
  ```
  ` + (function () {
    alert('vulnerable')
    return ''
  }()) + `
  ```
- The vulnerability affects versions `0.0.1`, `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.1.1`, `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`, `1.2.3`, and `2.0.0-rc1` of `mdx-mermaid`.
- Patched versions are `1.3.0` and `2.0.0-rc2`.
- There are no known workarounds.
