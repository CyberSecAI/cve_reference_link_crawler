- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Kubernetes secrets within the IBM Storage Defender Connection Manager on-premises environment (OVA) are obfuscated using base64 encoding instead of being properly encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Inadequate encryption of sensitive data (Kubernetes secrets). The secrets are only base64 encoded, which is easily reversible, rather than being encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with root access to the environment can read and potentially misuse the exposed secrets from the Kubernetes configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who has already obtained root access to the target on-premises environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have root-level access to the environment where the vulnerable IBM Storage Defender Connection Manager is deployed.
