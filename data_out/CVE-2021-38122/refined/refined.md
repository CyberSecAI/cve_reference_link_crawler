*   **Vulnerability:** The document mentions that "This release resolves the following security vulnerabilities:" and lists CVE-2021-38122 as one of them. However, it doesn't provide specific details about the vulnerability itself, only a link to [KM000033425](https://portal.microfocus.com/s/article/KM000033425) for further information.

Since the document only indicates that the vulnerability is fixed in this release and refers to an external article, I will respond with NOINFO.
