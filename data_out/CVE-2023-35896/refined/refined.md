Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35896:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of Oracle Outside In Technology within certain configurations of IBM Content Navigator's document viewer. Specifically, it is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue within this technology.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The Oracle Outside In Technology is vulnerable to SSRF, allowing an attacker to potentially make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: The SSRF vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file reads, meaning an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive files on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the document viewer functionality of IBM Content Navigator that uses the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the document viewer functionality of IBM Content Navigator in a way that triggers the use of the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology and the subsequent SSRF. This could involve uploading/viewing specially crafted documents that exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:** This vulnerability is due to an SSRF in Oracle Outside In Technology, which is used by IBM Content Navigator. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary file reads. The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the document viewer in such a way that it triggers the vulnerable component.
