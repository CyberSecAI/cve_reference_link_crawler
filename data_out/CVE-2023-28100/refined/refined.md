Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28100:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the ability of the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl, when used on a Linux virtual console (like `/dev/tty1`), to perform copy/paste operations that can inject text into the command buffer. This is similar to the `TIOCSTI` vulnerability (CVE-2017-5226), but uses a different ioctl.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unrestricted `TIOCLINUX` ioctl:** The primary weakness is that Flatpak did not restrict the use of `TIOCLINUX` ioctl within its sandbox when running on Linux virtual consoles.
- **Command injection:** Copy/pasting via `TIOCLINUX` can inject arbitrary commands into the console's command buffer.
- **Sandbox Escape:** By injecting malicious commands, an attacker can potentially escape the Flatpak sandbox and execute commands outside of it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into the virtual console's command buffer which could be executed once the flatpak application exits.
- **Privilege Escalation/Sandbox Escape:** This could lead to privilege escalation or sandbox escape, depending on the commands injected.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack must occur on a Linux virtual console (e.g., `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2`, etc.). It is not applicable to standard terminal emulators like xterm or gnome-terminal
- **`TIOCLINUX` ioctl:** The attacker uses the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl with the copy/paste functionality to inject text into the command buffer of a virtual console.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local access to a Linux virtual console:** The attacker must have the ability to run the vulnerable Flatpak application within a Linux virtual console.
- **Ability to execute `TIOCLINUX` ioctl:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `TIOCLINUX` functionality from within the Flatpak application.

**Additional details:**

- **Mitigation:** The fix involves blocking the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl using seccomp filters. This ensures that the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl cannot be used within the Flatpak sandbox on virtual consoles.
- **Limited scope:**  The vulnerability is limited to Linux virtual consoles and does not affect standard terminal emulators.
- The provided commit `8e63de9a7d3124f91140fc74f8ca9ed73ed53be9` implements the fix by adding the `TIOCLINUX` to the list of blocked ioctls within the seccomp filter.
- The Gentoo advisory confirms the vulnerability affects flatpak versions before 1.14.4, 1.12.8, 1.10.8, and that it is rated as high severity with remote exploitability. This contradicts the Github advisory which classifies it as low severity.
