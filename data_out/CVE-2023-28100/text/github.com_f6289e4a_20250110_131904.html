# CVE-2023-28100: TIOCLINUX can send commands outside sandbox if running on a virtual console

Low

[smcv](/smcv)
published
GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp
Mar 16, 2023

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

< 1.10.8, 1.12.x < 1.12.8, 1.14.x < 1.14.4, 1.15.x < 1.15.4

## Patched versions

1.15.4, 1.10.x >= 1.10.8, 1.12.x >= 1.12.8, 1.14.x >= 1.14.4

## Description

### Impact

If a Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it into the command buffer, from which the command might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. This is similar to [CVE-2017-5226](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m28g-vfcm-85ff "CVE-2017-5226"), but using the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`.

Ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2` and so on, which are not commonly used to run Flatpak apps.

### Patches

[8e63de9](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/8e63de9a7d3124f91140fc74f8ca9ed73ed53be9)

See the `flatpak-1.14.x`, `flatpak-1.12.x`, `flatpak-1.10.x` branches for backports of this change to older codebases.

### Workarounds

Don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console. Flatpak is primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical environment.
