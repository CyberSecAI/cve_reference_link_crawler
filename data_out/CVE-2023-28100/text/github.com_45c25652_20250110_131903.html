run: Prevent TIOCLINUX ioctl, the same as TIOCSTI

```
The TIOCLINUX ioctl is only available on Linux virtual consoles such as
/dev/tty1. It has several Linux-specific functions, one of which is a
copy/paste operation which can be used for attacks similar to TIOCSTI.

This vulnerability does not affect typical graphical terminal emulators
such as xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole, and Flatpak is primarily
designed to be run from a Wayland or X11 graphical environment, so this
is relatively unlikely to be a practical problem.
