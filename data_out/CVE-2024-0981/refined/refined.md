- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Okta Browser Plugin versions 6.5.0 through 6.31.0 (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). This occurs when the plugin prompts the user to save new credentials within Okta Personal and fails to properly escape the input fields, resulting in injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper escaping of user-supplied input when saving credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser within the Okta Personal interface. This can lead to information disclosure, session hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin prompts to save new credentials within Okta Personal. An attacker could potentially manipulate these credentials input fields to inject malicious scripts if they have the ability to influence the displayed values, such as an attacker-controlled webpage that interacts with the browser plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to influence the input fields when the plugin prompts to save credentials within Okta Personal, typically by manipulating the fields on the page where the login is being attempted. User interaction is required, as the user would need to attempt to save manipulated credentials. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The affected user must have added Okta Personal to the plugin to enable multi-account view.
