Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `AviatorEvaluator` in `ExpressionUtil.java` to directly execute expressions without any configured security policies. This allows for the injection of malicious AviatorScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **AviatorScript Injection:** The application allows untrusted input to be processed by `AviatorEvaluator` without proper sanitization or security constraints.
*   **Unrestricted Method Execution:** The default behavior of `AviatorScript` allows the execution of arbitrary static methods, which can be leveraged to perform malicious actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting malicious AviatorScript payloads.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the RCE to gain access to sensitive data.
*   **System Compromise:** The RCE can be used to take full control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **No-code Module:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user adds a no-code module and sets a calculated formula using an AviatorScript payload.
*   **Calculated fields:** The specific example provided is setting a formula on a field (e.g., phone number field in the no-code module). When this module is triggered the malicious payload will execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to No-Code Module Configuration:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure the no-code module and set the calculated formula. This likely implies the attacker has at least contributor-level access to the application.
*   **Understanding of AviatorScript:** The attacker needs to know how to construct malicious payloads using AviatorScript syntax and available classes.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit code leverages `org.springframework.util.ClassUtils`, `org.springframework.util.Base64Utils`, and `org.springframework.cglib.core.ReflectUtils` to load and execute a malicious class.
*   The malicious class is compiled and then encoded as a base64 string to be inserted into the AviatorScript payload.
*   The malicious class utilizes `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Additional notes:**

*   The issue is present in the `latest` version of Wukong\_nocode as of the date the issue was opened on GitHub.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `wukongcrm`'s background no-code platform feature.
*   A patch has been applied in `apache/hertzbeat` but the commit only shows changes to the hertzbeat application, suggesting this may be a common dependency issue.
