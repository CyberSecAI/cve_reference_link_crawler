After searching several Schema Plugins, I found Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP. The main thing I was seeking was to introduce custom Schema in WooCommerce Categories to fill it with semantic associations as About & Mentions, very important for me and aligned with what I understand about Semantic Web: to drive machine’s interpretation. I like to do by myself JSON-LD, I’m an always learner and I don’t want to automate all, so this plugin is perfect. But there’s more, with this plugin, Google could see more Products Schema on the ecommerce I work for, I don’t know why… And also more reviews. This has been an unexpected feature I loved much more this plugin. And Plus+++, I ask them for a little feature, I explained it and they did it! So we are facing a great team and kind people.
