Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the WordPress Corona Virus (COVID-19) Banner & Live Data Plugin, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, specifically injection. This occurs due to the plugin not sanitizing user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts into the website.
*   These scripts, when executed by website visitors, can lead to:
    *   Redirects to malicious websites.
    *   Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    *   Other forms of HTML payload execution, potentially leading to further compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into user-controlled fields. 
*   The injected scripts are then executed in the context of the affected website when users visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts within the plugin.
*   The attacker needs to be able to find and manipulate the vulnerable input field (which the information doesn't specify).
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the server but the vulnerable input vector can be accessed by someone with administrative privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability has a low severity and is unlikely to be exploited.
*   The vulnerable versions are <= 1.8.0.3.
*   The fix is available in version 1.8.0.4 and later.
