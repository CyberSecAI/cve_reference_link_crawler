Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `encoding/pem` package of the Go programming language, specifically in the `Decode` function.
- The `Decode` function calls `decodeError`, a recursive function which could lead to a stack overflow when processing a large amount of PEM data that includes errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion in the `decodeError` function, triggered by large, malformed PEM data.
- Improper Resource allocation without limits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by causing the application to crash due to a stack overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends a specially crafted PEM file containing a large amount of data and errors to a vulnerable application using `encoding/pem.Decode`.
- The crafted PEM data triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PEM input. This can be done remotely.
- No special privileges are required.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Go versions prior to 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-24675.
- The fix involves removing the recursive call to decodeError.
