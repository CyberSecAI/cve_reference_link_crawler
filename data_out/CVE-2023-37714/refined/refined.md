Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromRouteStatic` function of Tenda routers. This occurs because the `sprintf` function is used to copy user-provided input into fixed-size stack buffers without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function writes user controlled data into stack buffers `v5` and `v6` without boundary checks. The sizes of the buffers are not mentioned in the report, but since the vulnerability is triggered by sending an input larger than 512 bytes we can assume the buffers to be smaller than that.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the length of the input parameters (`page` and `mitInterface`) before using them in `sprintf`, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrarily long strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the stack can cause the router to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With carefully crafted overflow data, an attacker can overwrite return addresses on the stack to gain remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/fromRouteStatic` endpoint.
- **URL parameters**: The `page` and `mitInterface` parameters in the URL are the vehicle for injecting the overflow data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, since the endpoint is directly accessible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable routers mentioned are Tenda F1202, FH1202, AC7V1.0, and PW201A.
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a long string via the `page` and `mitInterface` parameters.
- The vulnerability was reported to CVE and CNVD on 2022-06-29.
