Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-21460:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content from `www.oracle.com` is a Critical Patch Update advisory from April 2022, which includes information on many CVEs, including CVE-2022-21460. The content from `security.netapp.com` also explicitly mentions the CVE in relation to multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle MySQL Server.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2022-21460 lies within the "Server: Logging" component of the Oracle MySQL Server.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the logging functionality within MySQL Server. The nature of the vulnerability is not elaborated upon but is described in the NetApp advisory as potentially leading to the unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Oracle's description:** The Oracle advisory states the impact as "None", which does not necessarily mean there is no risk, but it means there is no impact for the affected product listed directly. This indicates a potential weakness in logging that can be triggered and lead to some impact.
*   **NetApp's Description:** NetApp's advisory highlights the potential impacts more clearly:
    *   Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server.
    *   Unauthorized read or modification access to MySQL Server data.
    *   Hang or frequent crashes of MySQL Server (partial or complete DoS).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Oracle's Description**: The Oracle advisory lists the protocol as "MySQL Protocol" and indicates the vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication.
*   **NetApp's Description**: The NetApp advisory states exploitation would require network access and access to the MySQL protocol.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Oracle's Description:** As per the Oracle advisory, the attacker needs to have access to the MySQL protocol to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **NetApp's Description:** The NetApp advisory clarifies that exploitation requires network access and the ability to interact with the MySQL protocol, in addition to requiring the proper access rights within the MySQL configuration

**Summary of extracted information:**
CVE-2022-21460 is a vulnerability within the logging component of Oracle MySQL Server that can be exploited through the MySQL protocol. It is not directly remotely exploitable without authentication, so the attacker needs valid MySQL credentials to be able to reach the vulnerable code. The vulnerability can potentially lead to a range of impacts from unauthorized information disclosure or modification to DoS against affected services. NetApp explicitly states that successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server.
