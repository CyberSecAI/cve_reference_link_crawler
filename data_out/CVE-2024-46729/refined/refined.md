Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect size calculation within a loop in the `dccg35_get_other_enabled_symclk_fe` function in the AMD display driver. The code was using `sizeof(fe_clk_en)` to determine the size of an array, which returns the size in bytes rather than the number of elements. This resulted in the loop iterating beyond the bounds of the `fe_clk_en` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The incorrect size calculation leads to an out-of-bounds read, where the code tries to access memory locations beyond the allocated size of the `fe_clk_en` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Overrun Issues:** As the commit message indicates, this bug can cause an overrun issue, which means reading data from out of bounds. While the provided context doesn't specify the direct impact in terms of security, out-of-bounds reads can lead to crashes or potentially expose sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified by Coverity as an overrun issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the kernel driver and not directly exposed to the user.
- The attack vector would require triggering the vulnerable code path within the `dccg35_get_other_enabled_symclk_fe` function.
- The specific triggers would be dependent on display configurations involving multiple front-ends and stream encoder instances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the AMD display driver in a way that triggers the `dccg35_get_other_enabled_symclk_fe` function and cause the out-of-bounds read condition.
- This likely involves having control over display settings or other parameters that influence how the display driver is utilized.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix replaces `sizeof(fe_clk_en)` with `ARRAY_SIZE(fe_clk_en)`, which correctly calculates the number of elements in the array, resolving the out-of-bounds read issue.
- This issue affects the `dcn35_dccg.c` driver which is part of AMD's display driver.

In summary, the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to an incorrect size calculation in a loop, which could lead to system instability or other issues. The fix addresses this by using the correct way to determine the array size.
