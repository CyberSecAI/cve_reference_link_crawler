Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50926:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of the prefix information length within incoming Destination Advertisement Object (DIO) messages in the RPL-Lite implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read due to an attacker-controlled length parameter in a `memcmp` function call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a crafted DIO message with an invalid prefix length, potentially leading to denial of service or other unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a malicious DIO message to a device running the affected version of Contiki-NG with RPL-Lite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a network position where they can send DIO messages to the targeted device.

**Summary of extracted information:**
The vulnerability is present in the RPL-Lite implementation of Contiki-NG and occurs due to a lack of validation on the length of the IPv6 address prefix field within a DIO message. An attacker can send a crafted message with a length value larger than the allocated buffer, causing a `memcmp` function to read out-of-bounds. The issue has been addressed in the development branch, and a patch is available via the referenced pull request.
