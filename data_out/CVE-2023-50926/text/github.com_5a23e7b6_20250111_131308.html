# Unverified DIO prefix info lengths in RPL-Lite

Moderate

[nfi](/nfi)
published
GHSA-jp4p-fq85-jch2
Feb 14, 2024

## Package

os/net/routing/rpl-lite

## Affected versions

<= 4.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system.

More specifically, the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated, which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently, a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix, causing an out-of-bounds read.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request [#2721](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2721) to patch the system.
