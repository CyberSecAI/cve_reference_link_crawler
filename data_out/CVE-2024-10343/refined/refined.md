Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Beek Widget Extention plugin's shortcode functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes used in the `bwe_cta` shortcode. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. When a user visits a page containing the malicious code, it will execute in the user's browser.
- The injected script can perform various malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `bwe_cta` shortcode.
- An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode with a payload in one of its attributes (e.g., `text`, `url`).
- The crafted shortcode is then added to a WordPress page/post.
- When a user views the affected page, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level permissions or higher on the WordPress site to be able to add or edit posts/pages.
- **Ability to use shortcodes:** The attacker needs the ability to use shortcodes within WordPress content.
