{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer during the parsing of PPT files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PPT file that, when opened by the victim using Hancom Office Show, triggers the overflow. Alternatively, the victim could visit a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PPT file or have the victim visit a malicious web page. User interaction is required (opening the malicious file or visiting the malicious page)."
