{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly outputs user-controlled data into HTML without proper sanitization or escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored XSS",
    "CSRF"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a note, which will execute when other users view that note. A CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to delete a note by tricking the logged-in user to click a link.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript into the note content, which is then stored and displayed to other users.",
    "The attacker crafts a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, deletes a specified note."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "The attacker needs to be able to create a note with malicious JavaScript content.",
    "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a crafted link."
  ]
