Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the `do_save()` component of icms version 7.0.16.
* **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. Specifically, it doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to both code execution and information disclosure. This implies that an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access and modify the system, as well as access sensitive data.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote. The content mentions using BurpSuite to create a CSRF Proof of Concept (POC), indicating that a forged request is crafted by the attacker and sent to the vulnerable application via the user's browser.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting the crafted malicious request to the target server. This often involves social engineering or exploiting other vulnerabilities. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
