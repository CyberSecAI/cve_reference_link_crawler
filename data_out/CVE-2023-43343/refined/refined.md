Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user input within the "Files - Description" field in the Pages Menu of Quick CMS v6.7.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the description field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the application's database. When other users view the page containing this stored content, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing web pages.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
    - Data exfiltration
    - Potentially gaining control over the affected user's session and potentially the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker, with access to the CMS panel, can inject the malicious script into the Description field of files within the "Pages - Files" section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Quick CMS administration panel. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or other vulnerabilities that grant administrative access.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the "Pages - Files" section and modify the description of a file.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is in Quick CMS version 6.7
- The provided XSS payload is: `'"><svg/onload=alert('Description')>`
- The injected payload is executed when a user accesses the web page containing the modified file description.
