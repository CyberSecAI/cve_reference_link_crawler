Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the `wpr_import_templates_kit` AJAX action within the Royal Elementor Addons plugin. This means the function doesn't check if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is that the `wpr_import_templates_kit` AJAX action is accessible to any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges like subscriber-level permissions.
*   **Missing Nonce Checks:**  The code does not validate the nonce, a security token to prevent CSRF attacks. However, this is not the main issue since the user must be authenticated in the first place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Template Import:** An attacker can import preset site configuration templates. This could lead to several consequences:
    *   **Content Overwriting:** Existing site content, including pages, settings and other configurations can be overwritten with the imported template.
    *   **Malicious Content Injection:** The imported templates might contain malicious scripts, images, or settings that could compromise the site or redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   **Site Defacement:** An attacker could alter the site's appearance and functionality, potentially disrupting business operations or reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network via the WordPress AJAX API.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site, but can have minimal privileges.
*   **AJAX Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the vulnerable `wpr_import_templates_kit` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target WordPress site, even a subscriber account will work.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
