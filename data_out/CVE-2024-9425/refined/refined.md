Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9425

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `ad_tax_image` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied attributes used in the `ad_tax_image` shortcode, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive user data

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `ad_tax_image` shortcode.
- An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode with XSS payload within the attributes.
- This crafted shortcode is then stored in the database, likely via a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to WordPress.
- This access level allows the attacker to create or modify content (posts, pages) where the shortcode can be included.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.0.9.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.1.0 of the plugin.
- The fix includes applying "wp standard security sanitizations and escaping output".
- The vulnerable code is located in `wp-advanced-taxonomy-image.php` file
