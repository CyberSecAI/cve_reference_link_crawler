- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient escaping on the user-supplied `kento_pvc_geo` parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can append additional SQL queries to existing queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the `kento_pvc_geo` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
