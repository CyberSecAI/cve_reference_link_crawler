- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly escape content when embedding posts, specifically when using the "Post Carousel (CoBlocks)" or "Posts (CoBlocks)" blocks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied content, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when the affected block is rendered.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection. This can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled, making it more severe in multisite setups.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the capability to publish posts (Editor role or higher) creates a post with malicious code (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) and publishes it. When a user adds a "Post Carousel (CoBlocks)" or "Posts (CoBlocks)" block to a page or post, the stored XSS is triggered when the malicious content is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Editor role permissions or higher on the WordPress site, meaning they have the ability to create and publish posts.
