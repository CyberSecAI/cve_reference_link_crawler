- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Concurrent execution using shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition in video codec.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation of the race condition within the video codec.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed, but user interaction is not required.
