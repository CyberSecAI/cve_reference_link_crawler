Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-10114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The provided documents indicate that CVE-2017-10114 is an unspecified vulnerability within the JavaFX component of Oracle Java SE. The root cause is not detailed but is located within JavaFX which handles graphics rendering in java.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unspecified vulnerability in JavaFX component leading to a critical rating.
- Insufficient access control checks in various components, such as `ServiceRegistry` (ImageIO), `AsynchronousChannelGroupImpl` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- Timing attacks in DSA and ECDSA implementations.
- Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization in `CodeSource` and `BasicAttribute`.
- Insecure XML parsing in `wsdlimport`.
- Integer overflows in range check loop predicates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a takeover of the Java process.
- Partial denial of service (DoS) of the Java application.
- Unauthorized reading or modification of data accessible to the Java process.
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks (remote exploitation).
- Exploitation through untrusted Java applets or Java Web Start applications.
- Exploitation through malformed data supplied to vulnerable APIs.
- Physical access (specifically for deployment issues).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable system.
- Ability to influence data processed by the Java application.
- In the case of local exploits, the attacker needs to have the required permissions for local access.
- In some cases, user interaction is needed, for example, to run a malicious applet.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by updating Oracle Java SE to version 7u151 or 8u141 (depending on the version used) and IcedTea to versions 7.2.6.11 or 3.5.0.
- Red Hat also released a security advisory (RHSA-2017:1790 and RHSA-2017:1791) to address this and other related vulnerabilities in their Oracle Java packages.
- Oracle's Critical Patch Update (CPU) advisory for July 2017 also addresses this vulnerability along with many others.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple products including Oracle Java SE, Oracle Java SE Embedded, and Oracle JRockit, as well as various NetApp products, and products utilizing the vulnerable java libraries.
- Debian also released a security advisory (DSA 4005-1) for OpenJFX which addresses CVE-2017-10086 and CVE-2017-10114.
- The vulnerability may affect deployments that load and run untrusted code, but also some server deployments can be affected by malformed data.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-10114 is an unspecified vulnerability in the JavaFX component of Oracle Java SE that can be exploited in multiple ways. The provided documents indicate that an update of the affected software is required to mitigate the vulnerability.
