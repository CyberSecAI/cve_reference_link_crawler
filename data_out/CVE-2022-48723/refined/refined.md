Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2022-48723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reference count leak in the `uniphier_spi_probe()` function within the Linux kernel's SPI driver for Uniphier SoCs. Specifically, in several error handling paths of the function, the reference counts of `dma_rx` and `dma_tx` objects were not decremented properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a reference count leak. When either `dma_get_slave_caps()` or `devm_spi_register_master()` returns an error code, the function fails to release the references held by `dma_rx` and `dma_tx` objects leading to memory leaks

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeated allocation failures due to the leak could eventually lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the device probe, specifically when the SPI driver is initialized. An attacker would need to trigger the error conditions within the driver by possibly providing a malformed or incorrect device configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the capability to influence or control the device initialization process and trigger the specific error conditions, often requiring root or administrative privileges or the ability to load and unload kernel modules.
