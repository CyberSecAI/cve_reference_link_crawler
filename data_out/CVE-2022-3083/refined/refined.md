Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Landis+Gyr E850 (ZMQ200) web application relies on the value of a session cookie for navigation without proper validation or integrity checks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity (CWE-784):** The application trusts the cookie's value without verifying its authenticity or integrity. This allows an attacker to manipulate the cookie.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the affected user, rendering the web application inaccessible for that user.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by modifying the session cookie value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to modify the cookie, which requires the attacker to have local access.
    *   The attacker also requires a user to interact with the application after the cookie has been modified.
    *   The vulnerability has low attack complexity and requires low privileges.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
