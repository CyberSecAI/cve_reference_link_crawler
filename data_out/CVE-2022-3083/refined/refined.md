Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The Landis+Gyr E850 (ZMQ200) web application relies on the value of session cookies for navigation without proper validation or integrity checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity (CWE-784):** The application uses cookies to manage user sessions and navigation but does not validate or ensure the integrity of these cookies, allowing an attacker to modify them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial-of-Service:** If an attacker modifies the session cookie, the web application becomes inaccessible for the end-user associated with the modified cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited by modifying the value of the session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs local access to the network where the device is located.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the cookie associated with a user's session.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of web application cookies.
