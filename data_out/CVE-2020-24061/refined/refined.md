Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24061:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization on the KASDA KW5515 router's web interface. Specifically, the "URL Filter" functionality does not filter or encode special characters, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, as malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the web page.
  *  **HTML Injection:** The vulnerability also allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML code, which could be used to alter the appearance of the page or perform other malicious actions.
  * **Lack of input sanitization:**  The web interface fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "URL Filter" functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  *   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session when they access the router's admin panel.
  *   **Session hijacking:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
  *   **Phishing:** It is possible to modify the page to perform phishing attacks against the user of the router.
  * **Router Misconfiguration**: Attackers could potentially use JavaScript to modify router settings.

**Attack vectors:**
  *   The attack vector is through the router's web-based administration interface. Specifically, the "URL Filter" setting.
  * The attacker needs access to the router's login page and must be authenticated to access the "URL Filter" setting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  *   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have some way to access the admin panel.
  *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid login credentials to access the router's admin panel.
  *  **Knowledge of the vulnerable setting:** The attacker needs to know the specific setting "URL Filter" is vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on the KASDA KW5515 router with firmware version KW5515\_Linux\_V1.7 and SDK version 4.3.1.0 (Mar 6 2019).
*   The reported payload was `<svg onload=alert(1)>`.

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor (Kasda) on Jul 8, 2020, but they did not respond, which led to the public disclosure.
