Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10300:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `viewid` parameter within the `view-enquiry.php` file of the PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability, where unsanitized user input is used to construct SQL queries. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Integrity:** The attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Availability:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the system's operation by manipulating the database, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the server.
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter `viewid` is passed via an HTTP GET request, making it easily accessible for manipulation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** Successful authentication to the admin panel is required before exploiting the SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `PHPGurukul Medical Card Generation System 1.0`.
- The specific vulnerable files are `/mcgs/admin/view-card-detail.php` and `/mcgs/admin/view-enquiry.php`.
