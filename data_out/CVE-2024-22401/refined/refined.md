Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Nextcloud Guests app where the allowed apps list for guest users could be reset by any user. This occurs due to insufficient permission checks when resetting the allowed apps list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper access control when resetting the allowed app list for guest users. Any user could trigger this reset.
*   **URL Path Decoding:** The patch for this vulnerability also includes a fix for checking the app whitelist using the decoded path instead of the raw URL path. This suggests that the vulnerability was also related to how paths were handled when checking for allowed apps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation/Information Disclosure:** By resetting the allowed app list, a malicious user could enable apps that were not intended for guest use, granting them access to functionality and data they shouldn't have. This could lead to both information disclosure and unauthorized actions.
*   **Scope Change:** The CVSS score indicates a "Scope Changed" impact, meaning the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect resources beyond the originally intended scope of the guest user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is "Network" (AV:N), indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network connection.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L), suggesting that exploitation is relatively easy to carry out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that any authenticated user, including a guest user, can perform the attack.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker requires some user interaction (UI:R), although the exact nature of this interaction is not specified in detail (it seems like the user needs to make a request to reset the allowed apps list).

**Summary of Fixes:**

The provided information references a pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/guests/pull/1082](https://github.com/nextcloud/guests/pull/1082)) that includes the following fixes:
*   Use decoded path to check the app whitelist.
