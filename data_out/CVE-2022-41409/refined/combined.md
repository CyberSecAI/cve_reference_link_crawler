| Bug Description Hi, we find 151 [input files](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/files/9348416/pcre2-hangs.zip) and `pcre2test` could not terminate in 60 minutes while processing them, which may trigger some dead loops.  We select one [simplest input file](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/files/9348433/simplied-case.zip) (decompress it) to analyze the bug and the results of our analysis are as follows. (Maybe there are other situations.) Bug Analysis We find an endless looping may in `pcre2test.c:6860` With the [input](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/files/9348433/simplied-case.zip) (decompress it).  ``` -- \[X]{-10}  ```  The relevant code snippet is as follows.  ```     li = strtol((const char *)p, &endptr, 10);     i = (int32_t)li;     if (i-- == 0) {// ...}     // ...     replen = CAST8VAR(q) - start_rep;     needlen += replen * i;        if (needlen >= dbuffer_size)       {       // ... 6860: while (needlen >= dbuffer_size) dbuffer_size *= 2;       // ...       } ```  1. `p` = "-10", `li` = `i` = -10 2. With `i--`, `i` = -11 3. With `replen = CAST8VAR(q) - start_rep;`, `replen` = 1 4. With initial value 10 and `needlen += replen * i`, `needlen` = -1 = 2 ^ 64 -1, as type(`needlen`) = `size_t` 5. Then an endless looping occurs in line: 6860.    * In fact, the `while` entry condition is vulnerable. With needlen ∈ [ 2 ^ 63, 2 ^ 64), the `while` is very easy to trap into endless looping.  How to reproduce  1. Download the pcre2 source code with the official link and build it.    * `./autogen.sh`    * `CC=gcc CXX=g++ ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=...`    * `make -j 8`    * `make install` 2. Executing prec2test with the provided input files    * Decompress the zip to get all the input files.    * `cd <your install directory>`    * `./bin/pcre2test <any input file in the zip>` |

| Thank you for the report and diagnosis. This was, of course, a simple oversight in pcre2test. I have committed a patch that gives an error if a negative repetition count is encountered. |
