- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiSandbox RPC API uses a small space of random values for generating session IDs, making them predictable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Predictable session IDs due to insufficient randomness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with some knowledge of the device's state could predict valid session IDs, potentially gaining unauthorized access or information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the FortiSandbox RPC API's session ID generation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs some prior knowledge about the state of the device and a valid way to interact with the API. This vulnerability is exploitable from the network, requires low privileges, and no user interaction.
