The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45858.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of an unprotected `eval` function within the `parse_token` method of the `ValidatorsAttr` class in the `guardrails/guardrails/validatorsattr.py` file. This function is used to parse arguments of a validator from an XML file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') (CWE-95).
- Unprotected use of the `eval` function.
- Lack of sanitization or validation of inputs provided to the `eval` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the program's machine when a malicious XML file is loaded by the victim. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary python code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Loading a specially crafted malicious XML file that contains python code within a validator's argument wrapped in curly braces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious XML file.
- The victim must load this malicious XML file using the vulnerable `guardrails` library.
