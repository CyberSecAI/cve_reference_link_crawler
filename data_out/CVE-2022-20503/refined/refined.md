Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on guest users' ability to configure WiFi using QR codes. Specifically, the `WifiDppConfiguratorActivity` was not being restricted for guest users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** Guest users, who should have limited privileges, were able to access and use the `WifiDppConfiguratorActivity`, which is intended for configuring WiFi via QR codes.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** This could lead to a guest user potentially modifying network settings or gaining unauthorized access to a WiFi network that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker (guest user) could potentially:
- Configure a device to connect to a malicious Wi-Fi network.
- Disrupt legitimate users' network connectivity.
- Gain unauthorized access to the network and potentially other devices on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a guest user accessing the `WifiDppConfiguratorActivity`.
- This can be done by navigating the settings menu or similar access points where the WiFi QR code option is present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest user on the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the device's settings menu or the relevant UI components to trigger the `WifiDppConfiguratorActivity`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves restricting guest users from accessing the `WifiDppConfiguratorActivity`.
- The commit message clarifies that the fix includes not showing the activity if the current user is a guest.
- Manual tests and RoboTests were used to verify the fix.
