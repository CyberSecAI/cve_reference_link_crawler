  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `image_copy_plane` function due to incorrect handling of odd height in the `doubleweave` filter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted video file using the `doubleweave` filter in FFmpeg.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted video file to be processed by FFmpeg with the doubleweave filter."
