- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references during the parsing of XML files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application's XML parser does not properly restrict XML External Entity (XXE) references. This allows the parser to access and embed the content from a specified URI into the XML document.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by having a user open a malicious XML file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the crafted XML content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XML file or have a user visit a malicious web page, user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker is a remote attacker in terms of network position.
