  "cve": "CVE-2023-52464",
  "description": "The provided content indicates a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) subsystem, specifically within the driver for Cavium ThunderX processors (drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c). The vulnerability is due to the incorrect use of `strncat()` which can lead to out-of-bounds string access.",
  "affected_component": "drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the use of the `strncat()` function where the third argument was intended to represent the size of the destination buffer, but was instead being used as the length of the source buffer. This misunderstanding of how `strncat()` functions leads to missing bounds check, potentially causing buffer overflows.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds string access",
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is potentially out-of-bounds memory access, possibly leading to denial of service, information leaks, or privilege escalation depending on the specific context and the data overwritten.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "The vulnerability can be triggered by the error handling routine in the `thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr`, `thunderx_ocx_lnk_threaded_isr`, and `thunderx_l2c_threaded_isr` functions when concatenating error messages."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need the ability to trigger error conditions that result in the affected code being executed, such as by causing an error during EDAC operations."
