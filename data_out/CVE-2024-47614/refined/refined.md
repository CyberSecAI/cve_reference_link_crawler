Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47614:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the number of directives that can be applied to a single field in a GraphQL query. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious query with an excessive number of directives, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation or sanitization for the number of directives on a field.
- The `async-graphql` library did not enforce any limits on the number of directives applied to a single field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Service disruption: The server may become unresponsive or extremely slow, potentially leading to downtime.
- Resource exhaustion: Excessive use of server resources, such as CPU and memory, could negatively impact other services running on the same infrastructure.
- User experience degradation: Users may experience delays or failures when accessing the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker sends a specially crafted GraphQL query over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the server.
- No special privileges are needed.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability introduces a `limit_directives` method in the `SchemaBuilder` to set a maximum limit on the number of directives allowed on a single field.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The affected versions are below 7.0.10 and the patch is included in version 7.0.10 and later.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by either upgrading to the patched version or by using `SchemaBuilder.limit_directives` to limit the number of directives.
