The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26797.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential buffer overflow in the `map_hw_resources` function within the AMD display driver. The function accesses arrays using an index that could exceed the array bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The code accesses the `dml2->v20.scratch.dml_to_dc_pipe_mapping.disp_cfg_to_stream_id` and `dml2->v20.scratch.dml_to_dc_pipe_mapping.disp_cfg_to_plane_id` arrays using an index `i` without proper bounds checking. If `i` is greater than or equal to `__DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__`, it can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** An attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory regions if the index goes out of bounds. This could lead to system instability, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution if exploited carefully.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a malformed display configuration. By manipulating the `mode_support_info->DPPPerSurface` parameters, an attacker can influence the loop variable `i` to go out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the display configuration which would likely require local access to the system or through a compromised userland process.
