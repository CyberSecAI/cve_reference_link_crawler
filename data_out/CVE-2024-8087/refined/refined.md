Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `/ecommerce/popup_Item.php` interface, specifically the `id` parameter, which allows for unauthorized SQL union injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection via the `id` parameter in `popup_Item.php`. The application does not sanitize or validate user input before incorporating it into a SQL query.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The vulnerability is described as an "unauthorized sql union population" indicating that the application does not properly restrict access to the data being queried.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the proof of concept that retrieves the database name.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** A successful SQL injection can pave the way for more advanced attacks such as data manipulation, privilege escalation or even remote code execution depending on the database server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to `popup_Item.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how SQL injection works, specifically SQL union injections, to craft a malicious request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/ecommerce/popup_Item.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The proof of concept uses the following payload: `1 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,database(),20`
- The attacker can use this payload to retrieve the database name, as shown in the provided screenshot.
