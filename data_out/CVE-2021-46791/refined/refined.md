- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation during parsing of the System Management Mode (SMM) binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A maliciously crafted SMM executable binary can corrupt Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) user application memory which may lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A maliciously crafted SMM executable binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted SMM executable binary to the system.
