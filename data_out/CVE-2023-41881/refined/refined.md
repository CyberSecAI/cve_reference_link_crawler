    "description": "When a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from that collaboration) should be deleted. This is partly to manage data properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect, where if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases.",

      "CWE-200",

    "impact": "Potential exposure of results from a deleted collaboration to users of a new collaboration if both have the same ID.",
