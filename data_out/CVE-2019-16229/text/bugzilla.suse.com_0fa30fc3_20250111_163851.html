| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1150469#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-09-12 07:58:41 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16229  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_interrupt.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-16229> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16229> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/9/487> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1150469#c1)  Michal Hocko   2019-09-12 09:37:36 UTC  ``` I can see a flood of CVEs like this one and I again feel this is a CVE process abuse. Let's see what the potentially failing allocation is tbl_size = nr_node_ids * sizeof(wq->numa_pwq_tbl[0]); kzalloc(sizeof(*wq) + tbl_size, GFP_KERNEL);  wq is 320B, pool_workqueue is 256B, take nr_node_ids something real, say less than 100 and we are still under 4KB. The memory allocator simply does't fail those allocations unless there is a very special conditions - e.g. the caller is an OOM victim. I am really skeptical that an initialization call is called in such a context.  That being said, adding a check for the failure makes sense but assigning a CVE and make it a big deal is just dubious to say the least. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1150469#c2)  Borislav Petkov   2019-09-13 12:57:30 UTC  ``` I agree. Marcus, can we kill those CVEs? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1150469#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2019-10-10 05:56:43 UTC  ``` I filed a rejection request with Mitre. This might take a while. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1150469#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2019-10-11 07:07:17 UTC  ``` Now marked as disputed. ``` |  |
