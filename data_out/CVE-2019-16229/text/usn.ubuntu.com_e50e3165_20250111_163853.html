## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18811](/security/CVE-2019-18811))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

It was discovered that the IO uring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly perform credentials checks in certain situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges.

([CVE-2019-19241](/security/CVE-2019-19241))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel on x86

platforms when keeping track of which process was assigned control of the

FPU. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-19602](/security/CVE-2019-19602))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker

could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-19947](/security/CVE-2019-19947))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
