- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CollectChat plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. This malicious script will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the plugin's settings page, allowing for actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on the victim's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the plugin's settings page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=collectchat`). By crafting a specific POST request with malicious JavaScript code in the `collectchat-plugin-settings[script]` parameter, an attacker can inject the XSS payload
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or have high-level privileges. The attack requires the user to visit the affected page.
