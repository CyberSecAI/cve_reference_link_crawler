### Description

A memory corruption vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS due to a crafted packet through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cloud NGFW | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.2 | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.1 | < 11.1.3 | >= 11.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 11.0 | < 11.0.4-h5, < 11.0.6 | >= 11.0.4-h5, >= 11.0.6 |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | < 10.2.9-h11, < 10.2.10-h4, < 10.2.11 | >= 10.2.9-h11, >= 10.2.10-h4, >= 10.2.11 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | None | All |
| Prisma Access | None | All |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue affects only PAN-OS configurations where all of the following are true:

\* Threat Prevention is enabled.

\* The Threat Prevention signature 86467 ("Possible Domain Fronting Detection-SNI") is enabled on an Anti-Spyware profile.

\* This setting is enabled: Device > Setup > Session > Decryption Settings > SSL Decryption Settings > Send handshake messages to CTD for inspection.

### Severity: HIGH, Suggested Urgency: MODERATE

CVSS-B:
8.2 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:L/U:Amber](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:L/U:Amber))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in 10.2.9-h11, 10.2.10-h4, PAN-OS 10.2.11, PAN-OS 11.0.4-h5, PAN-OS 11.0.6, PAN-OS 11.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Customers can block attacks for this vulnerability by disabling this setting: Device > Setup Session > Decryption Settings > SSL Decryption Settings > Send handshake messages to CTD for inspection.

Customers with a Threat Prevention subscription, who want to keep domain fronting detection enabled, can block attacks for this vulnerability by enabling Threat ID 94971 (introduced in Applications and Threats content version 8854).
