- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in PAN-OS software due to a crafted packet through the data plane.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787) leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can crash PAN-OS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts can cause PAN-OS to enter maintenance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: A maliciously crafted packet sent through the data plane.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable PAN-OS device. No authentication is required. The specific configuration prerequisites are that Threat Prevention is enabled, the Threat Prevention signature 86467 is enabled on an Anti-Spyware profile, and the 'Send handshake messages to CTD for inspection' setting is enabled.
