- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An exponential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `markdown-link-extractor` npm package. The vulnerability stems from a poorly crafted regular expression used in the module's exported function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is an inefficient regular expression that can lead to exponential backtracking when processing certain inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause a denial of service (DoS). By providing a specially crafted string, the attacker can cause the vulnerable application to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker can supply arbitrary input to the vulnerable function in `markdown-link-extractor`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the markdown-link-extractor module. This might be through a web application or any other means where the module is used to process input. The provided PoC shows a string that, when supplied, will trigger the vulnerability: `'![' + '"\\\\"'.repeat(i)`.
