Based on the provided information, this content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection vulnerability in the `add_leave_non_user.php` file of the SourceCodester Record Management System version 1.0. Specifically, the `LSS` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists because user-supplied input (`LSS` parameter) is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can access, delete, or modify sensitive data stored in the database, including customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to information, and potential system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `add_leave_non_user.php` file.
- The `LSS` parameter in the POST data is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL payloads to insert via the `LSS` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from `add_leave_non_user.php` is:
```php
$LSS=$_POST['LSS'];
//...
mysqli_query($conn,"insert into service_credits (from_date,to_date,employeeID,LE_vacation,LE_sick,LS_vacation,LS_sick,B_vacation,B_sick,total) values('$from','$to','$emp_id','$LEV','$LES','$LSV','$LSS','$BV','$BS','$total')")or die(mysqli_error());
```
The code directly uses the POST parameter `$LSS` within the SQL query without any sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.

The provided sqlmap output further demonstrates the exploitability of the `LSS` parameter with both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
