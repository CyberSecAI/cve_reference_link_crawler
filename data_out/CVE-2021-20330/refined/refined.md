- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `applyOps` command bypasses certain input validation checks that are normally performed on operations. This is intentional, as `applyOps` is designed to mimic oplog application, where the primary does all validation, and secondaries apply changes without validation. However, this design allows users with basic CRUD permissions to bypass validation checks by using `applyOps` with malformed oplog entries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in the `applyOps` command. The command does not perform sufficient checks on the provided oplog entries, which can lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) on secondary nodes by sending malformed oplog entries via the `applyOps` command, potentially crashing them.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with basic CRUD permissions on a replicated collection can execute the `applyOps` command with specially crafted oplog entries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions on a replicated collection within a MongoDB deployment. This is not a highly privileged access.
