- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low level of access complexity (AC:L). It requires a low privileged attacker (PR:L) to inject malicious scripts. User interaction is also required as the victim needs to trigger the XSS by visiting the page with the stored malicious script (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to inject malicious scripts into the AEM system. The attacker would need to induce a victim to interact with the injected content.
