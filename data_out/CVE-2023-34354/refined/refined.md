- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization of user-supplied parameters used to populate the web interface's branding, specifically when handling requests to `/cgi-bin/MANGA/upload_brand.cgi`. The `brand_web_name` and `web_link_url` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. Although some basic javascript escaping is performed, it does not prevent XSS in the context where these parameters are used.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application insufficiently sanitizes user-controlled input before it is stored and subsequently displayed in the web interface. Specifically, while a blocklist is applied to `brand_web_name`, it does not prevent the injection of XSS payloads into the context of the `leftmenu_main.html` template.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a user accessing the router's web interface, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must make an authenticated HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/MANGA/upload_brand.cgi` with the `mode` parameter set to `api` and a crafted payload in the `brand_web_name` and `web_link_url` parameters. The OEM must also be set to VISLINK.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the web interface with write privileges in order to upload the malicious branding data.
