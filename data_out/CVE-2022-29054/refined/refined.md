- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing cryptographic step in the functions that encrypt DHCP and DNS keys (ddns-key or n-mhae-key).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing cryptographic steps [CWE-325] during key encryption, leading to weak encryption of DHCP and DNS keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in possession of the encrypted key can decipher it.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to obtain the encrypted keys from the FortiOS or FortiProxy configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access (AV:L) and low privileges (PR:L) to the system to obtain the encrypted keys.
