The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48939.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of scheduling points within the BPF batch operations. These batch operations, when processing large amounts of data, could lead to soft lockups and tasks getting blocked for extended periods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of scheduling points in `generic_map_delete_batch`, `generic_map_update_batch` and `generic_map_lookup_batch` functions in `kernel/bpf/syscall.c`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Soft lockups
- Tasks blocked for long durations (e.g., over 140 seconds)
- System instability

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering BPF batch operations with large datasets

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute BPF batch operations on the system.
