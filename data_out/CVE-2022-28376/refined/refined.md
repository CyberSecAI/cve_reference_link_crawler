{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the pre-generation of a static password for the 'verizon' engineering account in both the IDU (InDoor Unit) and ODU (OutDoor Unit) of the Verizon 5G LVSKIHP modem/router.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a static, pre-generated password instead of a unique, randomly generated one.",
      "The static password is derived from a predictable combination of the device's serial number and model number via a SHA256 hash."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use the static 'verizon' engineering account password to gain unauthorized access to the device's engineering interfaces on both the IDU and ODU. This allows for the potential to execute arbitrary code, modify device settings, and potentially gain full root access, leading to complete control over the device. The engineering interface also allows bypassing security restrictions and device hardening on the consumer interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the device's web interface via the ODU at 10.0.0.1 and the IDU at 10.0.0.2."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires knowledge or discovery of the method used to generate the static 'verizon' password, which is a combination of the device's serial number and model number, then use the derived password to gain access to the engineering interface. Physical access to the device is not required."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided write-up details the process of discovering the password generation algorithm by reverse-engineering the firmware. It describes how this vulnerability can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the engineering interface on both the IDU and ODU, and how that access can further be exploited to gain root access on both components through other vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-28374 and CVE-2022-28373 respectively). The report shows that the engineering password was calculated by taking the SHA256 of the serial number of the device concatenated with the model number, and then taking the first 7 and the last 7 characters of that hash. The write-up provides more context and detail than the basic CVE description."
