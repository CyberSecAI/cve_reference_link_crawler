The provided content is related to a fix for a warning message in the Linux kernel, specifically in the `mtk-cmdq-mailbox.c` driver. The warning occurs due to the use of `pm_runtime_get_sync()`. This function can return 1 when the power management runtime state is active. The code was updated to only trigger a warning when the function returns a value less than 0.

This change is not directly related to a security vulnerability. It fixes a false positive warning and improves code robustness.

Therefore:

**Root cause of the issue:** The `WARN_ON` macro was triggered when `pm_runtime_get_sync()` returned 1, which is a valid active state and not an error condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  No actual vulnerability exists, just an incorrect check triggering a warning.

**Impact of exploitation:** No exploitation. The warning message was a false positive.

**Attack vectors:** Not applicable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not applicable.
