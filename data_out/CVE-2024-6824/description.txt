The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'check_temp_validity' and 'update_template_title' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.38. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary content and update post and page titles.
