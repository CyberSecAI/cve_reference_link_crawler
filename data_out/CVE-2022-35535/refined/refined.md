**Multiple Command Injection Vulnerabilities in WAVLINK Routers**

The provided document describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities affecting WAVLINK AC1200 routers (specifically models WN572HP3, WN533A8, WN530H4, WN535G3, and WN531P3). These vulnerabilities arise due to insufficient input validation in several CGI scripts.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause across all identified vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization in various CGI scripts (`adm.cgi`, `api.cgi`, `firewall.cgi`, `login.cgi`, `nas.cgi`, `qos.cgi`, and `wireless.cgi`). User-supplied data from POST requests are used directly in shell commands without proper filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is command injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by including special characters (e.g., `;`) within user-supplied parameters.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The core problem is the absence of input validation and sanitization on user-supplied parameters. This allows for command injection by injecting shell metacharacters into various input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected router.
* **Full Router Control:**  This level of access could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Complete control of the device, including settings modification
    *   Network reconnaissance and attacks on other devices within the network.
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Malware installation.
    *   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities by crafting malicious HTTP POST requests to vulnerable CGI scripts with injected commands in specific parameters.
* **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities are exposed via the web interface of the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network connectivity to the router's web interface. This may be from the local network or, in some cases, from the internet if remote management is enabled.
* **Authentication (in some cases):** Most of the vulnerabilities require the attacker to be authenticated to the router's web interface (except the login.cgi vulnerability).
