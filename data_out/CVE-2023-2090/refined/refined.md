The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input in the `id` GET parameter of the `/employee_gatepass/admin/maintenance/view_designation.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server depending on the database system and its configuration.
    - Cause denial of service (e.g., with the sleep function).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests.
- The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No specific privileges or prior access is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The content provides two example payloads:
  -  A time-based blind SQL injection payload (`id=1' and (select 2 from (select(sleep(10)))x) and 'x'='x`) demonstrating the vulnerability. The server's response is delayed by 10 seconds.
  - A union-based SQL injection payload (`id=-1' union all select null,concat(0x35363738,0x65666768),null,null,null,null-- -`) demonstrating the ability to inject and retrieve data.
- The content also includes example HTTP requests and screenshots demonstrating the successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
