### **[warpspin](/warpspin)** commented [Nov 16, 2022](#issue-1451633191) • edited Loading

| Cpanel::JSON::XS Version 4.32 (I do not know if this is new behaviour, haven't tested older versions):  If passed invalid JSON of the form "[{sometext}]" in relaxed mode, the module will only sometimes give the correct character offset, sometimes throw UTF-8 errors, sometimes segfault and sometimes let the process hang forever.  Perl script to reproduce:  ``` use Cpanel::JSON::XS;  our $json_decoder = Cpanel::JSON::XS->new->allow_nonref->relaxed;   my $data = '[{foobarfoobar}]'; eval {     $result = $json_decoder->decode($data); }; if( $@ ) {     warn $@; }  ```  Funny thing is, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Save the script as "test.pl" and then start it in a loop from bash:  ``` for i in {1..50}; do perl test.pl; done  ```  (looping from bash is important. Simply running the test in a loop from within the SAME perl interpreter does not change the results - it will either work, or instantly have an error, but if you loop from bash you see the behaviour is indeterministic).  Tested on Mac OS 12.6.1 with Perl 5.34 as well as Debian Linux with Perl 5.32.1, the result will be something like this:  ``` Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected end of string) in subroutine entry at test.pl line 8. ':' expected, at character offset 2075668 (before "") at test.pl line 8. ':' expected, at character offset 2084867 (before "") at test.pl line 8. ':' expected, at character offset 2090145 (before "") at test.pl line 8. ':' expected, at character offset 2075109 (before "") at test.pl line 8.

':' expected, at character offset 10793 (before "") at test.pl line 8.  ```  Please note sometimes there will segfaults in this, as well as sometimes it will just hang forever. Shorter strings seem to cause hangs more often, while longer strings usually have a larger share of segfaults.  Sorry for this very weird bug report, couldn't manage to to make a simpler, deterministic test for this. |
