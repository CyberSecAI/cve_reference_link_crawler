Based on the provided information, both commits address the same vulnerability related to `userfaultfd` and huge pages in the Linux kernel.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect order of operations within the `UFFDIO_MOVE` functionality when handling huge pages. Specifically, the `src_folio`'s mapping and index were being updated before ensuring the folio was unpinned and the page table was cleared. This could lead to failures during swapout/migration processes and potentially cause memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect ordering of operations during `UFFDIO_MOVE` on huge pages.
- Modification of `src_folio`'s mapping and index before ensuring it's unpinned, potentially causing conflicts during swapout or migration

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Failure of swapout and migration processes.
- Potential memory corruption due to inconsistencies in page management.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the `UFFDIO_MOVE` ioctl on a `userfaultfd` with huge pages involved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the `UFFDIO_MOVE` operation. This usually implies having the ability to create `userfaultfd` file descriptors and manage memory mappings.
- The attacker needs to be able to control memory regions which use huge pages.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix ensures that the `src_folio`'s mapping and index are updated *after* the page table is cleared and it is confirmed that the folio isn't pinned.
- The fix was initially introduced in commit `d7a08838ab74` but the fix missed the huge-page case, which these commits addresses.
- Both commits `df5f6e683e7f21a15d8be6e7a0c7a46436963ebe` and `c0205eaf3af9f5db14d4b5ee4abacf4a583c3c50` represent the same fix, but applied to different branches.
