The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express – Email Marketing, Newsletters, Automation for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized API access due to a missing capability check in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to access the API (provided it is enabled) and add, edit, and delete audience users.
