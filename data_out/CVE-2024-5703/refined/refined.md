Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `Email Subscribers by Icegram Express` plugin's REST API. Specifically, the `handle_generate_rest_api_key_request` and `handle_delete_rest_api_key_request` functions lack proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the API endpoints responsible for managing audience users (add, edit, delete).
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Authenticated users with subscriber-level access (or higher) can bypass intended restrictions and interact with the API, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to add, edit, and delete audience users within the plugin's database. This can disrupt marketing campaigns, manipulate user data, and potentially inject malicious content.
*  **Loss of Data Integrity:** Unauthorized modifications to user data can result in data corruption and loss of integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the plugin's REST API endpoints.
*   **Authentication Required:** Attackers must have an authenticated session with a WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Minimum Privilege:** The attacker needs to have a subscriber-level user role or higher.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 5.7.27 of the plugin, with the addition of a capability check (`ES_Common::ig_es_can_access( 'settings' )`).
*   The `check_ajax_referer()` function, while present, doesn't prevent the exploitation due to the lack of a permission check before this function is called.
*  The vulnerable functions are `handle_generate_rest_api_key_request` and `handle_delete_rest_api_key_request` in the `class-es-rest-api-admin.php` file.

In summary, this is an **authorization bypass vulnerability** allowing users with low privileges to access and manipulate sensitive data through the plugin's REST API.
