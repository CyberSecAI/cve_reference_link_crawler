# The importance of responsible security disclosures

Posted:
12/08/2022

|
By:
Nick Nolen, Sr. Director, Threat & Vulnerability Management and Jason Ferguson, Director, Product Security

![IT professional analyzing computer data on three monitors](/globalassets/media/blog/2022/it-pro-3-monitors.png)

We say it time and time again, because it bears repeating: ConnectWise is committed to security as a top priority. Security requires transparency. At IT Nation Connect, Patrick Beggs, our CISO, reiterated this commitment and discussed our work to build security-minded principles into all phases of our product development, service considerations, and communication processes. We know transparency about these processes will help strengthen trust with our partners, awareness in the industry, and the overall posture of the community.

We want to showcase a bit of our approach using a recent example spanning the past couple months. On October 16, 2022, ConnectWise was informed by a security researcher about a potential vulnerability, regarding an issue that could allow an attacker to spoof a relay into another host's installer in versions 22.7 and below of ConnectWise Control client. We began investigating right away and engaged with the researcher within 72 hours to connect further about the findings. On October 21, 2022, we released a remediated version of Control (22.8.10013) and referenced the changes in the product’s release notes as part of our standard practices. In alignment with our thresholds and standards, a broad-sweeping security advisory or alert was not released for this vulnerability.

As is common knowledge, best practices in the industry point to using responsible disclosure paths to avoid imposing unnecessary panic and risks across the entire community. We are still seeing several publications surrounding this research, as well as other non-disclosed issues that do not pose a threat, and are still finding the same outcome that there is no new risk beyond that of threat actors using remote control software for access, which is always present and nothing novel.

In this instance, an independent third-party firm, Huntress, has reviewed the research disclosed online publicly, connected with both the ConnectWise Product Security Response Team and the researcher. Huntress has publicly [supported](https://old.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/yrkhs2/connectwise_control_possible_vulnerability/ivv4z3b/) our assessments of the severity, confirmed the patch we released successfully remediated the reported issue.  Huntress noted that they have seen social engineering and phishing attempts utilizing ConnectWise Control but agreed that they are not seeing any exploitation attempts against a potential vulnerability.  The team at Huntress issued [a full technical write-up](https://www.huntress.com/blog/clearing-the-air-overblown-claims-of-vulnerabilities-exploits-severity) of their findings and we commend them on their continued willingness to practice responsible disclosure openly and honestly and collaboratively work with us for the betterment of the community.

**To be clear, at this time we have no indication the behavior reported above is being abused in the wild, and no known security incidents occurred as a result.** While the issue reported may bear some resemblance to ongoing phishing and social engineering campaigns, there is no correlation between the two; our release fully resolved the issue.

## **Additional insight on our security approach**

As ConnectWise issues updates to our products and services, it is common practice for us to reference the changes in our release notes. For security fixes that are identified as being a moderate or high risk, we also post updates to our [Security Bulletins](/company/trust/security-bulletins) page, which features an RSS feed to subscribe to updates. Alongside our Security Advisory Council, we are exploring additional alerts to add to our communication cadence to keep partners informed of all types of security updates.

On occasion, there are industry-wide trends or topics that are tangentially related to security – even if not solely focused on an issue with our product – that we want to share with partners. We post this kind of content on our [Advisories](/company/trust/advisories) page in our Trust Center, which also features an RSS feed to subscribe to updates. For example, last week, we posted an Advisory about an increase in phishing attempts we’ve seen reported by our partners. Historically, this time of year tends to see an increase in these types of attacks across the industry, and we want to ensure our partners remain vigilant in monitoring for malicious content as threats continue to become more sophisticated. It’s important to note that while the instance we referenced in our Advisory was tied to ConnectWise Control, it was completely unrelated to the patch to the product. Phishing attempts happen far too often, and we continue to do our part to report and shut down the nefarious domains associated with attempts to convince our partners to share their credentials. If you see an attempt like this, please visit our [Trust Center](/company/trust) as a central place to manage security-related content.

## **Recommendations**

Conversations online can often swirl up dialogue – which we take in stride provided it points to a safer environment for our partners. We want to take this opportunity again to remind our partners and their clients to safeguard themselves by following security best practices such as:

* Patch your systems as soon as possible by following a defined patch management process that offers timely risk remediation.
* Evaluate any compensating controls to reduce/mitigate the risk to vulnerabilities.
* Communicate with end users the paramount importance of avoiding social engineering attacks, including but not limited to phishing attacks.  Be diligent. Never trust, always verify.

## **Transforming our Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)**

Earlier this year, we had the pleasure of meeting with a handful of partners where we introduced the Product Security Response Team (PSRT) here at ConnectWise. The PSRT team will be leading the charge to identify ways to improve how we gather and communicate information about product vulnerabilities to our partners.

While building on the momentum of other successful reports of effectively managed disclosures, we were in the final phases of preparing communications and updated pages when the opportunity presented itself here to provide notification of some of the changes happening within our program. We encourage you to visit our updated [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](/company/trust/security/vulnerability-disclosure-policy) to view our set of guidelines for researchers to engage with us.

This VDP update is just the first step in the transformation of our Product Security program. Our intention is to drive transparency and continuous improvement, both large initiatives of change and incremental changes. We are confident that after we gather and understand the data and further align our internal processes, that we can promote a better experience of processing disclosures.

## **Moving forward together**

Protecting the security of the industry is a team effort. In addition to our own efforts to review, assess, and build products and services with a security-first mindset, we encourage members of the community to responsibly disclose any issues they may come across. We’ve had the privilege of working with great partners, vendors, and researchers to ensure the highest level of security standards are followed; we look forward to continuing that tradition in the years to come.

# Proof Of Concept: Connectwise Control Screenconnect Signed Executable to Arbitrary Code Execution via ARP Poisoning / DNS Hijacking / Unsanitized Client Parameters or Host Headers with CVE-2020-3147 (Cisco Sx / SMB Series Switches)

December 6, 2022[CVE](https://cybir.com/category/cve/)[Cyber Security](https://cybir.com/category/cyber-security/)[Forensics](https://cybir.com/category/forensics/)[Incident Response](https://cybir.com/category/incident-response/)

I am providing this simple proof of concept walkthrough to demonstrate weaponization of an Arbitrary Code Execution (HTTP/HTTPS Request) in Connectwise ScreenConnect & Control Client (via CVE-2020-3147.) This walkthrough can be performed / used to man-in-the-middle or poison DNS requests via Responder and trigger the condition.

Step 1: Attacker triggers CVE-2020-3147 via malformed HTTP request to web interface. OR… step 2.

[Cisco Small Business Switches Denial of Service Vulnerability – Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/csa/cisco-sa-smlbus-switch-dos-R6VquS2u.html)

Step 2: The attacker poisons DNS via ARP / Known Attacks. Responder provides a spoofed DNS record.

Responder Launch

![](https://cybir.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-12.png)

Poisoned DNS response.

On the victim machine, the DNS record is poisoned:

![](https://cybir.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/two-fqdns-1024x546.png)

Pre-Activation copy of ScreenConnect controlled by attacker.

***The client is downloaded by the victim*** and executes the requested code. (http request to vulnerable Cisco switch, exploit embedded in file & HTTP request to 192.168.1.254)

***THIS EXECUTABLE, SIGNED BINARY BYPASSES HASH BANNING AND ENDPOINT CONTROLS…. in things like Huntress!***

![](https://cybir.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-14.png)
## Attack Flow: What has happened?

1. The trusted executable still runs, triggering an HTTP request to the resolving IP.
2. This MALFORMED HTTP Request is the exploit for CVE-2020-3147
3. The client is tampered (via Poisoning of the DNS response or hijacked record.)
4. The now resolving DNS record is where the request is sent.
5. The server fails to sanitize these parameters.
6. Open WinHex and examine the executable.
7. Look at this client download request.. IT’S VIA HTTP!

[Intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy – PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/intercepting-http-traffic)

![](https://cybir.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-13-1024x363.png)

It really is this easy. No social engineering needed.

I have succesfully tampered with a trusted, signed executable in transit. The executable performs an arbitrary HTTP request that will reboot a Cisco Sx series switch and allow the attacker to MITM / ARP / HTTP intercept the entire network.\*The switch / network are taken down for 5-10 minutes.. hence a Denial of Service (and high severity problem, ask Cisco!)

Over the past few weeks, the Huntress team has been tracking the recent conversations surrounding supposed ConnectWise Control vulnerabilities and alleged in-the-wild exploitation.

We have been in contact with both the ConnectWise CISO and security team, as well as the security researcher reporting on this. While there has since been [some chatter](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/yrkhs2/connectwise_control_possible_vulnerability/) and [news articles](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/connectwise-quietly-patches-flaw-that-helps-phishers/), we would like to use this article to share our own perspective.

**TL;DR:** We politely disagree with the threat and criticality presented by the security researcher.

**The reason for this writeup is threefold:**

* Offer peace of mind regarding the claimed vulnerabilities in ConnectWise Control
* Demonstrate proper responsible disclosure efforts and partnership between vendors
* Showcase other tradecraft that emphasizes the need for human security awareness, not just for end users but also system administrators and MSP businesses

Additionally, weâll share our own insights and what we are seeing for strictly social engineering and phishing attacks against ConnectWise Control.

Weâve got a [proven track record](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial_ransomware_incident_in_progress/) of calling for [responsible disclosure](/blog/vulnerabilities-and-information-disclosure-in-msp-survey-software) when there is [something](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/rdba36/critical_rce_vulnerability_is_affecting_java/) that [could impact the MSP community](/blog/critical-vulnerability-disclosure-connectwise/r1soft-server-backup-manager-remote-code-execution-supply-chain-risks?hs_preview=FgbwQkbk-89967421013) at large. With that in mind, we charge not only ourselves, but the community as a whole to hold both security researchers and vendors accountable as we work to improve the security landscape *together.*

## Our Validation

At IT Nation Connect on November 9th, the Huntress team was at our booth chatting with partners on the tradeshow floor, when a community member came up to speak with us expressing they had just been compromised âthrough ConnectWise Control.â

Hearing this, one of our team members remembered a recent post on LinkedIn suggesting that there was going to be information publicly disclosed on a new ConnectWise Control vulnerability that is being actively exploited in the wild. Our CEO and a small group of Huntress researchers rushed out of the booth, dashed to the nearest quiet corner, got out our laptops and started to investigate. We reached out to the researcher who posted this, set up a phone call, and created an internal Slack channel to communicate with the rest of our team.

![image3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296e66_image3.png)

We got to work reviewing our past incident reports and tracked activity against ConnectWise Control.Â

Throughout the last few months, our ThreatOps analysts *have* been seeing and notifying partners of attacks involving ConnectWise Control. However, these were **not** implications of DDoS, hijacking, poisoning, injection, botnets, amplification attacks, sideband attacks, remote code execution or any of the other critical-severity threats posed in the researcherâs article.

![image5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296e67_image5.png)

The most prevalent threat against ConnectWise Control that Huntress as well as the community has seen and shared is **social engineering and phishing attempts.** These are very common with scams and ploys to lure a victim into calling a phone number, where the adversary will answer and masquerade as a help-desk as a support line for companies like BestBuy or GeekSquad, and encourage the end user to download and run a legitimate Control client.Â

Huntress reported 14 cases of attacks involving ConnectWise Control, while this increased to 85 in November. Since the beginning of December, we have reported over 60 cases of these ârogueâ Control installs.

On this front, Huntress is aware of multiple domains and IP addresses included in phishing attempts involving ConnectWise Control. This list is included at the very end of this writeup and available with [this direct gist link](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/4e7f0690e619139323d25ac3eb586b7f).

From our understanding as well as ConnectWiseâs assessment, there *was* a peculiar trick included in the security researcherâs initial report. Prior to the Control 22.8 release, the URL parameters **h** (host) and **p** (port) included in downloading a Control client were able to be manipulated to point the connection to another endpoint.Â

***Video demonstration:*** *requesting a URL with modified parameters to point to another ConnectWise Control Server*

This means that the URL included within a phishing email *may* point to a trusted address, like a ConnectWise Control server that the end user recognizes for their own company or organization -- but the downloaded client would direct them to a different Control server altogether.

* Say your organization genuinely uses **msp123.screenconnect.com** for Control
* An end-user might receive an email with a link to the *genuine* **msp123.screenconnect.com**

* The URL parameters are modified to point towards **attacker789.screenconnect.com**

* The threat actor *still needs to control* **attacker789.screenconnect.com** to accept the request.
* (The threat actor may as well have just performed typo-squatting and used their own
  **msp-123.screenconnect.com**, added hyphen, in the original phishing lure)

This weakness might aid in some social engineering and phishing ploys, but it would not be classified as an **exploit**. The adversary would still need *their own* ConnectWise Control server under their control to properly receive and respond to the connection requestâ¦ which provides no advantage from what they would have already started with. Both parties still need to willingly accept and acknowledge the request.

***Video demonstration:*** *invoking the ConnectWise Control client pointed to another Control server and starting remote control*

ConnectWise Control versions 22.8 and above address the issue of arbitrary **h** and **p** parameters and all cloud instances are updated to remediate this, including all available free trials of the software.

When a fellow community member, security researcher or anyone brings security concerns like this to us, we do our own internal analysis but we also coordinate with fellow vendors to validate our findings. Live in the back corner at IT Nation Connect, we spoke face-to-face with the ConnectWise CISO and members of the security team to see the big picture and determine what risk is posed to the security landscape as a whole. It is vital that vendors collaborate on security issues, and make our industry *better together.*

## Our Assessment

It is important to note that even generating a new client pointed to a different Control server is still ***just*** *initiating a connection to another Control server.* This is not arbitrary code execution from a signed binary, and does not allow an adversary to run commands or control the target *without* the user still being deceived under a social engineering ploy.

On the phone with the researcher on November 9th, Huntress came to the conclusion that ultimately this is not a novel technique and poses no new threat to organizations. With that said, we feel that ConnectWiseâs decision to express this as a simple advisory and notification was the correct course of action.

***Video demonstration:*** *invoking the ConnectWise Control agent, pointed towards an attacker's netcat listener,
showcasing the TCP connection and packets but no arbitrary code execution.*

In the following weeks after IT Nation Connect, the researcher expressed on LinkedIn there would be more details to come and their public blog post would soon be released.

On November 29, their public writeup was available and subsequently got the attention of some reporters and journalists. Huntress researchers spoke further with the individual, asking if they could share a video demonstration to more clearly showcase the claimed severity and impact, but they were unwilling to produce one.Â

The latter blog posts shared by the security researcher attempt to express this as a risk concerning domain names and certificate trusts. Further, the writeups suggest this alleged attack may be chained together with other potential old CVEs & vulnerabilities and devices that *might* be present within an internal network.Â

Our hesitation with this approach is that it is not an exploit targeting strictly ConnectWise Control, the core issue is still dependent on social engineering, and the claimed continued threat relies on hypotheticals of whether or not vulnerable devices *might* be present even *inside* a target environment.Â

The core threat posed against ConnectWise Control still remains to be social engineering and phishing -- nothing that could not be done with any other publicly available remote desktop control software like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, or others.

There are repeated claims by the security researcher that this does not require social engineering, but we (alongside other members of the community) contend that it does.

On 01 December, after Brian Krebs reported on this with [his own news story](https://web.archive.org/web/20221207235452/http%3A//web.archive.org/screenshot/https%3A//krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/connectwise-quietly-patches-flaw-that-helps-phishers/), both us at Huntress and ConnectWise had a growing concern that this would stir more fear, uncertainty and doubt within the community. Still with an open mind, willing to better understand this and make sense of the posed claims, we spoke again with the researcher.

One byproduct of generating a new Control client was creating a new executable with a legitimate ConnectWise signed certificate. This led to some claims by the security researcher that it was an undetectable attack, bypassing antivirus and endpoint security controls and gaining remote code execution. However, again, this binary is still a pure ConnectWise Control agent that just reaches out to connect to a ConnectWise Control server.Â

We asked for more clarification and once again asked if they could provide a technical video demonstration to showcase the process and achieve this desired effect, but the researcher still refused.

With that said, during our communication the security researcher did note another oddity in ConnectWise Controlâs behavior. Our team at Huntress pulled this thread a bit further and went down a different path, derivative of the security researcherâs claims but not strictly what they posed in their multiple articles.

## Our Further Exploration

Alongside the different pre-update and post-update versions of ConnectWise Control, we also have to consider the different variations of deployment: either an *on-premises* installation of the server or a *cloud* instance (accessible in free-trials).

The security researcher did include screenshots of an interesting trick while requesting a new client binary from a Control server: supplying *your own* modified **Host**Â HTTP header. Evident in their provided screenshots, their downloaded executable would attempt to connect to the desired endpoint, but fail to download or retrieve new data.

***Video demonstration:*** *modifying the HTTP Host header to download a signed ConnectWise Control installer,
pointing to an arbitrary endpoint to install the software.*

This executable looked to be reaching out to fully *install* the software required for the ConnectWise Control connection, pulled once again from the server.Â

What we did not see tested in the security researcher's report was staging an endpoint to provide data that the new client binary *was expecting* to receive. Since we could control this **Host**Â header in the request, it is possible to generate a binary that will download and install a provided application from any location.Â

***Video demonstration:*** *inspecting the signed ConnectWise Control installer downloaded via the modified Host header,
observing how it reaches out to the supplied location to install and execute any arbitrary code.*

If we could stage an endpoint to serve the same application files that the download would expect, it would install and execute our own provided code. That actually ***could*** turn into arbitrary code execution under a signed ConnectWise binary!

To validate this, we reviewed the error logs when the client-download procedure failed, and we could see it attempted to reach out to the provided **Host**header location and download a **.application** file.

***Video demonstration:*** *signed ConnectWise Control installer, modified by HTTP Host Header tampering to download an install separate software other than ConnectWise Control: in this case, a stub for the Windows Calculator application.*

This **.application** file is a [ClickOnce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce) application, which is a native component and feature of Windows operating systems (with.NET frameworks version 2.0 or later) that will automatically *install* and then *execute* a program hosted from an online website with a single click.

To note, the ClickOnce application could be any C# code we might like. Spawning the calculator application is a fine sample test, but this could just as easily be any malicious payload: starting a reverse shell connection, invoking any other malware, or whatever nefarious activity one might like (still under the thumb of antivirus and other endpoint security controls).

***Video demonstration:*** *signed ConnectWise Control installer staged to start a reverse shell connection to the attacker.*

The executable downloaded from the Control server is, still, a signed ConnectWise executable. But with this technique, we have the program download and install *something else* that is ***not*** ConnectWise Control!

It is worthwhile to mention that while the starting program will be a legitimate signed executable, the built ClickOnce application will prompt confirmation dialogues that show the installed application may *not* be signed. Running the downloaded client binary is one process, but the newly installed ClickOnce application will be spawned as its own new process.Â

Considering this executable does prompt for approval of this new installation, again this technique requires user interaction and ultimately *social engineering.* This might accomplish the task of running truly arbitrary code underneath a signed ConnectWise binary, but the core tradecraft *still* relies on human deception.

Additionally, this effort of modifying the **Host**Â HTTP header *removes* the only redeeming trick of the **h** and **p** URL parameter scheme. Because this relies on a HTTP header, the delivery can no longer be a simple text link embedded with an email. Granted, an attacker could (1) perform some cross-site scripting techniques to force the end userâs browser to request the URL, (2) stage other HTML and JavaScript code to coerce a drive-by-download of the binary itself, or (3) host or attach the downloaded binary to the email.

Needless to say, all of those stipulations add more complexities and dependencies to this tradecraft, and it may just not be worth it for an adversary in the first place. The necessity of social engineering throughout any of these attack scenarios greatly reduces the risk and criticality -- it all still relies on fooling the victim, and the best defense is security awareness and training.

Ultimately, after pushing this further based off of the security researcherâs claims and executing more than *just* regular ScreenConnect functionality under the signed binary, we continued to communicate and collaborate with ConnectWise.

## Our Collaboration

When we shared this custom ClickOnce technique with ConnectWise, they were appreciative of us bringing it to their attention. Our conversations together clarified our own understanding of the attack surface, and re-emphasized the importance of security awareness and training for not only end-users, but system administrators just as well.

* ConnectWise released Control versions [22.8.10013](https://control.product.connectwise.com/communities/26/topics/4135-connectwise-control-228#comment-13529) and [22.9.10032](https://control.product.connectwise.com/communities/26/topics/4153-connectwise-control-229#comment-13530) to mitigate the URL manipulation reported by the security researcher.
* On all cloud instances and post-update on-premises installations, the social engineering schemes and scams are still very possible, but **server redirection by parameters is no longer possible.**
* Separate from the security researcherâs information, post-update the **Host** HTTP header tampering and custom ClickOnce scenario we described above:
* is *only possible* against **on-premises** installations of ConnectWise Control.
* is ***not*** *possible* on **cloud instances**, as the **Host** HTTP header is used for proxying

Team members at ConnectWise explained that, just by the nature of the beast with remote support software (especially offered via both cloud and on-premises environments), there is always a potential risk of social engineering scams. Trust and certification of executable binaries is an interesting discussion point.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6579dd0b5f9a54376d296939/65806b6833f6939672be1f02_image7.webp)

The ConnectWise Control client binary that is downloaded is **not** signed by the on-premises server, as that server application certainly should not ship with the official signing permissions. From what we understand, some configuration information can be included *after* signing the executable *without* corrupting the signature. This attached configuration information instructs the client to download the actual ClickOnce application from any external location. Even if the on-premises instance is protected, it is technically possible to take any Control client executable and modify the configuration to have it reach out and download a potentially malicious application without invalidating the code signing.Â

This is a ânecessary evilâ in offering the remote desktop application in the freely accessible and available methods that they do. Signing executables but maintaining the ability to be hosted from individual organizations poses a peculiar and difficult problem to solve.

With that said, the **Host** header tampering technique is *ineffective* for cloud instances because the frontend service is *not* the true ConnectWise Control relay server. The **Host** HTTP header is used within the internal proxy to properly route to the correct cloud instance dedicated to the userâs deployment.

That means that manipulating the **Host** header in the cloud will **not** reach a proper endpoint to even download the client binary from.Â

***Video demonstration:*** *requesting a ConnectWise Control installer with modified Host headers fails against cloud instances.*

For on-premises installations, it is crucial that the system administrators follow the proper installation procedures and manual, other hardening guides and the provided [ConnectWise Control security checklist.](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Control_Documentation/Get_started/Security_checklist)Â

Present in the documentation, users with on-premises installations are recommended to configure their **WebServerAddressableUrl** and **RelayAddressableUrl** to prevent the proxying technique we demonstrated above (or define a specific alternate host to be used).

ConnectWise expressed to us that they are working with their education team to get this recommendation added to the [best practice guide](https://university.connectwise.com/content/UserDocs/Business_Knowledge/ConnectWise_Control_Comprehensive_Security_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf) for Control partners.Â

## Parting Thoughts

To be clear, this response is not intended to point fingers or confront any parties involved. We hope to offer our own perspective, but remain receptive to new information or clarification that helps educate *us* just as well.Â

Between buzzword bingo, logical leaps of faith, uncertain hypotheticals and a core component that still presents nothing new or novel, we politely disagree with the proposed severity from the security researcherâs report.

Other community members have engaged in the conversation to better understand and clarify these issues, but there is a recurring message and theme: **we all need to be responsible when sounding the alarm**.Â

Without shown work or tangible proof, bold claims and technobabble only puts people into panic. Thousands of MSPs use tools like ConnectWise Control and when someone cries wolf, it undermines our entire industry.Â

We *need* to address the FUD and fluff that is all too common. We need to collaborate with others and *solve* problems, not make them worse. Letâs continue to work together to ***improve* the security landscape**.
