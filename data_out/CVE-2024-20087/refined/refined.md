Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20087:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `vdec` (video decoder) component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** The absence of proper bounds checking allows a write operation to occur outside the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation, meaning an attacker with system-level privileges could potentially gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation: The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious actor who already has obtained system level privileges on the device.
- No User Interaction: The vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have already achieved 'System' level privilege on the affected device. This implies a prior exploit or compromise of the system.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- MT6765, MT6768, MT6779, MT6785, MT8385, MT8666, MT8667, MT8766, MT8768, MT8781, MT8788, MT8789

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 12.0

**Report Source:**
- Internal

**Summary of CVE-2024-20087**
This vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the video decoder component which can be exploited by a local attacker with system privileges to escalate to higher privileges.
