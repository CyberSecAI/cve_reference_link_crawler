The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Scriptcase, including CVE-2024-46082.

**CVE-2024-46082**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to unsanitized input in the `nm_cor.php` file, located in the `/prod/cor` folder. This file takes user input without encoding, and renders it directly in the view, allowing for execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the application, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is initiated by sending a crafted request to `https://www.website.com/_lib/prod/cor/nm_cor.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `form` parameter, e.g., `form=t"></ScrIpT><SvG/Onload=alert(document.cookie);>`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

The content also mentions other vulnerabilities, which are tracked under different CVE IDs:

*   **CVE-2024-46084:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the import feature due to a `shell_exec` call within the `nm_unzip` function.
    *   The `nm_unzip` function receives a filename and a directory. The filename is passed unsanitized to a `shell_exec` command, which allows for command injection.
    *  An attacker can upload a crafted zip file with a malicious filename containing shell commands.
    *   The attacker requires permissions to import projects.
*   **CVE-2024-46080:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the export feature due to a `shell_exec` call within the `nm_zip` function.
    * Similar to the import feature vulnerability, the filename and directory are passed unsanitized to a `shell_exec` command, which allows for command injection.
    *   The attacker requires permissions to export projects.
*   **CVE-2024-46083, CVE-2024-46081, CVE-2024-46079**: Stored XSS vulnerabilities in:
    *   `msg.php` (id\_form\_msg\_title param)
    *   `todo.php` (todo\_title param)
    *   `proj_new.php` (Descricao param)
    * These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed when other users access the affected pages.
