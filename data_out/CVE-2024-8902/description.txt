The Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.8 via the render_column function in modules/data-table/widgets/data-table.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft template data.
