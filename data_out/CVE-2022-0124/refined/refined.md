{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Slack integration in GitLab was not properly escaping Slack macros present in Merge Request titles before sending notifications to Slack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a specific context (Slack macros)",
       "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Users clicking on the modified links in Slack notifications are redirected to a malicious website instead of the intended GitLab URL. This can lead to further exploitation of the client (browser attacks, local network attacks), or trick users into providing their login credentials on a fake site.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious Merge Request title containing Slack macros.",
      "Forking a GitLab project, creating a malicious merge request and submitting it to the original repository"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a Merge Request. They can achieve this by forking a project and contributing a Merge Request or by being a member of the project with appropriate permissions.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of escaping special characters for Slack when generating notifications. Specifically, it does not escape Slack formatting macros. This allows an attacker to manipulate the URL that is displayed in the Slack notification, redirecting users to any URL they choose. The suggested fix is to properly escape special characters as described in Slack's API documentation."
