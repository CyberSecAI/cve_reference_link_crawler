Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of user-provided data within `MessageTemplate` without proper sanitization, leading to potential format string injection. Specifically, the `MessageTemplate` allowed access to private attributes, which could be exploited to leak sensitive information like environment variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Format String Injection:** User-controlled input in the message template could be crafted to access and leak internal attributes, including potentially sensitive data.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `MessageTemplate` class did not filter or validate user-provided data before processing it as part of the template.
*   **Access to Private Attributes:** The template mechanism allowed access to private attributes of the objects it was formatting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leak:** Attackers could potentially leak sensitive information, such as environment variables, through the exploitation of format string injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the injection of malicious format strings within user-provided data that is then used in `MessageTemplate`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privilege:** An attacker only requires low privileges and needs to have a way to influence the input processed by `MessageTemplate`.
*   **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required for the exploit as user provided data is part of the attack vector.
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Format String).
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `nonebot2` between `2.0.0a16` and `2.1.3`.
*   The issue was fixed in version `2.2.0`.
*   A temporary workaround was to filter underscores before incorporating user input into the message template.
*   The fix involves preventing access to private attributes in the `MessageTemplate`.
