# Potential Information Leak in User-Constructed Message Templates

Moderate

[yanyongyu](/yanyongyu)
published
GHSA-59j8-776v-xxxg
Feb 9, 2024

## Package

pip

nonebot2
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=2.0.0a16,<=2.1.3

## Patched versions

2.2.0

## Description

### Impact

This security advisory pertains to a potential information leak (e.g., environment variables) in instances where developers utilize `MessageTemplate` and incorporate user-provided data into templates.

### Patches

The identified vulnerability has been remedied in fix [#2509](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2/pull/2509) and will be included in versions released after 2.1.3. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to these patched versions to safeguard against the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround involves filtering underscores before incorporating user input into the message template.

### References

* [Pull Request #2509](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2/pull/2509)
* [CWE-1336](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1336.html)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-21624
