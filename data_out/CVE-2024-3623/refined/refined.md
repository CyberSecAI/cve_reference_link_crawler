Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3623:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default database secret key (`DATABASE_SECRET_KEY`) being stored in plain text within the `config.yaml` file, which is part of the mirror-registry configuration for deploying Quay.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext storage of sensitive data:** The database secret key, which should be treated as highly confidential, is stored in plaintext, making it easily accessible if the configuration file is exposed.
- **Predictable secret key:** Since it's a default value, multiple installations of Quay using mirror-registry might end up using the same key.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** An attacker who gains access to the configuration file can obtain the database secret key.
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** With the database secret key, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in the Quay database.
- **Compromise of multiple Quay instances:** Because of the default key usage, multiple Quay installations could be compromised using the same key.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Exposure of the configuration file:** An attacker could gain access to the `config.yaml` file through various means, including but not limited to:
    - Unprotected file system access
    - Vulnerable deployment process
    - Supply chain attack
- **Network Access:** An attacker with access to the network could intercept traffic during the configuration process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the configuration file**: The attacker needs access to the mirror-registry configuration file (`config.yaml`) where the database secret key is stored in plain text.
- **Knowledge of Quay database access:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to access the Quay database using the compromised database secret key.

**Additional notes:**
The information provided explicitly states the vulnerability affects `mirror-registry` installations of Quay. This suggests the vulnerability is related to the deployment mechanism, rather than Quay itself. This vulnerability makes all instances of Quay deployed with mirror-registry vulnerable if the default key is not changed.
