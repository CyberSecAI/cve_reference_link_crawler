Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-33502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the `normalize-url` Node.js package. Specifically, versions prior to 4.5.1, 5.x prior to 5.3.1, and 6.x prior to 6.0.1 are affected.
*   The root cause is a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) vulnerability related to how the package handles data URLs. This is caused by an inefficient regular expression used when parsing data URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **ReDoS:** The primary vulnerability is a Regular expression Denial of Service. This means that a specially crafted input (a data URL in this case) can cause the regular expression engine to take an excessively long time to process, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service. This implies that the application using the vulnerable version of `normalize-url` becomes unresponsive or unavailable, as it's tied up in processing the malicious input.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through crafted data URLs supplied as input to the vulnerable `normalize-url` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N), nor is user interaction required (UI:N). The vulnerability can be triggered remotely (AV:N)
*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious data URL to an application using the vulnerable version of the `normalize-url` library.

**Additional Information from NetApp Advisory:**
*   NetApp products that are affected include NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH), with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
*   NetApp has released a fix in version 3.0 of the E-Series Performance Analyzer.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a ReDoS vulnerability in the `normalize-url` Node.js package. By providing a crafted data URL, an attacker can cause the application using this library to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
