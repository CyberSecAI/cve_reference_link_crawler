# Potential memory leak: forgetting to free the return value of libxml2 API ‘xmlGetProp’

This issue lies in the `plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c:858`.

Libxml2 API document of API 'xmlGetProp' emphasizes: *Returns: the attribute value or NULL if not found. It's up to the caller to free the memory with xmlFree().*. So it can cause memory leak without calling g\_free(line\_text).
