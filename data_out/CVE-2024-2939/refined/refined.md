Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateExaminee.php` file within the "Online Examination System" application. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application directly uses unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter, enabling the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Displaying inappropriate content
    *   Downloading malware onto the user's system
    *   Hijacking user sessions and stealing sensitive information
    *   Modifying website content
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a URL that includes a malicious script in the `id` parameter of the `updateExaminee.php` file. For example: `id=9%22%><Script>alert(%22updateExaminee%22)</Script>%22<`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL. They can then trick users into clicking the malicious link, or embed it into other websites to execute the code in the context of the vulnerable application.
*   No specific authentication or privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability as it is reflected.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable software is "campcodes Online Examination System" version 1.0 or earlier.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateExaminee.php` file
*   The payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability was `id=9%22%><Script>alert(%22updateExaminee%22)</Script>%22<`
