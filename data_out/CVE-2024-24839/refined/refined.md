- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Structured Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website. This is a classic example of an injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts (like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, redirecting users to malicious sites, displaying unwanted content, or even taking over user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the plugin's input fields which do not sanitize input. The specific attack vector and affected field(s) are not described in this content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the 'Contributor' privilege within the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests the vulnerability may be related to how a contributor can add/edit content within the structured content plugin.
