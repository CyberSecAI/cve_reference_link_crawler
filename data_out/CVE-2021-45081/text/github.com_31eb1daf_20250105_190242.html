Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/19>

Diff to last release: [v3.3.2...v3.3.3](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.3.2...v3.3.3)

**Announcements**:

* None

**New**:

* Uyuni Proxies can now be set with the schema validation. [#3061](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3061)
* Cobbler should now build on AlmaLinux. [#3064](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3064)
* The initrd is not required anymore as it is an optional file. [#3127](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3127)
* XML-RPC: Added `dump_vars` endpoint. This is intended to replace `get_blended_data` as of 3.4.0. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* XML-RPC: Added `get_item_resolved_value` ([#3056](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3056)) & `set_item_resolved_value` ([#3134](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3134)) endpoints.

**Breaking Changes**:

* The field `virt_file_size` is now a float and the related settings as well. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)

**Changes**:

* The error messages for duplicated objects now contains the name of the duplicated object. [#3129](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3129)

**Bugfixes**:

* Dictionaries had the wrong value set for `<<inherit>>` [#3128](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3128)
* There were some cases in which the autoinstallation manager was handed the wrong object and then crashed. [#3130](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3130)
* The inheritance of the `owners` field was fixed. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* Serial Console options should not contain bogous `-1` value anymore. [#3105](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3105)
* HTTP API should not throw permission errors anymore. [#3046](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3046) [#3080](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3080)
* During build the log was not visible due to a custom logger without output. [#3059](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3059)
* `cobbler mkloaders` now also copies dependencies of `menu.c32`. [#3058](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3058)
* We now generate the grub configuration for the architectures correct again. [#3097](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3097)
* `virt_file_size` now is a float at all times. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)
* Cobbler should restart successfully now if you have attached an image to a system. [#3044](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3044)
* If you have a system named `default` the bootloader was not removed properly before. [#3045](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3045)
* `cobbler buildiso`: The `isolinux.cfg` was not properly formatted. [#3047](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3047)
* There were unharmful templating errors in the log related to `redhat_management_type`. The parts depending on this were removed. [#3048](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3048)
* The DNS managers were non-functional before because of a not existing function call. [#3049](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3049)
* `cobbler buildiso` failed with `--tmpdir`s that don't end in `buildiso`. [#3050](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3050)
* `cobbler buildiso` had outdated docs and help messages for some parameters. [#3051](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3051)
* `cobbler import`: It was impossible to import Rocky Linux 8.5 successfully. [#3052](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3052)
* Cobbler created duplicated settings files before. [#3053](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3053)
* `cobbler sync` was broken by refactoring to `shell=False` before. [#3054](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3054)

This release got everything! Security, Features, Bugfixes, ...

We have 422 files changed, 25375 insertions(+), 34826 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/10>

Diff to last release: [v3.2.1...v3.3.0](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0)

**Known Issues**:

* `cobbler <item> rename` is not working currently
* `cobbler <item> edit` may have bugs due to the internal refactorings

**Breaking Changes**:

* The webinterface got removed [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2434) [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2286) [#2700](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2700)
  + Please use the CLI in the meantime
  + A new webinterface is under development at <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler-web>
  + The core code has priority at any time. There are third party tools available which provide a webinterface and use

    Cobbler as a backend. A list of those tools can be found at the bottom of the following page: <https://cobbler.github.io/users.html>
* The Cobbler internal TFTP Demon got removed [#2512](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2512)
* `yaboot` support got removed as a bootloader for PowerPC [#2723](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2723)

**Announcements**:

* Important Security Bugfixes [#2794](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2794) [#2795](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795)
  + Arbitrary Read was possible through `generate_script()`
  + Arbitrary Write was possible through `upload_log_data()`
  + Log poisoning with Remote-Code-Execution was possible through any XMLRPC method which logs to the logfile.
* There was an internal refactoring from runtime created Python attributes to Python Properties. This allows much

  better data validation and thus better error handling but also introduced new bugs.
