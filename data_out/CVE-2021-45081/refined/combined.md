Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities affecting cobbler

Hello list,

Last October 2021, I started a review on a subset of the Cobbler
ecosystem  ([1], [2] and [3]) using the master branch at the time the
request was made [4].

During the audit several issues were found and three of them, have been
assigned with a CVE identifier.

1) CVE-2021-45083 - unsafe permissions on sensitive files in /etc/cobbler

It has been found that files in /etc/cobbler are world readable and two
of those files contain sensitive information that can be used by an
attacker to open an authenticated session with cobbler daemon:

     * users.digest file contains sha2-512 digests of users in cobbler
	local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password,
	it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string.
     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 145 Oct 11 09:15 users.digest

     * settings.yaml file contains secrets like hashed default password
	and more.
     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5051 Dec 13 12:42 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml

Assigned CVSS 8.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

This vulnerability affects also koan [5] and products built using
cobbler like SUSE Manager 4.1 and 4.2.
SUSE Manager 4.3 is not affected by this issue.

The issue affects cobbler version 3.3.1 and previous. Version 3.X.X is safe.

Upstream was fixed by this commit:
<https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/34e3417bcbb72d28c3c1c3332af85793ba077f75>

Please note that a possible workaround is trivial. As root you have to
setup the configuration files, to make them readable only by root.

---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<
# chmod go-r /etc/cobbler/users.digest
# chmod go-r /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<---%<

2) CVE-2021-45082 - incomplete template sanitization

In templar.py file, function check_for_invalid_imports, ensures that
Cheetah code is not importing Python modules. However, the control is
very basic and it fires up when line begins with #import:

     lines = data.split("\n")
     for line in lines:
         if line.find("#import") != -1:
             rest = line.replace("#import", "").replace(" ", "").strip()
             if self.settings and rest not in
			self.settings.cheetah_import_whitelist:
                 raise CX("potentially insecure import in template: %s" %
			rest)

However, according to Cheetah documentation [6], it is possible to
include python code using this syntax:

#from MODULE import MODULE_OR_OBJECT [as NAME] [, ...]

Having a rogue module using #from can bypass import sanitization
declared so far.

Assigned CVSS 7.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

This vulnerability affects also products built using cobbler like SUSE
Manager 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Koan is not affected by this issue.

Upstream was fixed by this commit:
<https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/c9a094541d81ce6d753f03888d763ff28b9ada72>

3) CVE-2021-45081: unsafe protocol usage

A lot of cobbler server entry-points are served on HTTP rather then HTTPS.

Assigned CVSS 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

This vulnerability affects also products built using cobbler like koan
and SUSE Manager 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

At the time of disclosing this, there is no a fix available. Using HTTPS
everywhere requires a deep knowledge of how customers implements cobbler
in their network and how do they manage certificates.

Accordingly with the maintainer we will keep attention on this in order
to create a certificate enrolling and trusting layer in the python code
for the future.

CVSS 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

With the author, we agreed that fixing this will take longer, since it
involves
several architectural decision on certifciate enrollment and trust.

4) Hardcoded password for testing

When in /etc/cobbler/modules.conf, in the [authentication] part the
module is “testing”, the credential “testing:testing” is used to
authenticate users.

This is a known and well documented issues.
However the upstream maintainer agreed, that this functionality is no
longer needed and it can safely removed.

5) Log file pollution

In modules/installation/pre_log.py and modules/installation/post_log.py,
some user controlled input strings are appended in
/var/log/cobbler/install.log log file without sanitization.

This can lead to a log pollution attack, where users inject rogue log
statements making hard troubleshooting by sysadmins.

6) Timeline

2021-12-10: vulnerabilities were reported to upstream author
2021-12-16: upstream author acknowledge them and start working on fixes
2021-12-16: received CVEs from Mitre. Offered author an embargo until
             2022-02-16
2022-02-16: we agreed with the author two more embargo day to prepare
	    all fixed packages
2022-02-18: fixes reached upstream repository and findings were public

* Kickstarting into puppet

## Kickstarting into puppet

05 December 2006

The [topic](https://www.redhat.com/archives/et-mgmt-tools/2006-December/msg00000.html) of kickstarting and enabling puppet came up on [et-mgmt-tools](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/et-mgmt-tools). In addition to what I’ve said [previously](http://watzmann.net/blog/index.php?title=provisioning_puppet&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) on the subject, a few more tips:

#### 1. Installing `puppet` in the main `%packages` section

If you are using Fedora Core 6, you can specify additional yum repos right
in the kickstart file; with that you can install puppet from the main
`%packages` section. Simply add

```
repo --name=extras --mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=extras-$releasever&amp;arch=$basearch
...
%packages
puppet

```

to your kickstart file (don’t forget to put real values in for `$basearch`
and `$releasever`)

#### 2. Do the initial `puppet` run from the kickstart

Anaconda does not set the hostname during installation, even if the DHCP
server sends one. The hostname is needed though if we want to do the
initial puppet run from within the kickstart. One way to find the hostname
is to look at the file `/tmp/netinfo` that anaconda produces; with that you
can do the initial puppet run like so:

```
%post --nochroot
# Copy netinfo, which has our FQDN from DHCP, into the chroot
test -f /tmp/netinfo &amp;&amp; cp /tmp/netinfo /mnt/sysimage/tmp/

%post
/sbin/chkconfig --level 345 puppet on
# Figure out the FQDN
if [ -f /tmp/netinfo ] ; then
  FQDN=`(source /tmp/netinfo; [ -n "$DOMAIN" ] &amp;&amp; echo $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN || echo $HOSTNAME)`
  # Run puppet, just to get the certs; the actual config update happens
  # on the next reboot
  hostname $FQDN
  /usr/sbin/puppetd -o -v --tag no_such_tag --waitforcert 600
fi

```

The invocation of `puppetd` is done solely to get the certs, and assumes
that your `puppetmaster` is called `puppet`. Passing `--tag no_such_tag`
makes sure that puppet goes through all its motions without actually
changing anything, assuming you have nothing in your manifest tagged with
`no_such_tag`.

Of course, you need to make sure that the `puppetmaster` is ready to accept
a certificate signing request when you kickstart the client — make
sure you run `puppetca --clean CLIENT` on teh `puppetmaster` before
kickstarting, and that the signing request actually gets signed when the
client runs puppet; turning on autosigning for that client for a brief
period of time should do that.

[Cobbler V3.3.3](/cobbler/cobbler/releases/tag/v3.3.3)

This release is containing a lot of backports from `main` to make Cobbler ready to be shipped in Uyuni.

We have 129 files changed, 6254 insertions(+), 1877 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/19>

Diff to last release: [v3.3.2...v3.3.3](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.3.2...v3.3.3)

**Announcements**:

* None

**New**:

* Uyuni Proxies can now be set with the schema validation. [#3061](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3061)
* Cobbler should now build on AlmaLinux. [#3064](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3064)
* The initrd is not required anymore as it is an optional file. [#3127](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3127)
* XML-RPC: Added `dump_vars` endpoint. This is intended to replace `get_blended_data` as of 3.4.0. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* XML-RPC: Added `get_item_resolved_value` ([#3056](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3056)) & `set_item_resolved_value` ([#3134](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3134)) endpoints.

**Breaking Changes**:

* The field `virt_file_size` is now a float and the related settings as well. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)

**Changes**:

* The error messages for duplicated objects now contains the name of the duplicated object. [#3129](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3129)

**Bugfixes**:

* Dictionaries had the wrong value set for `<<inherit>>` [#3128](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3128)
* There were some cases in which the autoinstallation manager was handed the wrong object and then crashed. [#3130](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3130)
* The inheritance of the `owners` field was fixed. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* Serial Console options should not contain bogous `-1` value anymore. [#3105](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3105)
* HTTP API should not throw permission errors anymore. [#3046](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3046) [#3080](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3080)
* During build the log was not visible due to a custom logger without output. [#3059](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3059)
* `cobbler mkloaders` now also copies dependencies of `menu.c32`. [#3058](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3058)
* We now generate the grub configuration for the architectures correct again. [#3097](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3097)
* `virt_file_size` now is a float at all times. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)
* Cobbler should restart successfully now if you have attached an image to a system. [#3044](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3044)
* If you have a system named `default` the bootloader was not removed properly before. [#3045](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3045)
* `cobbler buildiso`: The `isolinux.cfg` was not properly formatted. [#3047](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3047)
* There were unharmful templating errors in the log related to `redhat_management_type`. The parts depending on this were removed. [#3048](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3048)
* The DNS managers were non-functional before because of a not existing function call. [#3049](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3049)
* `cobbler buildiso` failed with `--tmpdir`s that don't end in `buildiso`. [#3050](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3050)
* `cobbler buildiso` had outdated docs and help messages for some parameters. [#3051](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3051)
* `cobbler import`: It was impossible to import Rocky Linux 8.5 successfully. [#3052](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3052)
* Cobbler created duplicated settings files before. [#3053](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3053)
* `cobbler sync` was broken by refactoring to `shell=False` before. [#3054](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3054)

**Other**:

We have 422 files changed, 25375 insertions(+), 34826 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/10>

Diff to last release: [v3.2.1...v3.3.0](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0)

**Known Issues**:

* `cobbler <item> rename` is not working currently
* `cobbler <item> edit` may have bugs due to the internal refactorings

**Breaking Changes**:

* The webinterface got removed [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2434) [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2286) [#2700](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2700)
  + Please use the CLI in the meantime
  + A new webinterface is under development at <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler-web>
  + The core code has priority at any time. There are third party tools available which provide a webinterface and use

    Cobbler as a backend. A list of those tools can be found at the bottom of the following page: <https://cobbler.github.io/users.html>
* The Cobbler internal TFTP Demon got removed [#2512](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2512)
* `yaboot` support got removed as a bootloader for PowerPC [#2723](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2723)

**Announcements**:

* Important Security Bugfixes [#2794](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2794) [#2795](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795)
  + Arbitrary Read was possible through `generate_script()`
  + Arbitrary Write was possible through `upload_log_data()`
  + Log poisoning with Remote-Code-Execution was possible through any XMLRPC method which logs to the logfile.
* There was an internal refactoring from runtime created Python attributes to Python Properties. This allows much

  better data validation and thus better error handling but also introduced new bugs.

![Hello World](/theme/images/bcfg2_logo.png)

Bcfg2 helps system administrators produce a consistent, reproducible, and
verifiable description of their environment, and offers visualization and
reporting tools to aid in day-to-day administrative tasks. It is the fifth
generation of configuration management tools developed in the [Mathematics and
Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.mcs.anl.gov).

It is based on an operational model in which the specification can be used to
validate and optionally change the state of clients, but in a feature unique to
Bcfg2 the client's response to the specification can also be used to assess the
completeness of the specification. Using this feature, Bcfg2 provides an
objective measure of how good a job an administrator has done in specifying the
configuration of client systems. Bcfg2 is therefore built to help
administrators construct an accurate, comprehensive specification.

Bcfg2 has been designed from the ground up to support gentle reconciliation
between the specification and current client states. It is designed to
gracefully cope with manual system modifications.

Finally, due to the rapid pace of updates on modern networks, client systems
are constantly changing; if required in your environment, Bcfg2 can enable the
construction of complex change management and deployment strategies.

Bcfg2 is fairly portable. It has been successfully run on:

* [AIX](http://www.ibm.com/aix), [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/), [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/), [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org/), [Solaris](http://www.oracle.com/solaris/)
* Many [GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) distributions, including [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/), [ArchLinux](http://www.archlinux.org/), [Blag](http://www.blagblagblag.org/), [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/), [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/), [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/), [gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/), [Mandriva](http://www.mandriva.com/), [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/), [Red Hat/RHEL](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/), [SuSE/SLES](http://www.novell.com/linux), [Trisquel](http://trisquel.info/), and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

Bcfg2 should run on any POSIX compatible operating system, however direct
support for an operating system's package and service formats are limited by
the currently available [client tools](http://docs.bcfg2.org/dev/client/tools.html) (new client tools are pretty easy to add).
There is also an [incomplete but more exact list of platforms on which Bcfg2 works](http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/wiki/EncapPlatforms).

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

# Cheetah3, the Python-Powered Template Engine[¶](#cheetah3-the-python-powered-template-engine "Permalink to this headline")

## Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permalink to this headline")

Cheetah3 is a free and [open source](https://github.com/CheetahTemplate3/cheetah3) template engine and
code-generation tool written in [Python](http://python.org). Cheetah can be
used unto itself, or incorporated with other technologies and stacks regardless
of whether they’re written in Python or not.

At its core, Cheetah is a domain-specific language for markup generation and
templating which allows for full integration with existing Python code but also
offers extensions to traditional Python syntax to allow for easier text-generation.

It’s a fork of the [original](https://github.com/cheetahtemplate/cheetah)
CheetahTemplate library.

### Talk Cheetah[¶](#talk-cheetah "Permalink to this headline")

You can get involved and talk with Cheetah developers on the [Cheetah3 issue
tracker](https://github.com/CheetahTemplate3/cheetah3/issues).

## Cheetah in a nutshell[¶](#cheetah-in-a-nutshell "Permalink to this headline")

Below is a simple example of some Cheetah code, as you can see it’s practically
Python. You can import, inherit and define methods just like in a regular Python
module, since that’s what your Cheetah templates are compiled to :)

```
#from Cheetah.Template import Template
#extends Template

#set $people = [{'name' : 'Tom', 'mood' : 'Happy'}, {'name' : 'Dick',
                        'mood' : 'Sad'}, {'name' : 'Harry', 'mood' : 'Hairy'}]

<strong>How are you feeling?</strong>
<ul>
    #for $person in $people
        <li>
            $person['name'] is $person['mood']
        </li>
    #end for
</ul>

```

## Why Cheetah?[¶](#why-cheetah "Permalink to this headline")

* Cheetah is supported by every major Python web framework.
* It is fully documented and is supported by an active user community.
* It can output/generate any text-based format.
* Cheetah compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.
* It blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template language that non-programmers can understand.
* It gives template authors full access to any Python data structure, module, function, object, or method in their templates. Meanwhile, it provides a way for administrators to selectively restrict access to Python when needed.
* Cheetah makes code reuse easy by providing an object-oriented interface to templates that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates. One template can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of it. Cheetah templates can be subclasses of any Python class and vice-versa.
* It provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can dramatically improve the performance of a dynamic website.
* It encourages clean separation of content, graphic design, and program code. This leads to highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures, shorter development time, and HTML and program code that is easier to understand and maintain. It is particularly well suited for team efforts.
* Cheetah can be used to generate static html via its command-line tool.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c0)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-13 14:58:45 UTC  ``` Routines in the following files use HTTP protocol instead of a more secure HTTPS: ./actions/buildiso.py ./actions/replicate.py ./actions/reposync.py ./api.py ./autoinstallgen.py ./cli.py ./grub.py ./items/distro.py ./items/repo.py ./modules/authentication/configfile.py ./modules/authentication/denyall.py ./modules/authentication/pam.py ./modules/authentication/testing.py ./modules/installation/post_puppet.py ./modules/installation/pre_puppet.py ./modules/managers/bind.py ./modules/managers/import_signatures.py ./services.py ./tftpgen.py ./utils.py ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c1)  Enno Gotthold   2021-12-17 08:59:32 UTC  ``` Thanks for the finding!  When fixing this we need to keep in mind that not all machines are physically capable of using HTTPS during PXE or HTTP Boot. The same is valid for the early OS boot stage.  What should be included in my mind is that on the upstream documentation we provide notice in a visible way that other means of security (dedicated installation networks, ...) should be taken. ```

False),   I found the following groups:      Repository mirror related: Hosting repository mirrors per default with HTTPS is not even done for the openSUSE Leap repositories. While it is technically possible, it is hard to do as all systems need to trust the certificate used by the mirror. Additionally we do accept (./cobbler/items/repo.py) HTTPS mirror URLs.     Autoinstallation related: The only way to enable HTTPS here is if all components involved do support embedding an SSL certificate. This would be: firmware, GRUB, system installers & the os itself. Since I cannot guarantee that the firmware supports adding custom SSL certificates with all hardware used together with Cobbler, I cannot make this the default. Achieving HTTP Boot is (as simple as it is) not done. Many people still execute PXE installations (which is even more unsecure).     supervisord API: Is not setup per default with HTTPS and thus we cannot assume that it is available. Communication is additionally only done via localhost.     XML Namespaces: They are served via HTTP in most cases if I am not mistaken. Same reasoning as at "Autoinstallation related"     Documentation: Irrelevant as this is not code which is able to be executed.     Settings: These are meant for reasonable defaults. Uyuni/SUSE Manager does not make use of the proxy settings which are set to HTTP per default. I cannot assume that the proxy is able to talk HTTPS and I don't see a way of auto-determining if a proxy speaks HTTP or HTTPS.     Test data: irrelevant because never deployed to customers.  TLDR: I don't see any chance to make HTTPS anywhere the default. The patch I have locally fixes some documentation and code URLs.  Long-Term what we can try (out-of-scope for this CVE imho) is, that we refactor the URL generation and then have a central place where we can control this. However this is also hard in regard to the fact that in the templates we have Python functions available but they don't have to be used. People can just hardcode an HTTP URL in there and destroy all our efforts. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c5)  Paolo Perego   2022-02-03 10:31:10 UTC  ``` For this issue me and Enno agreed that we need some more time to elaborate a good strategy for this. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c6)  Thomas Leroy   2022-02-04 11:21:01 UTC  ``` We have matches for "http://" in every maintained codestreams of Cobbler.

As far as I know, we have no patches ready for this CVE (only for CVE-2021-45082 and CVE-2021-45083). ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c9)  Paolo Perego   2022-02-16 14:19:03 UTC  ``` Hi Alexander, this is correct.  As I agreed with Enno, fixing this CVE requires more effort and some more time to figure it out an elegant way to provide an HTTPS only scenario. So this CVE will be disclosed but not fixed at the moment (it's not that risky). ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c10)  Thomas Leroy   2022-08-29 14:53:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paolo Perego from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1193683#c9)) > Hi Alexander, this is correct. >  > As I agreed with Enno, fixing this CVE requires more effort and some more > time to figure it out an elegant way to provide an HTTPS only scenario. > So this CVE will be disclosed but not fixed at the moment (it's not that > risky).

It is technically impossible to fix this in the way it was intended by the CVE description, still I will try to do my best to improve security. So this will be now actively worked on again. ``` |  |

# The tinydns-data program

This is a reference page.
For tutorial information,
see the instructions for
[running a DNS server](run-server.html).

tinydns-data
reads local DNS information
from a file named data in the current directory.
It creates data.cdb in a binary format designed for
fast access by [tinydns](tinydns.html).
It may also create some other files
with names beginning with data.

tinydns-data
updates data.cdb atomically,
so you can use it safely while tinydns is running.
If anything goes wrong with the creation of data.cdb,
tinydns-data stops and leaves the old data.cdb in place.
## Data format

The DNS information in data is a series of lines.
There are several types of lines, as shown below.

Each line starts with a special character
and continues with a series of colon-separated fields.
In some cases the fields may be omitted;
however, all colons must be included except at the end of the line.
Spaces and tabs at the end of a line are ignored.
Blank lines are ignored.

Each line contains a *ttl* (``time to live'')
specifying the number of seconds that the line's DNS records may be cached.
Beware that cache times below 300 seconds
will be treated as 300 by some clients,
and NS cache times below 2 seconds can cause lookup failures.
You may omit *ttl*;
tinydns-data will use default cache times,
carefully selected to work well in normal situations.

You may include a timestamp on each line.
If *ttl* is nonzero (or omitted),
the timestamp is a starting time
for the information in the line;
the line will be ignored before that time.
If *ttl* is zero,
the timestamp is an ending time (``time to die'')
for the information in the line;
tinydns dynamically adjusts *ttl*
so that the line's DNS records are not cached for more than a few seconds
past the ending time.
A timestamp is an
[external TAI64 timestamp](../libtai/tai64.html#tai64),
printed as 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters.
For example, the lines
```

     +www.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4:0:4000000038af1379
     +www.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.7::4000000038af1379

```
specify that www.heaven.af.mil will have address 1.2.3.4
until time 4000000038af1379 (2000-02-19 22:04:31 UTC)
and will then switch to IP address 1.2.3.7.

For versions 1.04 and above:
You may include a client location on each line.
The line is ignored for clients outside that location.
Client locations are specified by % lines:
```

     %lo:ipprefix

```
means that IP addresses starting with *ipprefix*
are in location *lo*.
*lo*
is a sequence of one or two ASCII letters.
A client is in only one location;
longer prefixes override shorter prefixes.
For example,
```

     %in:192.168
     %ex
     +jupiter.heaven.af.mil:192.168.1.2:::in
     +jupiter.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4:::ex

```
specifies that
jupiter.heaven.af.mil
has address 192.168.1.2 for clients in the 192.168.\* network
and address 1.2.3.4 for everyone else.
## Common data lines

---

```

     .fqdn:ip:x:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Name server for our domain *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates

* an NS (``name server'') record
  showing *x*.ns.*fqdn*
  as a name server for *fqdn*;* an A (``address'') record showing *ip* as the IP address
    of *x*.ns.*fqdn*; and* an SOA (``start of authority'') record for *fqdn*
      listing *x*.ns.*fqdn* as the primary name server
      and hostmaster@*fqdn* as the contact address.

You may have several name servers for one domain,
with a different *x* for each server.
tinydns will return only one SOA record per domain.

If *x* contains a dot
then tinydns-data will use
*x* as the server name
rather than *x*.ns.*fqdn*.
This feature is provided only for compatibility reasons;
names not ending with *fqdn*
will force clients to contact parent servers
much more often than they otherwise would,
and will reduce the overall reliability of DNS.
You should omit *ip*
if *x* has IP addresses assigned elsewhere in data;
in this case, tinydns-data will omit the A record.

Examples:
```

     .panic.mil:1.8.7.55:a

```
creates
an NS record showing a.ns.panic.mil
as a name server for panic.mil,
an A record showing 1.8.7.55 as the IP address
of a.ns.panic.mil, and
an SOA record for panic.mil.
```

     .panic.mil:1.8.7.56:dns2.panic.mil

```
creates
an NS record showing dns2.panic.mil
as a name server for panic.mil,
an A record showing 1.8.7.56 as the IP address
of dns2.panic.mil, and
an SOA record for panic.mil.
```

     .panic.mil::a.ns.heaven.af.mil

```
creates
an NS record showing a.ns.heaven.af.mil
as a name server for panic.mil,
and an SOA record for panic.mil.

---

```

     &fqdn:ip:x:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Name server for domain *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates

* an NS record
  showing *x*.ns.*fqdn*
  as a name server for *fqdn* and* an A record showing *ip* as the IP address
    of *x*.ns.*fqdn*.

If *x* contains a dot
then it is treated specially; see above.

You may have several name servers for one domain,
with a different *x* for each server.

Normally & is used
for domains delegated by this server to child servers,
while . is used for domains delegated to this server.

Examples:
```

     &serious.panic.mil:1.8.248.6:a

```
creates
an NS record showing a.ns.serious.panic.mil
as a name server for serious.panic.mil,
and an A record showing 1.8.248.6 as the IP address
of a.ns.serious.panic.mil.
```

     &serious.panic.mil:1.8.248.7:ns7.panic.mil

```
creates
an NS record showing ns7.panic.mil
as a name server for serious.panic.mil,
and an A record showing 1.8.248.7 as the IP address
of ns7.panic.mil.

---

```

     =fqdn:ip:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Host *fqdn* with IP address *ip*.
tinydns-data creates

* an A record showing *ip* as
  the IP address of *fqdn* and* a PTR (``pointer'') record showing *fqdn* as
    the name of *d*.*c*.*b*.*a*.in-addr.arpa
    if *ip* is *a*.*b*.*c*.*d*.

Remember to specify name servers for some suffix of *fqdn*;
otherwise tinydns will not respond
to queries about *fqdn*.
The same comment applies to other records described below.
Similarly, remember to specify name servers for some suffix of
*d*.*c*.*b*.*a*.in-addr.arpa,
if that domain has been delegated to you.

Example:
```

     =button.panic.mil:1.8.7.108

```
creates an A record showing 1.8.7.108
as the IP address of button.panic.mil,
and a PTR record showing button.panic.mil
as the name of 108.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa.

---

```

     +fqdn:ip:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Alias *fqdn* with IP address *ip*.
This is just like =*fqdn*:*ip*:*ttl*
except that tinydns-data does not create the PTR record.

For versions 1.04 and above:
tinydns returns addresses
(from + or = or @ or . or &
lines)
in a random order in the answer section.
If there are more than 8 records,
it returns a random set of 8.

Example:
```

     +button.panic.mil:1.8.7.109

```
creates an A record showing 1.8.7.109
as another IP address for button.panic.mil.

---

```

     @fqdn:ip:x:dist:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Mail exchanger for *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates

* an MX (``mail exchanger'') record
  showing *x*.mx.*fqdn*
  as a mail exchanger for *fqdn* at distance *dist*
  and* an A record showing *ip* as the IP address
    of *x*.mx.*fqdn*.

You may omit *dist*;
the default distance is 0.

If *x* contains a dot
then it is treated specially; see above.

You may create several MX records for *fqdn*,
with a different *x* for each server.
Make sure to arrange for the SMTP server on each IP address
to accept mail for *fqdn*.

Example:
```

     @panic.mil:1.8.7.88:mail.panic.mil

```
creates an MX record showing mail.panic.mil
as a mail exchanger for panic.mil at distance 0,
and an A record showing 1.8.7.88 as the IP address of
mail.panic.mil.

---

```

     #comment

```
Comment line. The line is ignored.

---

## Uncommon data lines

---

```

     -fqdn:ip:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
For versions 1.04 and above:
This type of line is used by
programs that automatically edit + lines in data
to temporarily exclude addresses of overloaded or dead machines.
The line is ignored.

---

```

     'fqdn:s:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
TXT (``text'') record for *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates a TXT record for *fqdn*
containing the string *s*.
You may use octal \*nnn* codes
to include arbitrary bytes inside *s*;
for example, \072 is a colon.

---

```

     ^fqdn:p:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
PTR record for *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates a PTR record for *fqdn*
pointing to the domain name *p*.

---

```

     Cfqdn:p:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
CNAME (``canonical name'') record for *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates a CNAME record for *fqdn*
pointing to the domain name *p*.

Don't use C*fqdn*
if there are any other records for *fqdn*.
Don't use C*fqdn*
for common aliases;
use +*fqdn* instead.
Remember the wise words of Inigo Montoya:
``You keep using CNAME records.
I do not think they mean what you think they mean.''

---

```

     Zfqdn:mname:rname:ser:ref:ret:exp:min:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
SOA record for *fqdn*
showing *mname* as the primary name server,
*rname* (with the first . converted to @)
as the contact address,
*ser* as the serial number,
*ref* as the refresh time,
*ret* as the retry time,
*exp* as the expire time, and
*min* as the minimum time.
*ser*,
*ref*,
*ret*,
*exp*, and
*min*
may be omitted;
they default to, respectively,
the modification time of the data file,
16384 seconds,
2048 seconds,
1048576 seconds, and
2560 seconds.

---

```

     :fqdn:n:rdata:ttl:timestamp:lo

```
Generic record for *fqdn*.
tinydns-data creates a record of type *n*
for *fqdn*
showing *rdata*.
*n* must be an integer between 1 and 65535;
it must not be
2 (NS), 5 (CNAME), 6 (SOA), 12 (PTR), 15 (MX), or 252 (AXFR).
The proper format of *rdata* depends on *n*.
You may use octal \*nnn* codes
to include arbitrary bytes inside *rdata*.

---

## Wildcards

tinydns supports wildcards of the form \*.*fqdn*.
Information for \*.*fqdn*
is provided for every name ending with .*fqdn*,
*except* names that have their own records
and names that are covered by more specific wildcards.

For example, the lines
```

     +pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     +*.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200

```
have the same effect as
```

     +pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     +joe.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +bill.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +ishtar.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +joe.bob.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +sally.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200
     +post.pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.200

```
and so on.

As another example, the lines
```

     +pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     @*.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil

```
have the same effect as
```

     +pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     @joe.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @bill.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @floyd.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @ishtar.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @joe.bob.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @sally.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil
     @post.pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil::mail.heaven.af.mil

```
and so on.
Notice that the wildcard does not apply to
pink.floyd.u.heaven.af.mil,
because that name has its own records.
## A typical data file

```

     =lion.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     @heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.4
     @3.2.1.in-addr.arpa:1.2.3.4

     =tiger.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.5
     .heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.5:a
     .3.2.1.in-addr.arpa:1.2.3.5:a

     =bear.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.6
     .heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.6:b
     .3.2.1.in-addr.arpa:1.2.3.6:b

     =cheetah.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.248
     =panther.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.249

```
Here is the same information in BIND zone-file format,
with the two zones merged:
```

     heaven.af.mil. 2560 IN SOA a.ns.heaven.af.mil. hostmaster.heaven.af.mil. ...
     heaven.af.mil. 259200 IN NS a.ns.heaven.af.mil.
     heaven.af.mil. 259200 IN NS b.ns.heaven.af.mil.
     heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN MX mx.heaven.af.mil.

     3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 2560 IN SOA a.ns.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. hostmaster.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. ...
     3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 259200 IN NS a.ns.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.
     3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 259200 IN NS b.ns.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.
     3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN MX mx.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.

     4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR lion.heaven.af.mil.
     lion.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.4
     mx.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.4
     mx.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.4

     5.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR tiger.heaven.af.mil.
     tiger.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.5
     a.ns.heaven.af.mil. 259200 IN A 1.2.3.5
     a.ns.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 259200 IN A 1.2.3.5

     6.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR bear.heaven.af.mil.
     bear.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.6
     b.ns.heaven.af.mil. 259200 IN A 1.2.3.6
     b.ns.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 259200 IN A 1.2.3.6

     248.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR cheetah.heaven.af.mil.
     cheetah.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.248

     249.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN PTR panther.heaven.af.mil.
     panther.heaven.af.mil. 86400 IN A 1.2.3.249

```
## Design notes

The data format is very easy for programs to edit,
and reasonably easy for humans to edit,
unlike the traditional zone-file format.

tinydns-data
could support a name wherever an IP address is required;
it would look up the name in DNS and use the resulting address.
This would reliably track changes in offsite IP addresses
if the database were rebuilt periodically.

## What People Say About Puppet

### “Our IT operations process was manual and risk-prone. We needed a tool that would support us with infrastructure automation and [compliance] bookkeeping.”
