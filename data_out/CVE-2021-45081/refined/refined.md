{
  "CVE-2021-45081": {
    "Description": "A lot of cobbler server entry-points are served on HTTP rather than HTTPS.",
    "Root cause": "The Cobbler server uses HTTP protocol for many of its entry points instead of HTTPS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unencrypted communication",
      "Lack of TLS/SSL"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential for eavesdropping and tampering by network attackers on sensitive information transmitted via HTTP.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks",
      "Network sniffing",
       "Adjacent Network access"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker positioned on the same network as the Cobbler server, or capable of intercepting network traffic between the server and its clients, can potentially eavesdrop or tamper with data.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability affects cobbler server and koan, and products built using cobbler such as SUSE Manager. A fix is not available at the time of disclosure. The decision to use HTTP stems from the complexities of certificate management and the challenges of supporting HTTPS across diverse customer setups. There is a plan for future work on a certificate enrolling and trusting layer."
