- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Aptos WISAL payroll accounting software uses hardcoded database credentials in the Windows client application to retrieve all usernames and passwords from the Sybase ASE database. This is done over an unencrypted connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hardcoded database credentials in the client application.
    - Unencrypted network connection to the database server.
    - Transmission of cleartext passwords in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can gain read and write access to personally identifiable information (PII) and payroll data.
    - Attackers can impersonate legitimate users, compromising the integrity of the audit log.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Machine-in-the-middle attacks on the unencrypted network connection between the WISAL client and the Sybase database server.
    - Attackers with access to the WISAL client application and its configuration can extract all user passwords, even with an encrypted connection, due to the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack on the network.
    - Access to the WISAL client application and its configuration.
