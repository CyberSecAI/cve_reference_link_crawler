Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-32738:

**CVE-2024-32738 - SQLi in mcu.jar!com.cyberpower.mcu.core.persist.MCUDBHelper.query\_ptask\_lean**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `query_ptask_lean` method of the `MCUDBHelper` class within the `mcu.jar` file. The method directly incorporates a user-supplied parameter (`contract_uuid`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized user-supplied input in the `contract_uuid` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   **Data Exposure:** Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Potentially modify or delete data, depending on the database permissions and the injected SQL query.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Cause a denial of service by injecting resource-intensive queries that impact performance or crash the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network using HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerable code snippet:
    ```java
     public PdncConfigLeanResp query_ptask_lean(String contract_uuid) throws DataAccessException {
       String q_str = String.format("select numofdevice, numsuccess, numfailed, modifiedtime from pcontractresult where contract = '%s';", new Object[] { contract_uuid });
       return (PdncConfigLeanResp)this.jdbcTemplate.query(q_str, (ResultSetExtractor)new Object(this));
     }
    ```
    *   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection:
        ```
        curl "<http://<target-host>>:8085/api/v1/ndconfig?mode=lean&uid=1'%20UNION%20select%201,2,3,sqlite_version();--"
        ```
        This injects `1' UNION select 1,2,3,sqlite_version();--` into the SQL query which retrieves the sqlite version.
*   **Affected Product:** CyberPower PowerPanel Enterprise prior to v2.8.3
