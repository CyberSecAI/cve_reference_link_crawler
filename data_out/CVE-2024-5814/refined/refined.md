  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello when downgrading from TLS 1.3.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of downgrading from TLS 1.3 to 1.2.",
      "Incomplete parsing of server hello message during downgrade."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious TLS1.2 server can establish a successful connection using a ciphersuite not agreed upon by the TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious TLS 1.2 server targeting a TLS 1.3 client with downgrade capability."
