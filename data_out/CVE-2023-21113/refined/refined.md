Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how `AttributionSource` uses `Binder.getCallingUid()` to verify the UID of a caller from another process. `getCallingUid()` doesn't always behave as expected. If an `AttributionSource` is unparceled outside a transaction thread, `getCallingUid()` will return the UID of the current process instead of the caller's. If the current process is a system process, the UID check can be bypassed, allowing any UID to be provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect UID Verification:** The primary weakness is the reliance on `Binder.getCallingUid()` in scenarios where it doesn't accurately reflect the caller's UID.
- **Bypassed UID Check:** When an `AttributionSource` is unparceled in a system process outside of a transaction thread, the vulnerability allows an attacker to provide any UID and effectively bypass the intended access control mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges locally on the device. By bypassing the UID check, a malicious app can perform actions that it normally wouldn't have permission to. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, and other unauthorized access to the system.
- **Arbitrary UID spoofing**: The vulnerability allows a malicious application to impersonate any UID on the system, which could be a system service with high privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning an attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **Inter-Process Communication:** The attack involves communication between a malicious app and a vulnerable system component that uses `AttributionSource` objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Malicious App:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **Ability to Interact with Vulnerable Component:** The attacker's malicious app needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable system component through Binder calls and provide crafted `AttributionSource` objects.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves emptying out the state of the `AttributionSource` object when it is unparceled outside a transaction thread. This will cause any subsequent permission checks to fail, preventing privilege escalation.
- This vulnerability is addressed in Android versions 12, 12L, and 13.
- Multiple code changes were made to address the issue, including changes in the `platform/build/soong`, `frameworks/base`, and `prebuilts/module_sdk/Wifi` repositories.
- The commit message explicitly states: "This patch fixes the vulnerability by emptying out the state of the AttributionSource, so that the service checking its credentials will fail to give permission to the app."

In summary, CVE-2023-21113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a local attacker to bypass UID checks when a crafted `AttributionSource` is used in a specific context by exploiting the limitations of `Binder.getCallingUid()`.
