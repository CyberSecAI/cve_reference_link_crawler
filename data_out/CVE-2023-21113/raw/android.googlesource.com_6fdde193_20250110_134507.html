            java_sdk_library_import: Copy all prebuilt properties to child modulesPreviously, only the prefer property was copied from thejava_sdk_library_import module to its child modules which meant that ifthe use_source_config_var property was used to control the preferproperty that the child modules would never be used. That can causebuild breakages when building against prebuilts as some parts of thebuild will use prebuilt files from java_sdk_library_import and somewill use source files from the corresponding java_sdk_library.This change copies the use_source_config_var property too.It also adds tests to verify that dependencies on child modules of ajava_sdk_library use the prebuilt child modules of the correspondingjava_sdk_library_import. That revealed a bug with the handling of stubsources where the prefer property was set after creating the modulewhich has also been fixed.Bug: 249192297Test: m nothing      # Cherry pick into branch broken by previous behavior and make      # sure that it fixes it.(cherry picked from commit on android-review.googlesource.com host: bf4de041de611de4b3ec24c5f261c4293522961a)(cherry picked from commit 8ab8056a4f9de6cec1fdedc7d49502439ea7aef6)(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:6fa44c197335a8bea4f96cce3296f5c92d8dd7e7)Merged-In: I5719c257f8457bcb2238bc7965215512a20f1095Change-Id: I5719c257f8457bcb2238bc7965215512a20f1095
