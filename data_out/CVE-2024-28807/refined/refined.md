- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cleartext storage of sensitive information (user passwords) in the memory of the @CT desktop management application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passwords of various users are stored in memory in cleartext for extended periods during @CT runtime.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Guest OS administrators can obtain user passwords by accessing memory dumps of the desktop application. This allows them to potentially gain unauthorized access to the system and its resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing memory dumps of the @CT desktop application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a guest OS administrator with the ability to access memory dumps of the desktop application.
