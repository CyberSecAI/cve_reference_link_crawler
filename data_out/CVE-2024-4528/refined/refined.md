Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `txtfullname` parameter, before it is echoed back into the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The `txtfullname` parameter is not sanitized or encoded when being displayed in the HTML context on pages `/Admin/add-admin.php` and `/Admin/user-record.php`, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This could lead to a variety of impacts including:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `txtfullname` parameter in HTTP POST requests to `/Admin/add-admin.php` and during display of content on `/Admin/user-record.php`.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and submits it via the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP POST requests to the `/Admin/add-admin.php` page. This could be achieved via a form submission, or by an attacker intercepting the request and modifying it before it reaches the server.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the `txtfullname` parameter.
- Additionally the attacker would need to convince a victim to visit `/Admin/user-record.php` to trigger the xss in that context.
