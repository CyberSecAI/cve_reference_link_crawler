Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-28604

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `fluid_components` TYPO3 extension not properly sanitizing user-controlled data when used as a component argument parameter, specifically when the component expects raw HTML content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, arising from the ability to inject malicious scripts through unsanitized user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into web pages, leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities within the context of the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Controlled Data as Component Argument:** An attacker could craft malicious input designed to be used as a component's argument, which is then rendered without proper sanitization.
- **Specifically, the `content` parameter:** When a component uses the predefined `{content}` parameter and allows HTML markup using `f:format.raw()`, and a variable containing HTML is passed without encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to influence component parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to control the data that is being passed as a component's argument parameter. This might be achieved through:
    - Direct input in a form or other user interface that is then used as the component parameter.
    - Indirect injection through other vulnerabilities that allow data manipulation.
- **No specific privilege level is mentioned**: It appears that a standard user could potentially trigger this by providing malicious input.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

- **Affected Versions:** Versions 3.4.3 and below of the `fluid_components` extension are affected.
- **Solution:** Update to version 3.5.0 or higher of the `fluid_components` extension.
- **Mitigation:** The updated version introduces a new `SlotViewHelper` which must be used to safely render HTML markup passed to a component as an argument.
- **Detection Tool:** A CLI tool `fluidcomponents:checkContentEscaping` is provided to help identify potentially problematic templates.
- **Breaking Change:** The fix requires manual template changes to ensure HTML markup is correctly rendered. This includes adding `f:format.raw()` or `f:format.html()` ViewHelpers where HTML markup is passed to a component parameter to prevent double encoding, and use of `fc:slot()` to render HTML content within components.
- **Credit:** Helmut Hummel is credited with reporting the vulnerability and Simon Praetorius for providing updated versions of the extension.

In essence, the core issue was that the extension was not sanitizing user input before rendering it as HTML when specifically the component was configured to render it as HTML. This allowed for a classic XSS attack, which could be mitigated with output encoding and using the new `SlotViewHelper`.
