```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation when handling the 'comment' and 'entry_name' parameters in the `formIpQoS` function of the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK's `boa` web server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of the 'comment' parameter.",
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of the 'entry_name' parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/boafrm/formIpQoS` API endpoint of the web server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web server. Authentication is required for accessing the vulnerable API, as shown in the proof of concepts which require user credentials 'admin:admin'. Additionally, loading the corresponding HTML page is needed due to a CSRF protection mechanism."
