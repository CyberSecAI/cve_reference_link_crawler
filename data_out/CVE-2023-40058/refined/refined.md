- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive data was unintentionally added to a public-facing knowledge base. This data, if exploited, could allow access to components of Access Rights Manager (ARM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data disclosure in a public-facing knowledge base.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to components of Access Rights Manager (ARM). The impact includes High Confidentiality, Low Integrity and Low Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be in the same network environment as the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in the same environment as the vulnerable ARM instance. No specific user interaction or privileges are required (PR:N, UI:N).
