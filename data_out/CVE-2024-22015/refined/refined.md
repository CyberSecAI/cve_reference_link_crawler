- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in IntelÂ® Dynamic Load Balancer (DLB) driver software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The driver software fails to properly validate input, which leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local user can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for successful exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the system.
