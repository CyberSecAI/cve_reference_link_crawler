RELATED: CVE-2020-36757
 
 The provided content describes multiple instances of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in various WordPress plugins and themes. These vulnerabilities stem from missing or incorrect nonce validation, which allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions if they can trick a user, usually an administrator, into clicking a malicious link or submitting a forged request.
 
 Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:
 
 **Root Cause:**
 *   The primary root cause across all instances is the improper implementation of nonce verification in the plugins and themes. Specifically, the code often checks for the presence of a nonce but fails to enforce its validation if it's not present or if it's empty. The code snippets use conditional statements like `if (isset($_POST['nonce']) && !wp_verify_nonce($_POST['nonce'], 'action'))`, which only verify the nonce if the parameter is set, effectively bypassing the check if the parameter is missing.
 
 **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
 *   **Missing Nonce Check:** In many cases, the code uses `isset()` or `!empty()` to check if the nonce parameter is set. If the parameter is not present, the validation is skipped entirely, allowing the attacker to bypass the CSRF protection.
 *   **Incorrect Logic:** Some code snippets use `!isset()` or `empty()` in conjunction with `&&` or `||` operators which creates flawed logic leading to the verification being skipped under certain conditions. For example, `if (! isset( $_POST['some-nonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['some-nonce'], 'some-nonce' ) )` will only check the nonce if it's *not* set.
 
 **Impact of Exploitation:**
 *   The impact of successful exploitation varies across the listed plugins and themes:
     *   **Settings Modification:** Attackers can change plugin or theme settings without authorization.
     *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data in the database, including product details, user profiles, or other stored information.
     *   **Account Compromise:** Attackers might be able to add malicious order items.
     *   **Arbitrary Actions:** Execute arbitrary actions that the vulnerable plugin/theme exposes
     *   **XSS:** While not all listed vulnerabilities directly lead to XSS, some can be chained with other vulnerabilities in the vulnerable plugin to achieve XSS (stored or reflected).
 
 **Attack Vectors:**
 *   The primary attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The attacker crafts a malicious request that targets a vulnerable action in the plugin or theme.
 *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user (usually an administrator) into initiating the malicious request by clicking a link or visiting a malicious site or executing malicious javascript code.
 
 **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
 *   The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress site or any user credentials.
 *   The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to interact with malicious content (e.g., via a crafted link).
 *  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint of the vulnerable plugin or theme and any required parameters.
 
 **Additional Notes:**
 * The content includes multiple blog posts from nintechnet.com, each detailing various plugins and themes that were found vulnerable to CSRF attacks using similar improper nonce verification methods.
 * The content also includes information from Wordfence which references the same vulnerabilities and the researchers that discovered them.
 *  The provided code snippets show the vulnerable code sections, demonstrating how the missing or incorrect nonce validation leads to the CSRF bypass.
 *  The content mentions a fix for the WP Hotel Booking plugin in the wordpress.org trac, showing a fix for the nonce verification.
