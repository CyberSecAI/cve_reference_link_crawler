The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0390.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iZZi connect application contains hard-coded, static credentials for accessing the MQTT queue, which is also used by the "reQnet iZZi" recuperation devices.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to manage and read parameters of the "reQnet iZZi" recuperation unit by using the hardcoded credentials.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could extract the hardcoded credentials from the iZZi connect application and use them to access the MQTT queue.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain the hardcoded credentials from the application and use them to connect to the MQTT queue. This could involve reverse engineering the application.
