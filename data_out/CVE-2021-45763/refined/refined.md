      "input": "Crafted MP4 file (poc_11.zip) with specific structure that triggers the bug in BIFS scene parsing.",

    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to trigger the vulnerability.",
	"more_info":"The crash occurs due to invalid memory access within the `gf_node_changed` function. The `call rax` instruction attempts to execute code at an invalid memory location (`0x1`). This is preceded by logic to retrieve a function pointer from a structure. The invalid address indicates a null function pointer is being called. The crash occurs in the context of processing BIFS commands within the MP4 file, specifically during scene parsing. The provided backtrace and gdb debugging session pinpoint `gf_node_changed` as the root cause and identifies the call to `rax` as the point of failure. The `gf_sg_reset`, `gf_sg_del`, `gf_sg_proto_del` and `gf_bifs_dec_proto_list` are all part of the call stack."
