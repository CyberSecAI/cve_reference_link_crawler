The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46324.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs when converting an array to a function parameter due to an unterminated string. Specifically, the `jsvNewFromString` function in `src/jsvar.c` at line 910 overflows the buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow in `jsvNewFromString` function. The `jsvAddNamedChild` function in `src/jsvar.c` at line 2581 calls `jsvNewFromString` and is part of the call stack that leads to the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** The stack buffer overflow can lead to a crash, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution by corrupting the stack.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specific JavaScript code structure that includes an array being concatenated and then used as part of a function parameter. The provided test case demonstrates this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide arbitrary JavaScript code to the Espruino interpreter.
