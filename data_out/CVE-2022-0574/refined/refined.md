The provided content is a GitHub commit diff and a page from huntr.dev. The GitHub commit relates to a fix in the publify project and adds logic to prevent comments on unpublished articles, while the huntr.dev page is generic website content.

Based on the commit message "Do not allow comments on Article if not published", and the changes in the `article.rb`, `comments_controller_spec.rb` and `article_spec.rb` files, we can infer the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application allowed comments on articles that were not yet published or were in a draft state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control or input validation allowed for comments on unpublished articles.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allowing comments on unpublished articles could expose private content or allow for the injection of malicious content before an article is meant to be publicly available.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user would need to be logged in and be able to identify the article ID of an unpublished article.
- Then, by crafting a POST request to `/comments`, a malicious user could post comments before publication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be a registered user of the system, able to identify the ID of an unpublished article, and be able to craft HTTP requests.

The commit diff provided shows the fix, which ensures that comments are only allowed if the article is published and within the feedback window. This addresses the issue where unpublished or draft articles could receive comments.
