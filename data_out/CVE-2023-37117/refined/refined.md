**53.  Bug in "MPEG1or2Demux" causing "reading twice at the same time" abort (2021.08.13):**
     - **Root cause:** A bug in the demultiplexor that can lead to a read from the same source at the same time.
     -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition in the demultiplexor.
     - **Impact of exploitation:** Crash.
    - **Attack vectors:** Reading from a specific MPEG Program Stream file.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Has to be able to start a stream from the specific MPEG file that triggers the condition.

**54.  Potential memory leak in "AC3AudioStreamFramer" (2021.08.13):**
    - **Root cause:** A potential memory leak
    -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak.

    - **Attack vectors:** Triggering memory allocations in `AC3AudioStreamFramer`
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not specific.

**55.  RTSP server crash if it received successive RTSP "SETUP" commands for the same track (2021.08.09):**
     -  **Root cause:** Bug in the MPEG-1 or 2 file server demultiplexor
     -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free or related memory error.
     -  **Impact of exploitation:** Crash.
      -  **Attack vectors:** Sending multiple setup commands for the same track.
     -   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send crafted RTSP commands.

**56.   RTSP server crash if it received successive RTSP "SETUP" commands for the same track with Matroska and Ogg file server demultiplexors (2021.08.06):**
    -  **Root cause:** Use-after-free or related memory error.
    -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory management bug.
     -   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash.
     -  **Attack vectors:**  Repeatedly setting up the same track within Matroska or Ogg file streams.
     -   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires sending RTSP "SETUP" commands.

**57.  Bug in "MatroskaFileParser" that could cause a 'use after free' error (2014.06.14):**
     - **Root cause:**  A bug in the Matroska file parsing code can lead to a use after free error.
    -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use after free.
      -  **Impact of exploitation:** A crash.
     - **Attack vectors:** Parsing a specially crafted Matroska file.
      -   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to send a specific Matroska file for processing.

**58.  Integer overflow issue when seeking with absolute time (2020.07.09)**
     - **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization for `Content-Length` header causing potential overflow.
    -  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow, leading to memory corruption.
    -  **Impact of exploitation:** Server crash
