Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-48847.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to an incorrect bounds check in the `watch_queue_set_filter()` function. The code checks if the filter type value exceeds what the `type_filter` bitmap can hold. However, one of the checks uses `sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG`, which can result in a larger value than the actual number of bits available for filtering, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect bounds check:** The check `if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG)`  uses the size of the filter multiplied by the bits per long to determine the boundary, which can lead to an out-of-bounds access.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** When a filter type exceeds the actual bitmask size, the code attempts to write to memory beyond the allocated buffer. This can happen in two places:
    1. `__set_bit()` on `wfilter->type_filter`, leading to writing beyond the bitmap's allocated memory.
    2. Writing more elements into `wfilter->filters[]` than have been allocated, leading to a heap overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Kernel memory corruption:** Out-of-bounds writes can corrupt kernel memory, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Kernel panic/oops:** The KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) report in the provided text indicates that an out-of-bounds write triggers a kernel panic/oops.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause system instability.

**Attack vectors:**

- **ioctl syscall**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `watch_queue_set_filter()` function, which is likely called through an `ioctl` system call, allowing a user-space application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to call ioctl:** The attacker needs to be able to call the `ioctl` system call on a file descriptor that supports watch queues, likely requiring some level of system access.
- **Ability to craft a specific filter:** The attacker must craft a filter type value that is larger than the allowed range to trigger the out-of-bounds write, but less than `sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG`.

**Additional notes:**
The fix replaces the incorrect bounds check with `WATCH_TYPE__NR`, which is the actual number of known watch types, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds write. The provided KASAN report gives a detailed view of how the out-of-bounds write was triggered in the kernel.
