# Zip Slip Vulnerability

Zip Slip is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and  [many more (CVEs and full list here).](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)  Of course, this type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries.

![Zip Slip](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_thumb,h_225,w_225/v1527156415/research/zipslip.png)

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. zip) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as  [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java)

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. If you’d like the information on this page in a downloadable technical white paper, click the button below.

 [Download Technical White Paper](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

##### Exploitable Application Flow

The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking. Let’s look through each of these in turn. First of all, the contents of the zip file needs to have one or more files that break out of the target directory when extracted. In the example below, we can see the contents of a zip file. It has two files, a good.sh file which would be extracted into the target directory and an evil.sh file which is trying to traverse up the directory tree to hit the root and then add a file into the tmp directory. When you attempt to cd .. in the root directory, you still find yourself in the root directory, so a malicious path could contain many levels of ../ to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory, before trying to traverse to sensitive files.

```
  5 Tue Jun 5 11:04:29 BST 2018 good.sh 20 Tue Jun 5 11:04:42 BST 2018 ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.sh
```

The contents of this zip file have to be hand crafted. Archive creation tools don’t typically allow users to add files with these paths, despite the zip specification allowing it. However, with the right tools, it’s easy to create files with these paths.

 The second thing you’ll need to exploit this vulnerability is to extract the archive, either using your own code or a library. The vulnerability exists when the extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code snippet (example shown in Java) can be seen below.

```
  1   Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries = zip.getEntries();
  2   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  3       ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  4       File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  5       InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
  6       IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
  7   }
```

You can see on line 4, e.getName() is concatenated with the target directory, dir, without being validated. At this point, when our zip archive gets to our evil.sh, it will append the full path (including every ../) of the zip entry to the target directory resulting in evil.sh being written outside of the target directory.

 To see Zip Slip in action,  [watch us exploit the vulnerable java-goof application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)  , a sample application used to show many known vulnerabilities.

##### Are you Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you are either using a library which contains the Zip Slip vulnerability or your project directly contains vulnerable code, which extracts files from an archive without the necessary directory traversal validation. Snyk is maintaining a [GitHub repository listing all](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) projects that have been found vulnerable to Zip Slip and have been responsibly disclosed to, including fix dates and versions. The repository is open to contributions from the wider community to ensure it holds the most up to date status.s.

##### What action should you take?

Here are some steps you can take to check if your project’s dependencies of code contain the Zip Slip vulnerability:

##### 1. Search through your projects for vulnerable code.

JavaGroovyJavaScript.NETGoRuby & Python
##### 2. Add Zip Slip Security Testing to your application build pipeline

If you’d prefer not to search through your direct and transitive dependencies (of which you likely have hundreds) to determine if you’re using a vulnerable library, you can choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool, like Snyk. It’s a good practice to add security testing into your development lifecycle stages, such as during development, CI, deployment and production. You can test your own projects (all the ecosystems mentioned above are supported) to determine if they are vulnerable to Zip Slip.

##### Other vulnerable projects

Vulnerable projects include projects in various ecosystems that either use the libraries mentioned above or directly include vulnerable code. Of the many thousands of projects that have contained similar vulnerable code samples or accessed vulnerable libraries, the most significant include: Oracle, Amazon, Spring/Pivotal, Linkedin, Twitter, Alibaba, Jenkinsci, Eclipse, OWASP, SonarQube, OpenTable, Arduino, ElasticSearch, Selenium, JetBrains and Google.

##### Thank you!

The Snyk security team would like for thank all the vendors, project owners and the community members that helped raise awareness, find and fix vulnerabilities in projects across many ecosystems.

### Do your applications use this vulnerable package?

In a few clicks we can analyze your entire application and see what components are vulnerable in your application, and suggest you quick fixes.

This updates the `unzip-stream` dependency and goes back to using `unzip.Extract` over `unzip.Parse`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Use latest unzip-stream and unzip.Extract

Changes Made:

Updated the unzip-stream dependency.

Reverted to using unzip.Extract() instead of unzip.Parse().

Modifications across package-lock.json, package.json, RELEASES.md, download-artifact.test.ts, and download-artifact.ts.

Detailed Changes

package-lock.json:

Bumped version from 2.1.5 to 2.1.7.

Updated unzip-stream dependency from 0.3.1 to 0.3.4.

package.json:

Bumped version from 2.1.6 to 2.1.7.

RELEASES.md:

Added entry for version 2.1.7 highlighting the unzip-stream update and reversion to unzip.Extract().

download-artifact.test.ts:

Modified test to check for the existence of specific paths to ensure no path traversal.

Updated test case expectations accordingly.

download-artifact.ts:

Removed custom extraction logic and replaced with unzip.Extract().

Recommendations

Testing: Ensure all tests pass after the changes, especially the newly added path traversal checks.

Documentation: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the dependency changes and any new behavior.

Code Review: After confirming tests pass, the changes look aligned with the goals of updating dependencies and simplifying extraction logic.

Sorry, something went wrong.
