This updates the `unzip-stream` dependency and goes back to using `unzip.Extract` over `unzip.Parse`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Use latest unzip-stream and unzip.Extract

Changes Made:

Updated the unzip-stream dependency.

Reverted to using unzip.Extract() instead of unzip.Parse().

Modifications across package-lock.json, package.json, RELEASES.md, download-artifact.test.ts, and download-artifact.ts.

Detailed Changes

package-lock.json:

Bumped version from 2.1.5 to 2.1.7.

Updated unzip-stream dependency from 0.3.1 to 0.3.4.

package.json:

Bumped version from 2.1.6 to 2.1.7.

RELEASES.md:

Added entry for version 2.1.7 highlighting the unzip-stream update and reversion to unzip.Extract().

download-artifact.test.ts:

Modified test to check for the existence of specific paths to ensure no path traversal.

Updated test case expectations accordingly.

download-artifact.ts:

Removed custom extraction logic and replaced with unzip.Extract().

Recommendations

Testing: Ensure all tests pass after the changes, especially the newly added path traversal checks.

Documentation: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the dependency changes and any new behavior.

Code Review: After confirming tests pass, the changes look aligned with the goals of updating dependencies and simplifying extraction logic.

Sorry, something went wrong.
