Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `departmentDoctor.php` file in the SourceCodester Online Hospital Management System uses the PHP `$_GET` method to retrieve user input from the `deptid` parameter. This input is then directly used in a database query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `deptid` parameter, leading to potential unauthorized database access and manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** Attackers can gain database privileges, potentially leading to:
    *   Unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive information.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   If the database user has DBA privileges, the attacker could potentially gain server host privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerable `deptid` parameter is exposed through a GET request. Attackers can modify this parameter to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
